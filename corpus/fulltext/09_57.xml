<sentence id="s0">
 These reasons concern the question of costs in the principal proceedings, which were directed at the validity of the applicant's patent, and whether the respondents had infringed that patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant had, as the owner of Australian Patent 774224 A barrier, alleged that the respondents had infringed that patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondents alleged that there had been no infringement, and counter-claimed that the patent was invalid on a number of grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 11 March 2008, in reasons for judgment published on that day, I declared that Australian Patent 774224 A barrier is, and has been at all material times, invalid, and I ordered that that patent, and each of the claims of the complete specification thereof, be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On the question of costs, I then ordered that: Within 7 days of this Order, the Respondents are to file any submissions they wish to make on costs, including a draft of the Orders sought from the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Within a further 7 days, the Applicant is to file and serve any submissions it wishes to make on costs, including a draft of the orders sought from the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 18 March 2008, the respondents filed an outline of submissions on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 19 March 2008, the time for the application to file submissions was extended to 28 March 2008, and, on that date, the applicant filed its outline of submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">By way of summary of the proceedings, the applicant sought relief in respect of what it claimed was infringement of claims 1, 2, and 4 of the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The respondents contested the infringement case by arguing that the steel beam in the guardliner system was not "mounted on" the barrier element, did not overlie the side walls, and was not on the side walls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondents also contested the liability of the second and third respondents in the principal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondents also cross-claimed against the applicant, asserting that the patent was invalid on the grounds: 
 (a) lack of novelty;
 (b) lack of inventive step;
 (c) not a patentable invention;
 (d) not a manner of manufacture;
 (e) lack of clarity;
 (f) no utility;
 (g) lack of fair basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">

 The ground of fair basis was not pressed at the hearing of the principal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The respondents failed in their defence of the infringement allegation, and they failed on all of the grounds of invalidity pleaded and argued at trial, except for the ground lack of novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The grounds of lack of novelty and inventive step were highly pressed at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">While it is not relevant on the question of costs in the principal proceedings, it is to be noted that an appeal against the judgment pronounced on 11 March 2008 was dismissed with costs by a Full Court of the Federal Court (Sundberg, Emmett and Greenwood JJ) on 31 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The respondents seek an order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of the proceeding to date, including the costs of the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Their submission is based on their assertion that the applicant failed to establish an entitlement to the relief which it sought in the amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant's submission is based on my finding that the respondents failed in the defence of the infringement allegation, and failed on all grounds of invalidity which they asserted, except for lack of novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In those circumstances, the applicant submits, the appropriate order is that the applicant be ordered to pay 40 per cent of the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The question of costs is governed by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which provides: 
 (1) ... the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court (including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction) other than proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">... 

 
 (2) Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

 The general principle as to costs was expressed by Toohey J in Hughes v West Australian Cricket Association Inc &amp; Ors [1986] FCA 382 ; (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748 , at 48,136, where his Honour said: Ordinarily, costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Ritter v Godfrey (1920) 2 KB 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of his claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that he bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he has failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Forster v Farquhar (1893) 1 QB 564.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">A successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other party's costs of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In this sense, 'issue' does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at p 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">As Heerey J noted in ACCC v Nationwide News Pty Ltd; ACCC v Smartcom Telecommunications (1996) ATPR 41-519 at 42,508: 
 That statement of principle [in Hughes ] was approved by the Full Court of this Court in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1988) ATPR 40-841 at 49,077; (1987)17 FCR 211 at 222.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

 
 I would observe that the use of the word "may" by Toohey J makes it clear that he is not suggesting an encroachment on the essentially discretionary nature of a costs order, a conclusion made all the clearer by his Honour's reference to the remarks of Jacobs J in Cretazzo .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 81 ALR 166 at 169 Burchett J had to consider the case of a successful defendant who had failed in respect of some issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">His Honour said: 

 
It does not necessarily follow that the costs orders otherwise appropriate should be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A party against whom an unsustainable claim is prosecuted is not to be forced, at his peril in respect of costs, to abandon every defence he is not sure of maintaining, and oppose to his adversary only the barrier of one hopeful argument: he is entitled to raise his earthworks at every reasonable point along the path of assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">At the same time, if he multiplies issues unreasonably, he may suffer in costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Ultimately, the question is one of discretion and judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Observations by McHugh J in Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 96, [66] --- [70] are directly relevant: By far the most important factor which courts have viewed as guiding the exercise of the costs discretion is the result of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">A successful litigant is generally entitled to an award of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As Devlin J said in Smeaton Hanscomb &amp; Co Ltd v Sassoon I Setty, Son &amp; Co [No 2] [1953] 1 WLR 1481 at 1484; [1953] 2 All ER 1588 at 1590, when setting aside an arbitrator's costs award:
 
 "the arbitrator is not directing his mind to one of the most, if not the most, important of the elements which ought to affect his discretion, namely the result of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Prima facie, a successful party is entitled to his costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">To deprive him of his costs or to require him to pay a part of the costs of the other side is an exceptional measure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">"
 
 
 The combined force of the sentiments recognised above by Mason CJ, regarding the need for consistency in order to avoid injustice, and by Devlin J, regarding the most significant factor affecting the costs discretion, provides the jurisprudential basis for the important principle commonly referred to as the "usual order as to costs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
 The usual order as to costs 

 The expression the "usual order as to costs" embodies the important principle that, subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful party in litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The principle is grounded in reasons of fairness and policy and operates whether the successful party is the plaintiff or the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Costs are not awarded to punish an unsuccessful party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify the successful party [ Latoudis [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 543, per Mason CJ; at 562-563, per Toohey J; at 566-567, per McHugh J; Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14 ; (1994) 179 CLR 403 at 410; per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ].</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">If the litigation had not been brought, or defended, by the unsuccessful party the successful party would not have incurred the expense which it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">As between the parties, fairness dictates that the unsuccessful party typically bears the liability for the costs of the unsuccessful litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">As a matter of policy, one beneficial by-product of this compensatory purpose may well be to instil in a party contemplating commencing, or defending, litigation a sober realisation of the potential financial expense involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Large scale disregard of the principle of the usual order as to costs would inevitably lead to an increase in litigation with an increased, and often unnecessary, burden on the scarce resources of the publicly funded system of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd [1951] 1 All ER 873 at 874, Devlin J formulated the relevant principle as follows:
 
"No doubt, the ordinary rule is that, where a plaintiff has been successful, he ought not to be deprived of his costs, or, at any rate, made to pay the costs of the other side, unless he has been guilty of some sort of misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">"
 
 
 "Misconduct" in this context means misconduct relating to the litigation [ King &amp; Co v Gillard &amp; Co [1905] 2 Ch 7; Donald Campbell &amp; Co Ltd v Pollak [1927] AC 732 at 812], or the circumstances leading up to the litigation [ Bostock v Ramsey Urban District Council [1900] 2 QB 616].</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation [ Jones v McKie [1964] 1 WLR 960; [1964] 2 All ER 842 ; Bostock [1900] 2 QB 616 at 622, 625, 627]; unnecessarily protracts the proceedings [ Forbes v Samuel [1913] 3 KB 706] ; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court [ Armstrong v Boulton [1990] VR 215 at 223]; prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable [ Hobbs v Marlowe [1978] AC 16] ; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute [ Jenkins v Hope [1896] 1 Ch 278].</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">

 Apart from anomalous examples in the equity jurisdiction [These anomalies typically feature a trust fund or property which will readily satisfy benevolent costs orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Such examples were recognised by O 55 of the 1875 Rules which, after stating that costs shall be in the discretion of the Court, declared that "nothing herein contained shall deprive a trustee, mortgagee, or other person of any right to costs out of a particular estate or fund to which he would be entitled according to the rules hitherto acted upon in Courts of Equity"], there are very few, if any, exceptions to the usual order as to costs outside the area of disentitling conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The applicant refers to the observations of the Full Court in Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 where the Full Court recognised that the ordinary rule is that the successful party gets its costs, but: 
 Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 The applicant contends in the present matter that: 
 ... having regard to the time spent and the issues on which the Respondent failed, it is submitted that an award in its favour of 40% of its party/party costs in the proceeding gives adequate recognition of the fact that it succeeded in the overall case, but failed in most of the arguments that it advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

 In my judgment, the usual order as to costs should be made in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The fact that the respondents succeeded on one only of the many grounds of invalidity they asserted is not in my view, in the circumstances of this case, "misconduct" such as to require a departure from the ordinary rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Nor is the respondents' unsuccessful claim of non-infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">As a matter of fact, the respondents' challenge based on lack of novelty was at the forefront of its defence, and, in my assessment, was the central issue joined on the question of validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), on the whole of the material in these proceedings, I order that the applicant pay the respondents costs of and incidental to the proceedings, to be taxed if not agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
