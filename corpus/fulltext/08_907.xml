1 This is an application by the respondents to dismiss the applicant's proceeding as an abuse of the process of the Court or on the ground that the proceeding is vexatious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In the alternative, the respondents seek an order that the applicant provide security for costs in the sum of $20,000 and, in the event of default, the proceeding be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The proceeding was commenced by application on 11 July 2007 accompanied by a Form 167, as required by O 81 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) (the Rules), which provided no other information other than in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The application is said to be brought under ss 5 , 6 , 15 , 29 and 42 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) (DD Act), s 13 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (RD Act), the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (HREOC Act) and the tort of negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicant expressly abandoned the ground under the RD Act at the hearing before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The applicant seeks interlocutory relief in the proceeding which is important for the purpose of disposing of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The interlocutory relief sought is:
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Injunction against bankruptcy proceedings against the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Adjustment of this matter as an offset against bankruptcy proceedings by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 

4 The application was also accompanied by a statement of claim to which is attached a number of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In that statement of claim the applicant asserts that the second respondent breached the terms of the RD Act and the DD Act, and thereby the first respondent has vicariously breached those Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 It is pleaded:
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">About September 2003 the applicant sought with the 1st respondent to change his army record under the old Australian Military Regulation from being "retention of this soldier not in the interest of Australia or the Army" to that of being discharged in "medical or psychiatric incapacity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Further, the applicant also sought under DFRDBA Act 1973 with the 1st respondent a pension on the ground of physical or mental incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The 2nd respondent made decisions on both matters as a delegate of the Chief of Army on 5/4/2005 denying the benefits sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Most of the inferences by HREOC are erroneous of facts and chronology in all of its analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 The applicant claims that the respondents discriminated against the applicant in making the decisions complained of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is pleaded:
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant is seeking relief from this court that the respondents discriminated against him in Commonwealth laws (to change his army record) and programs (to get pension from DFRDB Authority) because he suffers from psychiatric condition and he is Asian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicant's friends who are white have got pension and change of army record even after going awol and will be shown at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 In the alternative, the applicant claims that the respondents owed him a duty of care in respect of the two applications made by the applicant and that they breached those duties of care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The particular duty of care and the circumstances which are said to give rise to its operation are not pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The breach is not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 The respondents have not filed a defence but have brought the application to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The application was supported by an affidavit of Gregory Camilos sworn on 28 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">9 In response to the application the applicant filed a document entitled "Submission to Dismissal Application" and an affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Approximately a week later, the applicant filed a further affidavit in opposition to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The respondents filed two further affidavits sworn by Mr Camilos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 On 15 October 2007 the matter came on before Mansfield J who ordered that the parties file any affidavit evidence in support of and in opposition to the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The parties have complied with that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Justice Mansfield ordered that the motion be heard and determined on the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 On the next day the applicant filed yet another affidavit in which he deposed that Mansfield J "did not give me opportunity for an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I need oral hearing to persuade the motion judge otherwise my chance to persuade him/her is forever gone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">"
 
 12 On 25 January 2008 the applicant filed yet another affidavit, this time exhibiting a medical report of Professor Goldney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On 31 January 2008 the applicant filed yet a further affidavit in which he took issue with the report of Professor Goldney which he had exhibited to his previous affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 On 15 February 2008 the respondents filed a further affidavit sworn by Mr Camilos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The matter came on for hearing before me on 19 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The applicant said that, notwithstanding Mansfield J's order, he wished to be heard orally in opposition to the respondents' notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I acceded to the applicant's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The applicant had already filed written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">14 On 21 February 2008 the respondent filed a further affidavit sworn by Mr Camilos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The applicant filed another affidavit on 25 February 2008 which prompted yet a further affidavit of Mr Camilos sworn on 26 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I have not had regard to the affidavits filed subsequent to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">15 Notwithstanding the plethora of affidavits, the point is a short one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">16 For the reasons which follow, there will be an order dismissing the application as an abuse of the process of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">17 The applicant was a member of the Australian Army between 14 October 1980 and 13 July 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">He was discharged from the Army on that day on the stated ground of his "retention not being in the interests of Australia or the Army".</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">18 He claims that at the time he was discharged he suffered from a psychiatric condition and an ongoing mental incapacity such that he was unable to perform his duties as a soldier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">19 On 14 September 2003 the applicant wrote to the Defence Retirement and Death Benefits Authority (the Authority) seeking an order that pursuant to s 37 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority Act 1973 (Cth) (DFRDBA Act), the Chief of Army inform the Authority that at the time he was retired from the Army, grounds existed to state he could have been retired on the grounds of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">If the Authority had acceded to the applicant's request, the applicant may have been treated as being eligible for a pension from the first respondent on the ground of physical or mental incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">20 On 29 September 2003 the applicant also requested that the first respondent change his Army record pursuant to s 44(2) of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) (this section has since been repealed) from stating "retention of this soldier not in the interest of Australia or the Army" so that he was discharged on the grounds of "medical or psychiatric capacity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">21 On 5 April 2005 the applicant was advised by a delegate of the first respondent, the Director of Personnel of the Army, Brigadier Orme (the second respondent) that both of these requests had not been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Brigadier Orme made a decision that, at the time of the applicant's discharge, grounds did not exist whereby the applicant could have been discharged because of physical or mental incapacity to perform his duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">22 On 28 April 2005 the same delegate, the second respondent, made a further decision not to amend the Army records showing the reason for the applicant's discharge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">23 The applicant sought judicial review of the two decisions made by the second respondent on 5 April and 28 April 2005 which came before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The grounds of the application were referred to in Mansfield J's reasons as being a breach of natural justice due to the non-provision of reports; an improper exercise of power for having taken into account irrelevant considerations; a failure to account for relevant considerations; unreasonableness and that the decision was made in bad faith; that the decision involved an error of law; and, finally, that there was no evidence to justify the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicant did not raise discrimination as a ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">On 14 September 2005 the applicant's application was dismissed by Mansfield J in Rana v Chief of Army [2005] FCA 1283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Mansfield J referred to the claim that the decision was unreasonable and said that there was no material to support the contention that the decision was made in bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">24 On 12 May 2006 an appeal to the Full Federal Court was also dismissed: Rana v Chief of Army Staff [2006] FCAFC 63 ; (2006) 90 ALD 474.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">25 On 30 September 2006 the applicant complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) alleging discrimination on grounds of both race and disability and victimisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">26 On 5 July 2007 the applicant's complaint was terminated by HREOC pursuant to s 46PH(1)(c) of the HREOC Act on the ground that there was "no, or no sufficient, evidence that the A[ustralian] D[efence] F[orce] or Brigadier Orme discriminated against [the applicant] on the ground of disability or race or victimised [the applicant] ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Applicant's submissions 
 
27 The applicant submitted that he had a disability at the time of his discharge in that he had a reactive depression personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He submitted that the second respondent had directly discriminated against him on the grounds of that disability in not accepting that the applicant suffered from a psychiatric disorder at the time of discharge that was a disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">28 The applicant also submitted that even if there was no direct discrimination, he had been indirectly discriminated against because the database had been amended for other soldiers: "in the data base that other soldiers, there were soldiers, who they have been --- just because they have been lazy, the army has offered them out of the army on the medical discharge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">" He further submitted that there was indirect discrimination on the part of the second respondent on the ground that the second respondent introduced "new terms that is not known in law, the terms that [the applicant] could not meet" by stating that the applicant was not disabled at the time of discharge when there was psychiatric evidence showing the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">29 The applicant argued that there had been indirect discrimination because soldiers who were discharged who had been diagnosed with reactive depression "would get all the benefits".</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">He argued that, although he suffered from the same thing, it was determined that he was not entitled to receive anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He relied on literature annexed to his affidavit of 8 October 2007 which showed that adjustment disorder and reactive depression are the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The applicant asserted that the second respondent had written that if there was evidence of any adjustment disorder, that the applicant's record would be changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The applicant contended that it therefore followed that because reactive depression and adjustment disorder are the same, his record should have been changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The applicant submitted that because the second respondent did not come to the conclusion that they were the same, it was the applicant's "inference that he directly or indirectly discriminated against" him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">30 The applicant also submitted that the decisions complained of were illogical and unreasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">31 During argument I put to the applicant that even if the second respondent had made factual errors in arriving at any or even all of the above conclusions, that would not constitute evidence of any discrimination on the grounds of any disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I further put to the applicant that there was no particular plea contained in the current statement of claim of indirect discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">32 The applicant also submitted that he should be entitled to cross-demand or set off the claim he has in this proceeding against his creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">33 The applicant further submitted that his proceeding should not be summarily dismissed as there were "merits in the applicant's causes of actions here below to survive the strike out application by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">" Furthermore, the applicant submitted that the respondents had not proven that the applicant's causes of actions were an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Instead, the applicant contended that it was in fact the respondents' claims that were vague, oppressive, scandalous and caused embarrassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">34 In relation to the claim for security for costs, the applicant referred to Rana v Fsaser Hotel Pty Ltd T/A Hyatt Regency Hotel [2007] FMCA 403 where Cameron FM stated that he was very reluctant to order security for costs against a litigant in person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The applicant contended that this Court should also not make such an order on this occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The applicant filed further written submissions that addressed this same issue and submitted that the respondents had not shown factors relevant for the Court to exercise its discretion and order security for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He contended that the respondents would suffer no hardship if security was not ordered and they sought such an order to "stifle the action" and stated that the respondents falsely considered him a flight risk because he is Asian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Respondent's submissions 
 
35 The respondents contended that this proceeding should be dismissed on two grounds:
 
 
 a. the proceeding is an abuse of process, as it has been brought for an improper purpose (to offset bankruptcy proceeding) and also because of the applicant's general history of litigation; and
 
 b. that the proceeding is vexatious, as this proceeding would have the effect of re-litigating issues already determined against the applicant by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court on a number of other occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 

36 It is necessary to understand the respondents' first contention that this proceeding is an abuse of process issue to give a brief history of the bankruptcy proceeding in which the applicant is currently involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">37 On 15 May 2007 the respondents in this matter caused the applicant to be served with a bankruptcy notice claiming the sum of $7,582.86 which represents the first respondent's party/party costs which the applicant was ordered to pay by Mansfield J on 14 September 2005 in the applicant's failed judicial review proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">On 17 May 2007 the applicant swore an affidavit and made an application disputing the amount and sought an order that the respondent be restrained from proceeding until such time as the appeal in that matter was finalised and until the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) determined whether he was entitled to compensation from the respondent which could then be used to set off the bankruptcy claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">38 On 10 July 2007 the application to have the bankruptcy notice set aside was dismissed by Registrar Christie (with costs to be taxed or agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The applicant sought review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">On 22 April 2008 Simpson FM dismissed that application: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FMCA 518.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Notwithstanding the applicant's application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, the first respondent has filed a creditor's petition which was required to be done within six months from the date of bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">39 The respondents acknowledged that although it is only in the clearest of cases that an application for summary dismissal would succeed: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J, in this case, because the applicant's claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action, it was appropriate for the Court to exercise its power and dismiss the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">40 In support of the abuse of process ground, the respondents contended "that in making his application ... the predominant purpose of the [a]pplicant [was] not to prosecute the proceeding to a conclusion, but instead to use it as a means of obtaining an advantage for which it [was] not designed ...": Metall &amp; Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin [1990] 1 QB 391 at 469.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In particular, the respondents submitted that the purpose of the applicant was to delay and/or frustrate the bankruptcy proceedings against the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">41 The respondents submitted that the applicant was seeking to re-litigate issues already decided such that there was a collateral attack on several Full Court decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The respondents stated that, in effect, the applicant was seeking to re-agitate issues already the subject of a decision and order of the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The respondents submitted that there were no facts currently pleaded in the applicant's statement of claim which would support any conclusion that the second respondent actually unlawfully discriminated against the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">42 In relation to the issue of "offset against bankruptcy proceedings", the respondents submitted that there were no "mutual dealings" between the respondents and the applicants for the purpose of s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (Bankruptcy Act): Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609 , and that the $2,000,000 claimed in damages by the applicant in this matter is neither a debt presently owed to the applicant by the respondents, nor is it a contingent liability arising out of mutual dealings between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The respondents also stated that as there is currently no sequestration order made against the applicant, he is not presently a "person who has become a bankrupt" which means s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act cannot operate in relation to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">43 The respondents argued that the proceeding was vexatious, given the applicant's litigation history in which he has been attempting (unsuccessfully) to establish that, as a result of his service in the Army, he developed a mental disability for which he should be compensated and that this proceeding was yet another attempt by the applicant to re-litigate matters already determined against him on a number of occasions both in this Court and in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">44 The respondents also contended that as there are no particulars in the application or statement of claim (other than bare allegations) as to how the applicant was discriminated against, that the applicant should be ordered to pay security for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They argued that the claim was unmeritorious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The respondents contended that the applicant owns no property and has been unable to pay previous costs orders made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">45 The respondents contended that there was no direct or indirect discrimination or victimisation by the second respondent against the applicant and that his claims therefore had no prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">46 In response to the applicant's submission relying on the decision in Rana v Fsaser Hotel Pty Ltd T/A Hyatt Regency Hotel [2007] FMCA 403 , the respondents contended that in that matter the application for security for costs was premised upon the applicant residing outside the jurisdiction which is not the ground relied on on this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">47 This is not an application under O 11 r 16 of the Rules to strike out a pleading because the pleading has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay of the proceeding, or was otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is an application under O 20 r 5 that the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">48 The power of the Court to dismiss a proceeding summarily is conferred by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (Federal Court Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Court is empowered to give judgment for a respondent to a proceeding if the Court is satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In considering whether a party has a reasonable prospect of success, the Court need not be satisfied that the proceeding is hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">49 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">So much is supported by the Attorney-General's second reading speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth) which was the legislative vehicle which introduced s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He said:
 The bill also strengthens the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters, by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It is appropriate that this provision is of general application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It will be a useful addition to the courts' powers in dealing with any unsustainable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">50 Order 20 rule 5 has to be considered in the light of s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">51 Notwithstanding that the purpose of s 31A was to relax those tests, a Court will still be cautious about finding that an applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">52 Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the respondents have succeeded in establishing that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of prosecuting this proceeding because the proceeding is an abuse of the Court's processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">53 The applicant in these proceedings is seeking to have set aside the decisions made by the second respondent for grounds not advanced in the proceeding before Mansfield J and in the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It is the same decisions as were under attack before Mansfield J and the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Those decisions were found by the Full Court not to have been actuated by any bad faith on the part of the decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">54 Whilst the applicant chose not to argue before the Full Court that the particular of bad faith was discrimination on the ground of his mental illness, nevertheless, the primary judge and the Full Court needed to decide whether or not the decision-maker had reached his decision for any reason of bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The finding has been made and must stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">55 This Court has an implied incidental power to prevent an abuse of its processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The jurisdiction of a superior court to prevent its processes from an abuse of process was considered by the High Court in Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In that case, the High Court was concerned with complaints against three medical practitioners which were laid but not prosecuted in the Medical Tribunal and then re-laid after a Royal Commission had reported adversely on the conduct of the practitioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">On an application to the Court, the Court of Appeal in New South Wales stayed the new complaints on the ground that they were so unfairly and unjustly oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">56 Chief Justice Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 392-393:
 The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Yet again, proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it sought to litigate a newer case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">(Footnotes omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">) 
57 The respondents contended that this Court should find that this proceeding is an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">58 There is no doubt that the issues which are said to arise in this proceeding should have been raised in the proceeding before Mansfield J: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 598; Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCA 422 ; (2004) 146 FCR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">No explanation has been given for the failure to raise these issues in that proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In those circumstances, this proceeding is a manifest abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">59 In Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42 ; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 286, Mason CJ, after remarking that categories of abuse of process remain open, identified three categories within which abuse of process usually falls:
 (1) the court's procedures are invoked for an illegitimate purpose; 
 
 (2) the use of the court's procedures is unjustifiably oppressive to one of the parties; or
 
 (3) the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 

See also Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 226 CLR 256.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">60 Moreover, I am satisfied that this proceeding, as the respondents have contended, has been brought for a collateral purpose and thereby an improper purpose: Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">This proceeding has been brought for the purpose of calling into question Mansfield J's decision and that of the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It has also been brought for the further improper purpose to obtain the interlocutory relief which is sought in the application so as to prevent the first respondent from proceeding with the creditor's petition in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Clearly, in this proceeding, this Court could not make an interlocutory order of the kind sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The Court in which the bankruptcy proceeding has been brought might make such an order but, as the reasons of Simpson FM show, the Federal Magistrates Court has declined to make such an order: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FMCA 518.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">61 In my opinion, therefore, there are two improper purposes identified which underlie the bringing of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">First, the proceeding seeks to bring into question previous decisions of this Court and, secondly, seeks to obtain an order restraining the first respondent from prosecuting proceedings in another court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">62 This proceeding deals with the ultimate issue which Mansfield J was called to decide upon, namely, the validity of the decisions made by the Australian Army.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">If the applicant wished to contend that the decisions were arrived at in contravention of the DD Act, in addition to the other grounds which he advanced before Mansfield J, that was the proceeding in which that argument should have been put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">63 It is an abuse of process, in my opinion, to proceed in the way in which the applicant has.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It could lead to the very unsatisfactory result that, contrary to the decision of Mansfield J, the decisions would be quashed for reasons not considered by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute: Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315.</sentence>
