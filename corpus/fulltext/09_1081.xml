 INTRODUCTION 
 These proceedings relate to an olive plantation managed investment scheme entitled "Australian Olives Project No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">5" (ARSN 103 920 190) ("Project 5" or the "Project").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The first applicant, Huntley Management Limited (ACN 089 240 513) ("HML"), is the current responsible entity of Project 5, being appointed on or about 18 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The other applicants in the proceeding are described in the Amended Statement of Claim (the "ASC") as "investor applicants", each being "an investor in [Project 5]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By a further amended notice of motion filed on 21 August 2009 ("the Motion"), the respondents sought the following orders: Pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act Order 20, Rule 5 and/or Order 6 Rule 9 of the Federal Court Rules , orders that:
 
 
 (a) the claims made in the proceeding by the First Applicant be dismissed; 
 

 
 
 (b) the First Applicant be struck out as a party to the proceeding or cease to be a party; 
 

 
 
 (c) paragraph 4 of the statement of claim be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 2A Further, and alternatively, pursuant to Order 20, Rule 5 of the Federal Court Rules , alternatively the implied jurisdiction of the Court, orders that: 
 

 
 
 (a) in the event that clause 20.4 of the Constitution does not authorise the First Applicant or the Applicants' solicitors to bring and prosecute this proceeding on behalf of the "investor Applicants" (in the absence of express instructions), those solicitors do not have authority or instructions or a retainer from the investor Applicants to bring and prosecute this proceeding and the proceeding is consequently an abuse of process and ought be dismissed, alternatively stayed; 
 

 
 
 (b) alternatively, if clause 20.4 of the Constitution does authorise the First Applicant and the Applicants' solicitors to bring and prosecute this proceeding on behalf of the "investor Applicants", then those solicitors do not have authority or instructions or retainer from some (at least) of the investor Applicants to bring and prosecute this proceeding on their behalf and consequently that part of the proceeding is an abuse of process and ought be dismissed, alternatively stayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 

 As is apparent, there are two parts to the Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">First, it seeks to strike out the claim brought by HML and to remove HML as an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In the notice of motion filed on 18 June 2009 and the amended notice of motion filed 23 June 2009, the respondents relied upon s 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The reference to O 6 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) was added on 21 August 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondents' submissions on the hearing of the Motion focussed primarily on O 6 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) and whether HML had been improperly or unnecessarily joined as a party to a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondents did not submit that the relief would be different if this part of the Motion had been considered as an application under O 20 r 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The second part of the Motion seeks an order that the proceedings brought by the other applicants be dismissed on the basis that the applicants have not authorised solicitors to bring the proceedings on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">That application is made under O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">At the conclusion of the hearing of the Motion, the applicants filed and served a proposed ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The respondents filed submissions in opposition to the proposed amendments and further submissions in relation to the Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These reasons for decision proceed on the basis that the applicants should be given leave to file and serve the ASC and that the orders sought in the Motion relate to that ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In relation to the costs of and incidental to the Motion, I will order that they be costs in the cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">BACKGROUND AND PLEADING - PARTIES AND CLAIMS 
 The first respondent, Australian Olives Limited (ACN 078 885 042) ("AOL"), was the promoter of Project 5 and, until on or about 18 March 2008, was the responsible entity of Project 5: para [2] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The second to seventh respondents were the directors of AOL during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">AOL was replaced by HML as responsible entity for Project 5 as a result of a vote of investors in Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">After HML's appointment as responsible entity, it carried out certain investigations and commissioned reports from Australian Green and Gold Limited ("AGG") in relation to Project 5 and AOL's performance while AOL was responsible entity of Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">HML formed the view that there had been serious breaches by AOL of its obligations to the investors both in its disclosure in the Project 5 prospectus ("the Prospectus") and in its management of Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">HML negotiated and secured a litigation funding agreement with LCM Litigation Fund Pty Ltd, by its subsidiary ALF No 5 Pty Ltd. As a result of the events just described, these proceedings were issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Consistent with authority, I proceed to determine the application on the basis that the assertions of fact in the ASC, taken at their highest, are to be accepted: Lotus Development Corporation v Mayne Nickless Ltd (1991) 100 ALR 167 at 168-169 citing Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The starting point is the Prospectus issued by AOL in relation to Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In the Prospectus, Project 5 was described as involving the establishment of olive groves on a portion of land which had been dedicated to Project 5, known as the "Yallamundi land", located south west of Toowoomba in Queensland and owned by Collective Olive Groves Limited ("COGL"): para [6] and [9] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Project offered investors the opportunity to acquire "Grove Interests", being interests in one of 3,520 olive groves on the "Yallamundi land" with each grove having an area of 0.15 hectare (1,500m 2 ) and planted with 53 olive trees: paras [10] and [11(a) and (b)] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Each investor was required to pay an initial investment sum of $4,433 for each Grove Interest and was required to enter into: a Grove Licence Agreement with COGL, giving the investor a licence to use and occupy a separate and identifiable 0.15 hectare olive grove on the "Yallamundi land"; and a Grove Agreement with AOL, under which AOL would establish and maintain the grove until 30 June 2023.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">(Under the Grove Agreement, AOL undertook to use reasonable endeavours to harvest and market the olive products produced from the investor's grove at the maximum available price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">) 
See paras [11(c), (d) and (e)] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In addition to the initial investment of $4,433, each investor was to pay an annual licence fee to COGL of $33.00 (inclusive of GST) and an annual management fee to AOL of $935.00 (inclusive of GST) in the first year for the ongoing maintenance of the investor's grove: para [11(f)] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In subsequent years, the annual licence fee to AOL was to be indexed annually in accordance with the consumer price index: para [11(f)] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Although AOL undertook to harvest an investor's grove (see [9(2)] above), an investor could elect to conduct its own harvesting and marketing of olives from their allocated grove or groves: para [11(g)] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The trees on the groves were to be "legally" owned by COGL but, for an additional $80, each investor would be entitled to acquire a parcel of 73 ordinary shares in COGL for every Grove Interest held by that investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">AOL offered 256,960 shares in COGL to investors in Project 5: paras [11(j) and (k)] of the ASC, para [11(k)] of the Defence and para [3] of the Reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">After describing the parties, the relevant entities and the contents of the Prospectus, the ASC is divided into the following principal headings: Prospectus representations and promises by AOL: paras [12]-[15]; AOL's Tree Replacement Obligation: para [16]; AOL's contractual obligations under the Grove Agreement: paras [17]-[19]; Grove licence fee: paras [20] and [21]; Take-up of Grove Interests and planting of trees: para [22]; Misleading and deceptive conduct: paras [28]-[45]; 
 
 
 (a) Reliance: para [28];
 (b) Water Representations and Viability Representations misleading: paras [29]-[32];
 (c) AOL misleading conduct --- Corporations Act : paras [33]-[37];
 (d) AOL misleading conduct --- ASIC Act: para [38];
 (e) Loss and damage suffered by investors: para [39];
 (f) Liability of AOL for losses: para [40];
 (g) Director Respondents' liability for losses: paras [41]-[45]; 
 
 
 AOL's breaches of contract and duty: paras [46]-[61A]; 
 
 
 (a) Duties under the Corporations Act and Constitution : paras [46]-[49];
 (b) Breaches of the Compliance Plan and related duties: paras [49A]-[49M];
 (c) Breaches of Grove Agreements: paras [50]-[55A];
 (d) Director Respondents' involvement in contraventions: paras [56]-[57A];
 (e) Director Respondents' contraventions of duties: paras [58]-[61A]; 
 
 
 Death of, and damage to, Scheme trees and charging of excessive fees: paras [62]-[68]; 
 
 
 (a) Breach of Tree Replacement Obligation and Grove Agreements: paras [69]-[70];
 (b) AOL's breaches of duty in respect of management fees: para [71];
 (c) Investors' loss and damage by reason of breaches of Tree Replacement Obligation and duties in relation to management fees: para [72];
 (d) AOL's liability for investors' loss and damage by reason of breaches of Tree Replacement Obligation and duties in relation to management fees: para [73];
 (e) Scheme's loss and damage by reason of breaches of Tree Replacement Obligation and duties in relation to management fees: para [73A];
 (f) Director Respondents' involvement in contraventions: paras [74]-[75A];
 (g) Director Respondents' contravention of duties: paras [76]-[79A].</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 

 As is apparent from those headings, there are two principal groups of claims --- AOL's allegedly misleading and deceptive representations and AOL's alleged breaches of contract and duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">AOL's allegedly misleading and deceptive representations
 The representations were allegedly made to investor applicants prior to them executing the relevant Project 5 agreements (see [9] and [10] above) and making the requisite payment to participate in Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The representations are said to be contained in, or made because of omissions from, the Project 5 Prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The representations are divided into two sub headings --- "the Water Representations" (para [15(c)] of the ASC) and "the Viability Representations" (para [15(d)] of the ASC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The ASC (paras [29]-[38]) alleges that the representations were materially false or misleading, misleading or deceptive and further or alternatively, likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of: ss 728 , 1022A (1), 1041E , 1041F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act "); further or alternatively, s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("the ASIC Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
Ancillary claims are also made against the remaining respondents, defined as the "director respondents": paras [41]-[45] of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">AOL's breaches of contract and duty and ancillary relief against director respondents
 The second group of claims concern the management of Project 5 by AOL as the former responsible entity and include: Claims for breach of the Grove Agreement by AOL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">AOL and each investor were parties to a Grove Agreement under which AOL agreed to establish and maintain the olive groves, including by ensuring that they had adequate irrigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The applicants allege that AOL was in breach of its contractual obligations from the outset because it had not put in place the necessary irrigation infrastructure; Claims that AOL breached its duties as a responsible entity under the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The applicants allege that AOL's duties are similar to fiduciary duties --- to act in the best interests of the members of Project 5, to avoid conflicts of interest, to exercise due diligence and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The applicants allege these duties were breached because AOL preferred it own interests, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to remedy the defaults and terminate Project 5 if it failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The ASC also contends that the director respondents were involved in AOL's contraventions of its responsible entity duties; Claims against the director respondents for breach of their duties under s 601FD of the Corporations Act ; and Claims that AOL was in breach of its contractual and statutory duties by continuing to charge the full amount of the annual management fee even though a good third of the olive trees died and had not been replaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The applicants allege that certain of the director respondents were involved in this breach by AOL of its statutory duties and / or contravened their duties under the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Summary
 The claims in the ASC relate to matters occurring before and after the commencement of Project 5 though, it should be noticed that the earliest complaints relate to the content of the Project 5 Prospectus, and therefore concern a state of affairs at a time when the Prospectus, the Constitution and the form of the Grove Agreement and the form of the Grove Licence Agreement were in existence but the investors were not yet members of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The loss and damage claimed is quantified, in some cases, as the amount contributed by the investors initially and, in other cases, as the amounts paid as ongoing management fees under the Grove Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is however of the first importance to notice that no claim is made by or on behalf of an investor for relief which would bring their participation in Project 5 to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That is, all of the claims, whether made in relation to events before the Project got under way, or subsequent events, are claims made on the premise of their continued membership of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Not only that, the claims that are made in relation to these events (both before the Project got under way and those concerning later events) take the form, in effect, of claims that the amounts contributed by the investors have been lost either to the investors or the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Once these features of the claims are understood, all of the complaints advanced by the respondents will be seen to fall away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">They fall away because, reduced to their essentials, the claims can be seen as ones in which the current responsible entity (HML) and members of the Project claim damages against the former responsible entity (AOL) and its directors for contraventions of statutory prohibitions and contractual obligations which are alleged to have caused loss to either the Project as a whole or its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The fact that the loss is sought to be measured by reference to the particular levels of contributions made by members at various stages in the life of the Project should not be permitted to obscure the essential nature of the claims that are sought to be advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Damages are sought on the footing that money was paid but has been lost to either the Project or to its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Whether those claims are good or bad is of course not a matter I am in a position to, or asked to, make any judgment about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It is enough to say that I am not persuaded that the claims as framed in the ASC are unarguably bad and I am not persuaded that HML has been improperly and unnecessarily joined as a party to these proceedings or that these proceedings are brought in the names of the individual members without authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">ROLE OF HML AS THE RESPONSIBLE ENTITY --- THE ASC, THE CORPORATIONS ACT AND THE SCHEME DOCUMENTS 
 Project 5 was and continues to be a registered management investment scheme: Ch 5C of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">As the responsible entity of Project 5, HML is obliged to exercise its statutory and other obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">So, for example, HML must "operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the scheme's constitution and [the Corporations] Act": s 601FB of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Section 601FC prescribes HML's statutory duties and powers and the manner in which they are to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Those powers and duties include, by way of example: to act in the best interests of the members: s 601FC(1)(c) ; to comply with the Project's compliance plan: s 601FC(1)(h) ; to ensure that all payments out of the Project Property are made in accordance with the Project's constitution and the Corporations Act : s 601FC(1)(k) ; to carry out or comply with any other duty, not inconsistent with the Corporations Act , that is conferred on the responsible entity by the scheme's Constitution: s 601FC(1)(m).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Consistent with s 601FC of the Corporations Act , the Constitution of Project 5 dated 28 February 2003 (between, and binding on, the investors and the responsible entity) contains extensive provisions about the legal obligations of the parties and the rights and powers of each party: cl 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">A number of other provisions of the Constitution should be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Clause 20.2 of the Constitution provides: 
 
 
 In addition to all other powers conferred on the Responsible Entity by this Constitution and the [Corporations] Act, the Responsible Entity has the power to do any act or thing , which, in the Responsible Entity's opinion, is necessary for the proper and efficient establishment, management and development of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 

 
 
 
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">) 
 
 

 
"Project" is defined in the Constitution (in Sch 1) as the managed investment scheme established by the Constitution (defined previously as Project 5 --- see [1] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In addition, the responsible entity covenants with the members to act in accordance with the Grove Licence Agreements and the Grove Agreements (cl 20.5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Secondly, consistent with s 601FC(2) of the Corporations Act , the Constitution provides "Project Property" is held by the responsible entity on trust for the members for the term of Project 5: cl 3.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The term "Project Property" is defined in Sch 1 to mean: 
 
 
 The Funds, all Investments, assets and any other property acquired throughout the term of the Project using the money or property contributed by Members, but excluding any assets or any other property vested in the Members ... 
 
 

 
The definition acknowledges that there will be "Project Property" (or scheme property) as well as other property connected with the scheme which is not "scheme property": see Treecorp Australia Ltd (in liq) v Dwyer [2009] FCA 278 ; (2009) 175 FCR 373 at [43] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Clause 3.3 of the Constitution provides that: 
 
 
 The law applying to trustees and trusts at common law does not apply to the Responsible Entity, except as expressly referred to in this Constitution or the [Corporations] Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 

 Thirdly, cl 7.3(a) of the Constitution provides that: 
 
 
 Despite anything else in this Constitution , the Responsible Entity is not entitled to any fees, recovery of costs or indemnity from Project Property in circumstances where the Responsible Entity has not properly performed its role under the Constitution or the [Corporations] Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 

 As a result, the responsible entity must not pay any money from the "Funds" contributed by investors (defined in the Constitution as the "Application Fund and Proceeds Fund") unless authorised by the Constitution , the Corporations Act or where the payment is in respect of identified types of payments: cl 20.1 of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Further, cl 8.1 provides that the responsible entity has a right of indemnity out of the Funds and the Project Property in respect of any liability incurred by the responsible entity in the performance of its duties as the responsible entity and all fees payable to the responsible entity under the Constitution except where there has been negligence, deceit, breach of duty, fraud or breach of trust by the responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Moreover, cl 8.6 provides that nothing in the Constitution limits the liability of the responsible entity for negligence, deceit, breach of duty or breach of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Next, cl 20.4 of the Constitution provides that: 
 
 
 The Responsible Entity may on its own behalf or on behalf of any Applicant or Member commence and prosecute legal proceedings of any kind in any court in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 

 "Interest" is defined in Sch 1 of the Constitution as: 
 
 
 The interest in the Project a Member acquires by applying under the Prospectus and having the Application accepted by the Responsible Entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">An Interest includes a Member's participation in a Grove Licence Agreement and a Grove Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">... 
 
 

 
 
 
 An Interest also includes --- 
 
 

 
 
 
 (a) the Member's business in carrying on the primary production enterprise of planting, maintaining, harvesting and selling the produce from the Grove; and 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) the net proceeds which result from the Member carrying on its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 

 In this context, s 601MA of the Corporations Act is also relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It provides that: 
 
 
 (1) A member of a registered scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct of the scheme's responsible entity that contravenes a provision of this Chapter may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the responsible entity whether or not the responsible entity has been convicted of an offence, or has had a civil penalty order made against it, in respect of the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 

 
 
 
 (2) An action under subsection (1) must be begun within 6 years after the cause of action arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 

 
 
 
 (3) This section does not affect any liability that a person has under other provisions of this Act or under other laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 

 RESPONDENTS' ARGUMENTS AND ANALYSIS 
 As noted earlier, the respondents make two complaints --- that HML should not be party to the proceedings and, secondly, the investor applicants have not authorised the solicitors to institute proceedings on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Removal of HML as a party
 The respondents' contend that notwithstanding the subject matter of the two groups of claims (see [6]-[18] above), HML should be removed as a party to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They dealt with each group of claims separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Breach of contract and duty claims
 In relation to the second group of claims --- for breach of contract and duty --- the respondents addressed their complaint in the following terms: 
 
 
 [HML] contends that it can bring the proceeding in the capacity of trustee of the "scheme property" of the scheme: see paragraph 4(b)(ii) of the [ASC].</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Thus, pleadings have now been introduced alleging that causes of action against director Respondents, and the former Responsible Entity [AOL], concerning breaches of the Grove Agreements and duties imposed under s 601FC of the [Corporations Act] are causes of action that can be brought by the new Responsible Entity [HML] against the former Responsible Entity and the director respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Yet claims remain that the investor applicants also bring such causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 

 
 
 
 In each case the loss and damage claimed consists of the recovery of contributions made by members to the scheme, management fees and licence fees: see paragraphs 49F, 49M, 55A, 57A, 61A, 73A, 75A and 79A of the [ASC].</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">
 
 

 
 
 
 The fallacy is that these alleged losses can be described as "scheme losses": see the heading immediately prior to paragraph 73A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">In truth the losses claimed are those of individual investor applicants (or members) and not those of the scheme itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">
 
 

 As the respondents acknowledge, this group of claims is pleaded against the respondents in two ways --- by HML as responsible entity and by the applicants as individual investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The respondents make two complaints --- that the investor applicants bring the same claims as HML and HML is not a proper party, and secondly, that the applicants' particulars of loss and damage show that the loss allegedly suffered was loss by the investors, not the scheme itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">HML is described in para [4] of the ASC in the following terms: 
 
 
 The First Applicant, [HML]: 
 
 

 
 
 
 (a) was appointed to replace AOL as the Responsible Entity of the Scheme on 18 March 2008; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) is: 
 
 

 
 
 
 (i) empowered, pursuant to clause 20.4 of the Constitution for the Scheme, to initiate and conduct this proceeding on behalf of the other applicants in its capacity as the responsible entity for the Scheme; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (ii) further or alternatively, entitled to bring this proceeding in its capacity as trustee of the scheme property of the Scheme ("the Scheme Property").</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 
 

 As that paragraph of the ASC pleads, HML is now the responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The respondents focus on the last sub-paragraph (para (b)(ii)) as providing the only basis for HML to institute proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">That is not accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It is not the only capacity in which HML can and does bring the second group of claims in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">As noted earlier, the Corporations Act and the Constitution , read together, provide that HML as the responsible entity has certain duties and powers: see [19]-[29] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In the present context, those provisions of the Corporations Act and the Constitution expressly empower HML, amongst other things: to " operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the Scheme's Constitution and [the Corporations Act ] ": s 601FB of the Corporations Act ; in addition to all other powers conferred on HML by the Constitution and the Corporations Act , to do any act or thing , which, in HML's opinion, is necessary for the proper and efficient establishment, management and development of the Project : cl 20.2 of the Constitution ; and on its own behalf or on behalf of any applicant or member, to commence and prosecute legal proceedings of any kind in any court in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest: cl 20.4 of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
As noted at [22] above, the "Project" is the managed investment scheme established by the Constitution (being Project 5 --- see [1] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The definition of "Interest" is set out in [28] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Project 5 remains registered as a managed investment scheme governed by the Corporations Act , the Constitution , the Grove Licence Agreement and the Grove Agreement: see [19]-[28] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The entity which is obliged to operate it is HML.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">However, HML was appointed as the responsible entity in March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">From the time of their appointment, HML allegedly faced difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">HML reported to investors as early as 10 April 2008 that there were no project funds to operate Project 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Notwithstanding that fact, HML gave approval for the harvesting of the olives and had its responsible manager inspect the Project's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In a letter to investors dated 27 May 2008 (which enclosed a copy of the report prepared by AGG (see [7] above)), HML stated, in part, that: 
 
 
 Please find enclosed a copy of a report from our Responsible Manager dated 24 April 2008 following his inspection of the Project property on 23 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The report covers ... Project 5 ... and highlights the number of dead and commercially unviable trees on your Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Clearly this situation is disgraceful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 
 

 
 
 
 The future of your Project remains uncertain and largely depends upon a successful claim against ... [AOL].</sentence>

 By August, HML's investigations had progressed.</sentence>

 These proceedings were filed on 18 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The Project is said to be short of funds and at least one of the sources being explored by HML to secure funds is action against AOL, as the former responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Whether that action is being commenced by HML under s 601FB of the Corporations Act (read in the context of the other provisions including s 601FC) or cl 20 of the Constitution or both is not an issue I need to resolve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that HML had the power to commence the proceedings to seek to recover the loss and damage caused by the alleged breaches of contract and duty pleaded in the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">That then brings me to the question of loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The respondents submitted that the applicants' allegation that HML, as the new responsible entity, "brings action to recover loss" was "misconceived, and contrary to the whole thrust of the claim which is one brought to recover loss to individual investors, and not loss caused to the scheme as such".</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There are, in my view, two answers to these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">First, as set out above (see [29]), s 601MA of the Corporations Act provides that a member of a registered scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct of the scheme's responsible entity that contravenes a provision of Ch 5C of the Corporations Act may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Section 601MA is to be understood in its context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Section 601MA was one of the core provisions inserted in Ch 5C to implement and "preserve the concept of a single responsible entity responsible to members for the operation of a scheme": Explanatory Memorandum, Managed Investments Bill 1997 (Cth), Ch 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It ensures that the "liability for any loss of investors' funds, through negligent or illegal activity, rests entirely with the responsible entity": Second Reading Speech, Managed Investments Bill 1997 (Cth), House of Representatives (1997) Vol 218, p 11928.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">However, in a 2003 industry report entitled Managed Investment Schemes: an Industry Report, G Moodie and Prof I Ramsay from the Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation at The University of Melbourne, considered the policy assumptions that had in their view been made in Ch 5C of the Corporations Act in dealing with "investor rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Section 601MA was the prime example used by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The authors said (at 74-75): 
 
 
 The grant of a direct cause of action to scheme members is premised on a number of flaws relating to both [Ch 5C of the Corporations Act ] and how it operates in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The primary flaw is that there is no means by which scheme members can become aware that the [responsible entity] has 'contravened a provision of this Chapter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Neither the board nor the compliance committee of the [responsible entity] is under an obligation to report or disclose contraventions (material or otherwise) to scheme members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">... 
 
 

 
 
 
 The second flaw is that it assumes that scheme investors will have sufficient resources and inclination to bring a civil recovery action against the [responsible entity].</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In relation to non-institutional scheme members, this is unrealistic given that in Australia civil proceedings, costs follow the event and thus the risk of an unsuccessful action is likely to be prohibitive to implementing proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">... 
 
 

 It must be remembered that the Corporations Act expressly provides that a responsible entity must "operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the scheme's constitution and [the Corporations] Act ": s 601FB(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In that context, cl 20 of the Constitution for Project 5 is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Clause 20.4 provided that HML could "on its own behalf or on behalf of any Applicant or Member commence and prosecute legal proceedings of any kind in any court in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Clause 20.4 provides that the proceedings commenced by HML "may be of any kind" and "in any court".</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">There are, however, some limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The proceedings must be commenced on HML's own behalf or on behalf of any applicant or member .</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That limitation recognises that HML may institute proceedings on behalf of a group of people who have applied for interests but not yet been accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Next, the proceedings commenced on its own behalf or on behalf of any applicant or member must be "in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">"Project" is defined in the Constitution (in Sch 1) as the managed investment scheme established by the Constitution (see [22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">"Interest" is defined in Sch 1 of the Constitution as the interest in the Project a member acquires by applying under the Prospectus and having the application accepted by the responsible entity and also includes a member's participation in a Grove Licence Agreement and a Grove Agreement, the member's business in carrying on the primary production enterprise of planting, maintaining, harvesting and selling the produce from the grove and the net proceeds which result from the member carrying on its business (see [28] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Such a broad provision is not surprising: see eg Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 511.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Clause 20.4 enables a responsible entity in the position of HML to deal not only with the problems and issues identified by Moodie and Prof Ramsay (see [46] above) but also the fact that Ch 5C of the Corporations Act recognises that the statutory right of action under s 601MA against the responsible entity for loss and damage suffered as a result of a contravention of Ch 5C does not extend to actions against or facilitate accountability to scheme members for loss or damage suffered as a result of contraventions of Ch 5C by parties other than the responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The possibility of action against others depends on the general law and ss 1324 and 1325 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 20 permits a responsible entity to address these kinds of claims thereby minimising, if not removing, the number, complexity and expense of multiple proceedings raising the same or similar issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Of course, if members with at least 5% of the votes in a scheme are unhappy with the actions of HML, they have a statutory course open to them under s 601FM --- call a members' meeting to consider and vote on a resolution that HML be removed as the responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">For those reasons, I consider that Ch 5C of the Corporations Act read with the Constitution (including cl 20), was intended to, and does, empower HML to institute proceedings alleging claims for breach of contract and duty by a former responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Put another way, there is nothing in the express words of cl 20.4 either alone or read in conjunction with the other provisions of the Constitution or the Corporations Act which support the respondents' contention that cl 20.4 only authorises certain kinds of action against certain kinds of defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">For example, the respondents submitted that cl 20.4 only authorised the bringing of actions relating to the management of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">For the reasons stated at paras [45]-[47], I reject that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">However, even if that was the correct or preferable construction of cl 20.4 (which I do not accept), in the circumstances which presently exist in relation to Project 5, it cannot be said that these proceedings do not relate to the management of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">As HML reported to investors, it is "operating" the Project but the course of management adopted by HML is dependent, at least in part, on the outcome of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">In my view, HML has not been improperly and unnecessarily joined as a party to these proceedings in relation to the second group of claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">AOL's misleading and deceptive representations
 The first group of claims of this kind concern the alleged misrepresentations by AOL summarised in para [14] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The respondents contend that despite the provisions of the Corporations Act and the Project's Constitution (see [19]-[29] above), HML is improperly and unnecessarily joined as a party to the proceeding in relation to these claims: O 6 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I reject that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Part 5C.2 of the Corporations Act provides the legislative framework for the responsible entity of a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">But, as we have seen, the Corporations Act cannot be read in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The responsible entity must operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the Project's Constitution and the Corporations Act : s 601FB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">For that reason alone, HML is a proper party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It is, on any view, a person with sufficient connection to the controversy: see Edge; Re Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd (in liq) (2007) 61 ACSR 139 at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It is responsible entity of a managed investment scheme in which the members of the scheme raise serious allegations about what was contained in, and omitted from, the Project's Prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Moreover, the representations made by AOL which are the subject of complaint were made at a time when the Constitution existed and that Constitution and the Corporations Act bound AOL (as responsible entity) to exercise its powers and functions in particular ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The allegation is that AOL did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Thirdly, cl 20.2 permits HML to do any act or thing , which, in HML's opinion, is necessary for the proper and efficient establishment, management and development of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">As with the second group of claims, the substance of the unchallenged evidence from HML was that there were no project funds to operate the Project, HML had paid for the cost of the 2008 harvest itself and that the issue of proceedings was a way the members "would be able to get some of their investment money back".</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">It is therefore unsurprising that at least one of the options explored, and then taken, by HML as the responsible entity was to seek to recover investment funds paid to AOL by the members in circumstances where the contents of the Prospectus were allegedly misleading and deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It might provide a source of funds to enable the members to seek "to generate a commercial return" from the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Fourthly, cl 20.4 of the Constitution authorised HML, on its own behalf or on behalf of any applicant or member, to commence and prosecute this aspect of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">As noted earlier (see [45]-[50]), the language of the clause is broad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In light of the legislative scheme of Ch 5C of the Corporations Act and the definition of both "Project" and "Interest", it is not possible to conclude that the Prospectus and its contents is not a matter "in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In fact, without the Prospectus and its contents, there would be no Project and no Member's Interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">These matters are important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Perhaps, standing alone, they are decisive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">However, the points made earlier (see [16]-[18]) are conclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">HML has not been improperly and unnecessarily joined as a party to these proceedings in relation to this group of claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Applicants not authorised solicitors to bring proceeding 
 In light of the views earlier expressed, it is not necessary for me to finally determine this part of the Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">However, if the matter should proceed further, it might be of assistance if I set out in summary form why this aspect of the Motion would in my view also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">First, cl 20.4 of the Constitution was binding on all investors under s 601GB of the Corporations Act , a fact which was set out in the Project 5 Prospectus on at least 2 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Secondly, at the time of applying for an interest in the Project, each investor acknowledged in writing that he or she agreed to be bound by the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Thirdly, there is no suggestion that the authority conferred on HML by cl 20.4 has not been exercised in good faith or not in the interests of the members: cf Distillers Co Bio-Chemicals (Australia) Pty Ltd v Ajax Insurance Co Ltd [1974] HCA 3 ; (1974) 130 CLR 1 at 8, 9 (per Menzies J) and 23 (per Stephen J) and s 601FC of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Fourthly, even if cl 20.4 of the Constitution did not authorise HML to commence the proceedings (a submission I reject), each investor was sent a pro forma letter and asked to select one of the following options: I support the Court action and confirm the authorisation given to Huntley Management Ltd (HML) in clause 20.4 of the Constitution for HML to bring the Court proceedings and to instruct DMAW Lawyers for and on behalf of me and in my name provided that this is at no cost to me except if there are any recoveries from the Court action and then only from those recoveries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">I oppose the Court action and wish to be removed as a named Applicant in the Court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">I confirm that I fully understand that if I select this option then in the event the Court action is successful and monies are recovered, I will not be entitled to any part of any monies recovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">I am unsure of my position in regard to the Court action and I would like further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Option 1 was supported by 55.81% of investors and 67.73% of Grove Interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Even if cl 20.4 of itself was insufficient authorisation (a view I do not hold), I accept that by selecting Option 1, that investor ratified HML's actions in commencing these proceedings on their behalf: Presentaciones Musicales SA v Secunda [1994] Ch 271 at 277 per Dillon LJ (Nolan LJ agreeing) and at 284-285 per Roch LJ; Walsh v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd (1996) 21 ACSR 213 at 217.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Eight investors (6.20% of total investors) sought to be removed as a party to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">HML has informed the Court that they will be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">It is worth noting that one of the eight has already settled with AOL on a confidential basis and another is a company owned by the sixth respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The balance of the investors did not respond or had ticked option three.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">At the time of the hearing of the Motion, in relation to the third group, the applicants' solicitors were liaising with or following up each of those investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">After the hearing, the applicants' solicitors informed the respondents and the Court that as at 14 September 2009: 90 Project 5 investors had returned the pro forma letter indicating support for the action brought by HML; 11 Project 5 investors had sought to be excluded as investor applicants and had been removed; of the remaining Project 5 investors: 
(a) 11 had verbally conveyed their support for the proceedings and expressed an intention to return the pro forma letter confirming their support;
 
(b) 8 had requested further time to consider their position; and
 
(c) 10 were yet to respond despite attempts to contact them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">I have no reason to doubt that the remaining 18 Project 5 investors will be dealt with in an appropriate manner and without delay and that the Court will be kept properly informed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">If circumstances should change, I would expect HML to inform the Court of such matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">For those reasons, it is not demonstrated that the proceedings are an abuse of process within the meaning of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">ORDERS 
 I will now grant leave for the applicants to file and serve the ASC and order that they pay the respondents' costs thrown away be reason of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss the Motion and order that the costs of and incidental to the Motion be costs in the cause.</sentence>
