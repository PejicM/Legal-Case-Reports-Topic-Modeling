<sentence id="s0">
 
1 I gave reasons for judgment in these matters on 26 June 2007: see King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I ordered the parties to submit a draft determination and related orders within 6 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Both the applicants and the Northern Territory submitted final draft determinations, with the Pastoral respondents primarily in agreement with the draft submitted by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The final draft determinations left a number of issues to be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The following indicates, in a summary way, how these issues should be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The final determination is Annexure 1 to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Unless I indicate otherwise, the reference to a clause is to the clause in the final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">References to "the reasons" are to the reasons given on 26 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 First, there is an issue in relation to liberty to apply concerning structures (Order 5(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There is no evidence that structures were not constructed lawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Indeed, there is probably a legal presumption that they would have been constructed lawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The liberty to apply should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The second issue concerns the garbage reserve (clauses 11 and 12 of the applicants' draft determination and consequential references).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I did not intend, by my reasons, to indicate that only certain native title rights and interests were extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The examples given in those reasons were illustrative only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">My conclusion is reflected in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 It is not clear whether there is a residual issue about clause 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">At one point the applicants contended that the word "confer" should be included in that clause though the matter was not pursued in submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The inclusion of the word appears to me to be unnecessary and potentially misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The clause should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">5 It is not clear whether there is a residual issue about clause 11(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">At one point the applicants appeared to suggest there should not be reference to lot 1 of the Township.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There should be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The clause should be in the terms proposed by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">6 There is an issue at about how clause 12, the relationship clause, should be expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Clause 8 declares the native title rights and interests in exclusive areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Clause 12, concerns the relationship between rights and interests in the non-exclusive areas and other rights and interests in those areas (being the other rights and interests identified in clause 11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Northern Territory contends that clause 12 should make reference to clause 8 which concerns native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicants resist this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">There is also an issue about whether the words "but did not extinguish" should be included in this clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Pastoralists oppose their inclusion but, if included, should be qualified by the words "except in accordance with law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">7 As to this second issue, it is a new issue of potentially some significance which should have been raised during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">No relevant concession was made by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I accept the submission of the applicants that the vast preponderance of determinations included the contentious formulation ("but did not extinguish") which appears also to be conformable with s 44H(c) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I am not persuaded it is clearly inappropriate for the words to be included nor am I persuaded that the qualification proposed by the Pastoralists is plainly necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Had the Pastoralists sought to agitate this issue at the hearing, it could have first been addressed by the parties and then in a reasoned judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Unless it is obvious that the qualification is necessary (and it is not obvious) or it is agreed, it should not be included as a part of the process of settling the form of the determination
 
8 As to the first issue (reference in clause 12 to clause 8), it is again a new issue of potentially some significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The exclusive areas to which clause 8 relates are identified in schedule C, item 1(a) which are certain areas in the Town of Newcastle Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The interests in clause 11 include interests arising from the various pastoral leases, interests in relation to stock routes and miscellaneous interests including "the right of access by an employee, servant, agent or instrumentality of the Northern Territory or Commonwealth, or other statutory authority, as required in the performance of statutory duties" (clause 11(j)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As a matter of fact, it is highly probable, at the least, that many of these rights and interests (for example those of the pastoral leaseholders) would not and probably could not be exercised in relation to the exclusive areas (the areas in the Township identified in schedule C, item 1(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However the applicants accept that the rights identified in clause 11(j) can be exercised in the face of the native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It appears to me that this concession warrants the inclusion of a reference to clause 8 in clause 12 without determining whether it is necessary as a matter of law and notwithstanding, as just mentioned, most of the rights and interests identified in clause 11 probably have no legal or practical relevance to the exercise of the native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9 The remaining issues concern schedule D. There is an issue about the description of the lots in the Town of Newcastle Waters in that schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Northern Territory proposes that the lots where native title rights and interests have been wholly extinguished simply be described by their lot numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The applicants suggests that in relation to certain lots the additional words "in respect of which there are being grants of freehold or leasehold estates" be added and, in relation to other lots, the words "in respect of which public works have been constructed or established".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The applicants' suggestion appears to me to be unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Schedule D is simply a description of areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">They are sufficiently described by identifying the lots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">My earlier reasons for judgment reveal why native title rights and interests have been wholly extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">10 Also in relation to schedule D, there is an issue about how the homestead and related buildings and structures should be described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The applicants propose "a homestead house, shed and buildings".</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The competing formulation is "the homestead complex".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In view of the inclusion of the expression "any adjacent land", the formulation of the applicants is to be preferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">11 Again in relation to schedule D, there is an issue at about how the homestead and highway airstrips should be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">For greater precision, it is appropriate to include the words "on NT portion 2093".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">12 Again in relation to schedule D, there is an issue at about whether reference should be made to "any constructed yard airstrips" and "any constructed roads".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As discussed in my reasons for judgment, the evidence did not establish the existence of improvements of this type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It would potentially be misleading to refer them in schedule D and they should not be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">13 Again in relation to schedule D, it appears to be suggested that the expression "exclusive use of which is necessary" in item 4 is inapt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I dealt with this at [165] of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The applicants' formulation reflects those reasons and should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
