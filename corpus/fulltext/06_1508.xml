1 The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which, on 13 December 2005, affirmed the decision of the respondent not to provide the applicant compensation for permanent impairment under s 24 of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ("SRC Act") as sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application for an extension of time was filed on 2 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">An appeal may be brought under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The respondent opposes the application for extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The applicant enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy in 1983.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In about February 1984, he suffered lacerations to his right shin which became infected and, in April of that year, he developed cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He was discharged from the Navy on 9 July 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 In 2002, the applicant lodged an application (dated 27 July 2002) seeking a benefit under the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He identified his injury or illness as "cellulitis - recurrent infection".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He did not specify the benefits he was claiming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">A further application was lodged on 4 April 2003 through the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The injury or illness was identified as "cellulitis" and the benefits sought were permanent impairment lump sum and medical expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 On 14 June 2003, a delegate of the respondent made a determination regarding liability but not benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The determination was expressed in terms of the applicant having "suffered a contraction of disease which your military service was contributing factor, namely cellulitis in the right leg associated with septicaemia ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The delegate went on to determine "that for the purposes of the [SRC] Act the date of injury is 18 April 1984 as this is the date that you first sought medical treatment for the claimed condition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 8 December 2003, a delegate determined that the applicant suffered a 10 per cent loss of function of his right leg below the knee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Compensation was awarded under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth), which was the Act in force at the time the applicant's leg was injured and he developed cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That determination was affirmed on 16 March 2004 in response to a request for reconsideration received from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 On 30 April 2004, the applicant sought review by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The applicant contended that his degree of permanent impairment should have been assessed under the SRC Act and not the 1971 Act, either because the condition did not become permanent until after the 1988 Act came into force, or because the relevant impairment was a new impairment occurring after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 13 December 2005, the Tribunal gave ex tempore reasons for decision affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Briefly stated, it held that the applicant's condition was not compensable under the SRC Act since the relevant condition was still the 1984 impairment and there had been no change in the underlying patho physiology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal also held that even if it had accepted that the applicant had suffered a new impairment after the commencement date, the applicable table under the Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment ("the Guide") was Table 13.1 which deals with intermittent conditions, and not Table 1.3 (cardio-vascular system) or Table 4.1 (skin disorders).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Guide is prepared by Comcare and approved by the Minister under s 28 of the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">6 In its decision the Tribunal recounted that the applicant suffered an injury in 1984 and the events that followed:
 
 There is no dispute that as a result of an injury occasioned to the Applicant in 1984 when he was serving as a member of the Royal Australian Navy that he then got the condition of cellulitis in his right leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It would appear however that after a period at a naval medical establishment the cellulitis resolved and in the period from 1984 to 1998 the Applicant was not troubled at all by any cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There are some photos as exhibits which simply show that there was a small residual scar on the Applicant's right leg but that is all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 However, in 1998 symptoms suddenly occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As he said he woke up one morning at home, felt as if he had a fever and his leg was black.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He was taken to Tamworth Base Hospital and the diagnosis of cellulitis made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">There was also a high blood sugar reading noted but this was not followed up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 

7 The Tribunal noted that there were no problems again until 1999 when the applicant had a further attack of cellulitis and again was admitted to hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He was then diagnosed as having non-insulin dependent diabetes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It observed that the applicant has had attacks of cellulitis every six to eight weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">While antibiotics cure the condition, the applicant is immobilised for some three to four days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 The Tribunal then said:
 
 There is dispute in the evidence as to the interplay of the original injury and also the diabetes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">We accept the opinions of Professor Lord and Dr Butler that as a result of the injury in 1984 there were underlying lymphatic problems with the potential for infection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Now this condition existed since 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As a result of this diabetes the applicant is now more prone to infection and hence the cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As put by Dr Butler, the current cellulitis is caused by a combination of diabetes and pre-existing cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">That cellulitis is not a new condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">That is to say, the pathology of infection has remained unaltered since 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Perhaps it was put rather strikingly in one way by Dr Butler that the original injury loaded the gun and diabetes pulled the trigger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">So that is to say, the current cellulitis was as stated a result of two factors, the existing cellulitis in the diabetes with the latter condition, according to both Professor Lord and Dr Butler, enlarging the likelihood of the infective process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 The underlying pathology of cellulitis has however not changed but just the patho-physiological environment in which the infective process is occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">That is to say cellulitis is the same condition as has existed since 1984 and in line with Comcare v Maida (2002) 36 AAR 69, there has been no change in the underlying patho physiology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In any event even if we were to find that there had been a new impairment, we are satisfied that the applicable table under the guide to the assessment of the degree of permanent impairment is table 13.1 which refers to intermittent conditions ... 
 
 The net result is however that as stated, it is still the 1984 condition and impairment and the decision under review is affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 

9 An extension of time is required because the applicant did not file a notice of appeal from the Tribunal decision within 28 days of receiving the written reasons of the Tribunal: s 44(2A)(a) of the AAT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">10 The respondent resists the application for an extension of time on two bases only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The first is that the appeal has no merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The second is that the proceedings are futile because even if the applicant were to succeed in the appeal, he would not be eligible to receive compensation under s 24 of the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">This was said to be so for two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The first was that the applicant has not disputed the Tribunal's finding that the appropriate Table in Guide was Table 13.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The second was that on the evidence the applicant presented to the Tribunal, the applicant does not meet the requirements prescribed in Table 13.1 for the minimum permanent impairment of 10%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">11 The explanation for the delay concerns the time it took for the applicant and the applicant's solicitors to become aware of the Tribunal's decision, obtain pro bono advice from counsel and to complete and file all necessary documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It is unnecessary to detail the evidence as the respondent does not challenge the explanation or raise it as a basis for resisting the extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is sufficient to move to the question of whether the appeal has merit or whether it is futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">12 The relevant provisions of the SRC Act , then known as the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth), commenced on 1 December 1988, when the 1971 Act was repealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Section 24 of the SRC Act provides for payment of compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Section 4 of the SRC Act defines impairment as "the loss, the loss of the use, or the damage or malfunction, of any part of the body or of any bodily system or function or part of such system or function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">" The term "permanent" is defined under s 4 as "likely to continue indefinitely".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">13 Under s 124(1) of the SRC Act , the Act applies to injuries, loss and damage suffered before it commenced and, subject to certain qualifications, compensation may be made under the SRC Act notwithstanding that the relevant injury occurred before its enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">One qualification is found in s 124(3) which concerns circumstances where either compensation of a lump sum was paid under earlier legislation or there was no entitlement to compensation of a lump sum under that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In other circumstances s 124(4) limits the amount of compensation payable under s 24 , relevantly, to the amount that would have been payable under the 1971 Act if the permanent impairment occurred before the day Part X the SRC Act came into force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Subsection 124(4) provides:
 
 (4) The amount of compensation (if any) that a person is, by virtue of this section, entitled to receive under section 24 or 25 in respect of a permanent impairment, or under section 17 in respect of the death of an employee, being an impairment or death that occurred before the commencing day, shall be the same as the amount of the compensation that would have been payable to that person, if this Act had not been enacted, under: 
 (a) where the impairment or death occurred before the commencement of the 1930 Act--the 1912 Act; 
 (b) where the impairment or death occurred after the commencement of the 1930 Act but before the commencement of the 1971 Act--the 1930 Act as in force when the impairment or death occurred; or 
 (c) in any other case--the 1971 Act as in force when the impairment or death occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">

14 The first and second grounds in the applicant's notice of appeal relate to the Tribunal's construction of s 124 of the SRC Act and its determination that the applicant had not suffered a change in his patho physiological condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The applicant's submissions were as follows:

 
(i) The Tribunal, having accepted that the applicant did not suffer any symptoms from 1984 to 1998, failed to determine whether he suffered an impairment under s 4 of the SRC Act during this time;
 
(ii) The Tribunal, despite having accepted that he was asymptomatic from 1984 to 1988 and did not have a gradual worsening during that time, found that the applicant did not have a new impairment and was therefore not entitled to compensation under the SRC Act ;
 
(iii) The Tribunal erred in law by incorrectly applying the principles in Department of Defence v West (1998) 85 FCR 491 and Comcare Australia (Department of Defence) v Maida [2002] FCA 1284 ; (2002) 36 AAR 69 in determining whether there was a change in his patho physiological condition in about 1998 after becoming symptomatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Tribunal accepted that the applicant had continuing attacks since 1998, that he now took antibiotics and was periodically immobilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The change in his patho physiological condition satisfied the definition in West and Maida of a new impairment and was compensable under the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">(iv) The Tribunal erred by not correctly applying the principles in West and Maida to consider and determine whether the applicant suffered a qualitative change to his condition in 1998 so as to constitute a new impairment which is compensable under the SRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">(v) The Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider whether the applicant suffered from a new impairment or impairments after becoming symptomatic in 1998, and whether the condition of cellulitis was the same or different from any new impairment that he may have suffered after 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 

15 The applicant's third ground involved a contention that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons as required by s 43(2) and (2B) of the AAT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The applicant identifies four areas in relation to which the AAT allegedly failed to state its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The reasons which the applicant alleged that the Tribunal was required to and failed to state, in the context of its findings and the circumstances of the case, are as follows:
 
(i) Whether the cellulitis condition satisfied the definition of impairment under s 4 of the SRC Act between 1984 and 1998;
 
(ii) The nature of the patho physiological condition and what, if any, impairment or impairments the applicant suffered after 1998;
 
(iii) What change occurred to his condition after 1998, including:
 
 o whether he suffered any new impairment, 
 
 o whether after 1998 he suffered any significant worsening to an impairment, 
 
 o whether there was a change in the applicant's symptoms so as to produce or cause any new impairment which was not present prior to 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">(iv) The nature of any qualitative change to the applicant's cellulitis condition or impairment in accordance with the principles in Maida and West .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">16 The applicant does not press the parts of this ground of appeal relating to the Tribunal's alleged failure to state its reasons as to why cellulitis is not a skin condition and why it is not a condition affecting the lymphatic system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">17 The respondent submitted that the applicant's contention that he did not suffer impairment between 1984 and 1998 because he did not suffer symptoms during that period could not be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It noted that the definition of "impairment" in s 4 of the SRC Act does not refer to symptoms and, relevantly, provides that impairment means damage of any bodily system or part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">On the evidence accepted by the Tribunal, there was ample support for the conclusion that the applicant suffered an impairment in 1984 and therefore the conclusion reached by the Tribunal was plainly open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">18 The respondent also submitted that the applicant appeared to contend that if the Tribunal concluded that the applicant's condition did not gradually worsen, then the Tribunal was required to find that he suffered a new impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The respondent submitted that this argument was misconceived and that West in fact established that a new impairment would only arise where a change in patho physiological condition had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In the present case, the Tribunal had clearly and correctly found on the evidence that the underlying patho physiology had not changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">19 The respondent also challenged the applicant's apparent contention that taking medication and suffering from periods of incapacity were indicia of a change of patho physiological condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The respondent submitted that such factors merely indicated an increase in the level of symptoms or an increase in the degree of impairment and not a new impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">20 In relation to the applicant's claim that the Tribunal had failed to consider whether he suffered a new impairment, the respondent contended that this argument could not be maintained since the Tribunal clearly identified it as an issue which it had to determine and made a clear finding that there had been no change in the underlying patho physiology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">21 As to the third ground, the respondent submitted that the Tribunal had complied with its duty under s 43(2B) by identifying evidence upon which to support its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It contended that what the applicant really sought were reasons for the Tribunal's findings, whereas s 43(2B) required the Tribunal to give reasons for its decision .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The matters identified by the applicant were issues about which the Tribunal had made findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">22 The application of s 24 of the SRC Act to individuals who developed permanent impairments before the relevant provisions of the SRC Act came into force has been considered in a number of Full Court decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In large measure, the submissions of the parties focused on these decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In West , Merkel J (with whom O'Connor J agreed) held that (at 512):
 
 "... where a change in a permanent impairment occurring after the commencement date is such that, quantitatively and qualitatively, it is properly to be characterised as a further or new impairment occurring after the commencement date it is compensable date it is compensable by a lump sum payment under s 24 ..." 
 

23 In Maida , Mansfield J accepted the following propositions as a correct summary of the law:
 
 (i) The gradual worsening of the degree of impairment does not constitute a new impairment;
 (ii) If there is no change in the patho physiological condition causing an impairment then any worsening of an existing impairment will not constitute a new impairment; and
 (iii) A significant worsening may constitute a new impairment if there has been a change in the underlying patho physiological condition, so that there has been a qualitative change to the impairment --- that is, the development of a new impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 
 

24 In my opinion, these authorities are of limited relevance to the present matter insofar as they concern the gradual worsening of a pre-existing impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">However, West is relevant for other reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was necessary for the Tribunal to ask and answer a series of questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The first was whether the applicant suffered an injury as defined in s 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The report of Dr Roth proceeded on the basis that the injury was the laceration to his right leg and after suffering that injury he subsequently developed cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Dr Butler appeared to proceed on the same basis, as did Professor Lord.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal also appeared to accept that the injury was the laceration of the right leg which then led to the "condition of cellulitis in his right leg".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">What that means is not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It may have meant that the Tribunal viewed the original injury either as not simply the laceration but also be ensuing cellulitis or, perhaps, only the cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The position of the parties before the Tribunal was that the injury was the cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The medical evidence was to the effect that cellulitis is the inflammation and infection of the soft tissues of, in the applicant's case, the leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The evidence did not point to, nor did the Tribunal find, that the applicant suffered from a chronic swelling and infection of the right leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">At its highest, the evidence was that once a person has had cellulitis, there was an increased likelihood of the person having it again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">25 The Tribunal then said that in 1998 "the symptoms suddenly occurred".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It appears that the Tribunal was saying that the symptoms of cellulitis suddenly appeared because the applicant's leg became infected and swollen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">But that is no more than saying that the applicant had the symptoms of cellulitis because he was suffering, at that point, from cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">However, the difficulties arise, in my opinion, in the Tribunal's later analysis where it speaks of the "current cellulitis" being the result of two factors, the " existing cellulitis and the diabetes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is not clear what the Tribunal meant when it spoke of "existing" cellulitis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It is as if the Tribunal viewed cellulitis as a condition which subsisted continuously but was symptomatic only periodically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">26 The second question is whether that injury has resulted in impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is not clear what the Tribunal was considering as the possible impairment bearing in mind that, relevantly, it was addressing the question of whether the injury the applicant had suffered had resulted in permanent impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Impairment is defined as meaning the loss or the loss of the use of or damage or malfunction in any part of the body of any bodily system or function or part of such system or function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The applicant's claim, at least as it is now formulated, was that the impairment was (or at least included) the partial loss of the use of his right leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The Tribunal appears to have approached the matter on the basis that the impairment was damage to the lymphatic system caused by the original laceration and consequential infection and swelling, namely the cellulitis suffered by the applicant in 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The Tribunal suggested, correctly, that the evidence of Professor Lord and Dr Butler pointed to damage to the lymphatic system having been caused by the original injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However, what the Tribunal did not address was whether there had been any loss of the use of the right leg which, itself, constituted an impairment as defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">27 As I understand the authorities, and in particular what was said in West by Heerey J at 498 and Merkel J at 512 (O'Connor J agreeing with Merkel J), it is possible for a person to suffer an injury which results in losses or malfunctions manifesting themselves in different parts of the body over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There is no reason, in principle, why some or all of those losses or malfunctions cannot each be treated as an impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">After the hearing, the High Court handed down its reasons in Canute v Comcare [2006] HCA 47 where the Court noted that "Textually, the Act assumes that "an injury" may result in more than one "impairment" (at [11]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The parties declined an offer to make submissions about this decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In the present case, the Tribunal did not address the question of whether the loss of the use of the leg was an impairment caused by the original injury and, if so, whether that impairment occurred after the commencing day for the purposes of s 124(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">While it is ultimately a matter of fact for the Tribunal, the evidence points to an affirmative answer to both questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 What the Tribunal did not do, in my opinion, was to approach the matter in the way contemplated by s 124.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">I should add that many of the observations I have made about the approach of the Tribunal should not be taken to be a criticism of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The case as developed on behalf of the applicant before the Tribunal was obscure and opaque, at least having regard to the material in the appeal book (the opening and final submissions but not the statements of facts and contentions).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The Tribunal was probably distracted by reliance by the applicant's counsel on West as it concerns the gradual worsening of a pre-existing impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Section 124 requires the Tribunal, at least in a case such as the present where there is a serious issue about whether payment for any compensable impairment is to be made under the 1971 Actor the SRC Act , to consider whether the claimant suffered a permanent impairment, in the defined sense, after 1 December 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, then compensation is to be assessed in accordance with s 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">29 In my opinion the Tribunal erred in law and its decision should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I do not think remitting the matter to the Tribunal can be said to be futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Further findings will need to be made by the Tribunal before a conclusion can be reached about the matter referred to at [27] and as to whether, for the purposes of s 24 , the injury to the applicant has resulted in a permanent impairment and, if so, was it compensable and in what way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">I propose to extend time, make orders setting aside the Tribunal's decision and remitting the matter to the Tribunal for further consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The respondent should pay the applicant's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
