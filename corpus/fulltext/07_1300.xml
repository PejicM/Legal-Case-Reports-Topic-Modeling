1 The appellant taxpayer appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Mr BH Pascoe, Senior Member) which affirmed an objection decision of the respondent Deputy Commissioner in respect of the 1997 and 1998 tax years: Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] AATA 750 ; (2006) 64 ATR 1075.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The assessments resulted from an audit of the affairs of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The issues on the appeal concern the ascertainment of gross sales and the deduction of purchases in connection with a retail business carried on by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) an appeal lies to the Federal Court only on a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 In October 1995 the appellant commenced a duty free retail business in Springvale, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In January 2002 the Australian Tax Office conducted an audit of the appellant's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">An assessment was issued for 1997 and an amended assessment for 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">After extensive discussions with the appellant's then accountant, objections were allowed in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The business was financed by gifts, loans or capital contributions from the appellant's family, and in particular his father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant admitted that he was not knowledgeable about business practices and record-keeping requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 The appellant's original 1997 return showed sales of $1,101,758 which he said was based on bank deposits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">When the appellant said that invoices were a more reliable basis for assessing income, the Commissioner agreed to accept a figure of $884,533 based on invoices, provided that the difference between that amount and the bank account deposits (which on the Commissioner's calculation amounted to $1,084,705) did not represent assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 Over several months, between May and August 2003, the appellant attempted to provide details of this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He said the difference between the bank deposits and the sales invoices represented gifts or loans from his father used as working capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Neither he nor his father had kept any record of such gifts or loans, save for the amount referred to in [7] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 In evidence before the Tribunal the appellant claimed $240,000 as the amount of his father's contributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This amount was obtained from a Betterment Statement produced by the Commissioner from an earlier audit of the father's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">This amount had been included as expenditure by the father "as set up costs for the son's business" for the 1996 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">But no record of either father or son was produced to confirm that or any other amount, except that the appellant did produce his own banking records and a credit card statement of his father as evidence of a total of $44,800 provided by his father on 8 July 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 The Tribunal at [12] was prepared to accept that $44,800 of the bankings represented funds provided by the father, but this left some $155,000 to be explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">However, as the Tribunal had noted at [10], the evidence of the appellant was that he used cash from sales for personal drawings and not all cash sale receipts were banked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There was no record produced of the unbanked amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In the Tribunal's view it was quite possible that such unbanked receipts equalled or exceeded the $44,800.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As a consequence the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had discharged the onus of proof to demonstrate the actual, or even reasonable, figure of gross revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 As to purchases, the appellant produced a computer generated list of purchases for the 1997 year which totalled $943,278.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">This figure exceeded the amount shown in his amended tax return ($872,117) by $71,161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Tribunal said at [13] (emphasis in original):
 
 "This list appeared to have been produced from the MYOB system and shows the name of each supplier, the date, varying from July 1996 to June 1997, and the amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is assumed, although not demonstrated in evidence, that it is argued that this list calculated purchases on an accrual basis whereas the figure in the amended return was on a cash basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Again there is no accounting evidence to demonstrate any reconciliation between the two figures of purchases or that any amounts in the list produced do not relate to expenses other than purchases .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In addition there is no evidence that this list of purchases has been reconciled with the amounts shown as opening and closing stock to produce a correct figure for cost of sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Given this complete lack of appropriate accounting evidence it is not possible to be satisfied that net income has been overstated by $71,161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 

10 As to the 1998 year, the position of the appellant was simply that if his contention in relation to purchases was accepted for 1997, there would need to be a corresponding adjustment against him for the 1998 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 In his notice of appeal the appellant stated the questions of law raised on the appeal as follows:
 
 
 "2.1 Whether on the evidence before the Tribunal it was reasonably open for the Tribunal to find: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that the sales income of the Appellant for the year of income ended 30 June 1997 was $1,101,758; 
 (b) that the Appellant did not bring into account for taxation purposes cash sales receipts in the amount that equals or exceeds $44,800; 
 (c) that the purchases for the year of income ended 30 June 107 were $872,117; 
 
 
 
 
 2.2 Whether on the findings of fact made by the Tribunal that $44,800 of the bankings for the year of income ended 30 June 1997 represented funds provided by the Appellant's father it was reasonably open for the Tribunal to conclude that the Appellant has failed to discharge the burden of showing that the assessments were excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 2.3 Whether the Tribunal erred in law in requiring the Appellant to reconcile amounts that represented purchases for the year of income ended 30 June 1997 on cash basis with those on accrual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 2.4 Whether the decision of the Tribunal was one to which no reasonable decision-maker would have come.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 2.5 Whether the Tribunal should have remitted the decision under review in relation to the years of income ended 30 June 1997 and 1998 for reconsideration by the Respondent pursuant to sections 42D and 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">" 
 

12 I am not persuaded that any of these questions are truly questions of law for the purpose of s 44(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">While counsel for the Commissioner accepts that a question whether a finding was based on no evidence would be a question of law, the present case has to be considered in light of the onus of proof imposed on the taxpayer by s 14ZZK(b)(i) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The appellant has to prove not only a case of error, but what the correct assessment was: Trautwein v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1936] HCA 77 ; (1936) 56 CLR 63 at 88, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 at 623.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Questions as to what were the true amount of the appellant's gross income and purchases in the 1997 year were questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">For the reasons explained by the Tribunal, the appellant did not establish any different figures from those assessed by the Commissioner on the basis of the appellant's own financial records, such as they were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">13 The appeal will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Associate:
