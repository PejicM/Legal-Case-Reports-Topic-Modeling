 INTRODUCTION 
 Parties
 The applicant, Clough Engineering Limited ("Clough") and the first respondent, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ("ONGC") are parties to a construction contract ("Construction Contract").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The formal contract was made in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It is a lump sum contract in excess of US$215 million and is for the development of certain oil and gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin off the coast of the State of Andhra Pradesh in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Additionally, onshore facilities were to be constructed at Odalarevu, Near Amlapuram also in Andhra Pradesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Clough is an Australian company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">ONGC is an Indian company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">By instruments dated January 2005 ("performance guarantees"), each of the second to fourth Respondents ("Banks") equally between them guaranteed the payment of 10% of the contract price to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This equated to a little more than US$21.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Banks are Australian companies, and the guarantees were entered into in Australia, and any demands thereunder are to be received in, and acted upon, in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Construction Contract and guarantees contain Indian choice of law and forum clauses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">ONGC made demands upon the Banks, HSBC Bank Australia Limited (HSBC) in Perth and upon the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and BNP Paribas in Sydney under the performance guarantees, on 4 June 2007, which was a Perth public holiday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These proceedings were commenced the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Construction Contract was terminated by ONGC by a facsimile letter to Clough of 4 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">PREVIOUS ORDERS MADE BY THE COURT 
 
 (a) On 5 June 2007 an ex parte interlocutory injunction was granted against the Banks restraining each of them from making payment to ONGC under the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This injunction was extended on 12 June 2007 and on 19 June 2007, following an inter parties hearing, when an application by the Banks to discharge the injunction was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">(b) On 7 June 2007 an ex parte interim injunction was granted against ONGC restraining it from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment, or renewing such claims or demands, from the Banks under the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The injunction was extended on 12 and 19 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">(c) On 7 June 2007 e x parte orders for leave to serve ONGC ex juris were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">THE BASIS OF CLOUGH'S CLAIMS FOR RELIEF 
 Clough has sought to restrain the calling on, or payment under, the performance guarantees for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The first, it submits, is that the Construction Contact, properly construed, prohibits a demand being made in the prevailing circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The second, alternative, basis is that even if the Construction Contract, by its terms, does not preclude making a demand under the guarantees, nevertheless ONGC has caused or contributed to the circumstances leading to the asserted breach of the Construction Contract by Clough, upon which ONGC relies to make a demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The third is that alternatively, ONGC's demand constituted unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten laws of Australia, in contravention of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TPA").</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Finally, it is said, that the demand served by ONGC does not conform with the criteria required of a valid demand on the proper construction of the guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Clough's claims against the Banks concern their intention to pay under the performance guarantees where such payment would constitute the Bank's being, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in ONGC's contraventions of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Injunctive relief is available against the Banks under s 80 of the TPA: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">2) [2007] FCA 927 at [11] - [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Injunctive and other relief would also be available under s 87(1A) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Banks are respondents and potentially liable in their own right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">ONGC is not a necessary party to the claim against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It is not necessary for Clough to join ONGC in order to establish its claims against the Banks : Matheson Engineers Pty Limited v El Raghy [1992] FCA 417 ; (1992) 37 FCR 6 at 9; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Albert (2005) 223 ALR 467 at [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Of course ONGC, whilst not a necessary party, is amenable as a "proper" party to be joined if in the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">A "proper", as distinct from a "necessary" party, is a person who has sufficient connexion to the controversy that he or she might be joined, "but whose absence will not affect the constitution of the action": Edge, in the matter of Eco Panels Australasia Pty Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 30 at [12] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As a person who would be a proper party if it were in the jurisdiction, ONGC would be thus amenable to the courts jurisdiction under FCR O 8 r 2, Item 18 (like the former FCR O 8 r 1(g)): Quinlan v Safe International F&ouml;rs&auml;krings AB [2005] FCA 1362 at [24] , applying Costa Vraca Pty Ltd v Bell Regal Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 305.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">THE MOTION 
 Since 19 June 2007 ONGC has entered a conditional appearance and by Notice of Motion filed on 20 July 2007 seeks orders relevantly: 
 (1) that, pursuant to Order 9 Rules 7(1)(a), (b) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules:
 (a) the Amended Application be set aside;
 
 (b) the service of the Amended Application on the First Respondent be set aside;
 (c) Order 2 made by the Court on 7 June 2007 be discharged; and
 
 (d) the injunction granted against the First Respondent on 7 June 2007, as extended on 12 and 19 June 2007, be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">(2) In the alternative:
 
 (a) pursuant to Article 8(1) of Schedule 2 (the Model Law) to, and/or section 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth), referring the dispute between the Applicant and the First Respondent the subject of these proceedings to arbitration in accordance with clause 1.3.2 of the General Conditions of the written contract between the Applicant and the First Respondent dated 6 January 2005 (the Contract) before the Arbitral Tribunal, being the Honourable Mr Justice B N Srikrishna (retired), the Honourable Mr Justice V N Khare (retired) and the Presiding Arbitrator to be appointed jointly by the Honourable Justices Srikrishna and Khare (the Arbitral Tribunal);
 
 (b) discharging the injunctions granted on 5 and 7 June 2007, as extended on 12 and 19 June 2007; and
 
 (c) otherwise dismissing or staying the whole proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">ONGC seeks, by its motion not only to have the injunction granted against it discharged, whether by reason of the fact that service is set aside with consequential discharge or by reason of the fact that the proceedings against it are bound to be referred to arbitration, but also seeks to have the injunctions granted against the Banks discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Clough concedes that ONGC, as a third party affected by these orders, is entitled to seek this relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The application is supported by the affidavits of Simon Lee sworn 20 July 2007, Yelluru Jayarama sworn 21 August 2007 and Dean Grondal sworn 22 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The orders, including injunctive orders, previously obtained by Clough against ONGC were obtained on an ex parte basis, and supported by affidavit material which was uncontested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">ONGC had not entered an appearance at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Only ONGC could contradict Clough's case that Clough was not in breach of the Construction Contract, or where it was in breach, that this was occasioned by ONGC's breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Accordingly, the claim by Clough, that ONGC was in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA, proceeded on the basis of unchallenged fact, namely, that ONGC had called for payment under the performance guarantees when there was no proper foundation for doing so, because Clough was not in breach of the Construction Contract or if it was, then this was as a direct consequence of breaches by ONGC: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">2) at [7] and [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It was not necessary, then, to consider the question of whether a call by ONGC under the performance guarantees could be made merely upon the basis of a bona fide claim of breach or whether it required, by admission or by curial or arbitral determination, a demonstrated actual breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">This was because, whatever the proper construction of cl 3.3.3, on the uncontroverted facts, a prima facie case, or serious issue that s 51AA had been contravened was made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Accordingly, I expressly left that question open: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">2) at [45].</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">For the first time in these proceedings, the question of construction requires to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is fundamental to the disposition of the Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">REHEARING 
 In relation to the application to set aside service of the Amended Application on ONGC, an application under O 9 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules (FCR) results in a review of the original decision to grant leave to serve ex juris and is a rehearing conducted on the basis of additional materials, recognising that a respondent should have "the opportunity to put before the Court any additional facts or arguments which might suggest that leave ought not to have been granted": Tycoon Holdings Limited v Trencor Jetco Inc [1992] FCA 25 ; (1992) 34 FCR 31 at 33; Bray v F Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (2003) 130 FCR 317 at [53] per Carr J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The onus remains on the applicant to satisfy the Court, in light of those additional materials and facts and arguments, that leave should have been granted: Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 at 564.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">To maintain service ex juris , Clough needs to demonstrate a prima facie case for the relief claimed: FCR O 8, r 3(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The threshold for demonstrating a prima facie case is not high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is whether on the material before the Court, inferences are open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881 at [36] ; Western Australian v Vetter Tritter (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 110; Puccini Festival Australia Pty Ltd v Nippon Express (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 288.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It requires the demonstration of an "arguable case", bearing in mind that this requirement is to be met at the outset of the action, "without the advantage of discovery and other procedural aids to the making out of a case": Ho v Akai Pty Limited (in liquidation) [2006] FCAFC 159 at [10] , [12], [37], [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The task of the Court, at this early stage of the proceedings, does not require evidence to justify a "finding" of the alleged TPA contravention: Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd at [96].</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is also for Clough to establish a case for the continuation of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">No onus lies on ONGC to discharge the injunctions: Resort Hotels Management Pty Ltd v Resort Hotels of Australia Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 730 at 731.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Accordingly, Clough requires to establish that there is a serious issue(s) to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I will firstly deal with the orders sought under paragraph 1 of the Notice of Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">This involves a consideration of whether Clough has established anew that it has a prima facie case to maintain the grant of service ex juris on ONGC and whether there are any serious issues to be tried to sustain injunctive relief, either pending a trial of issues in this Court, or were the matter to be referred to the Arbitrators in India, by way of a protective interim measure in aid of the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This, in particular, requires a detailed consideration of the following: The Construction of Clause 3.3 
 (a) the proper construction of the performance guarantee provisions in the Construction Contract; 
 
 TPA s 51AA 
 
 (b) was any breach of the Construction Contract, asserted or demonstrated, and relied upon by ONGC, arguably caused by breach(es) on the part of ONGC and if so was ONGC thereby in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA in making demands under the performance guarantees; 
 
 (c) was any demonstrated breach of the Construction Contract, relied upon by ONGC, not caused or even arguably caused by breach(es) on the part of ONGC thereby entitling ONGC to make demands under the performance guarantees; 
 
 The validity of the demand 
 
 (d) were the demands made by ONGC under the performance guarantees, invalid, on their face.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I will deal with each of these in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE CLAUSE 
 For the reasons that I have outlined, the construction of the performance guarantee clause (3.3) has not yet been considered by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">ONGC, the appropriate contradictor, but not previously before the Court, now raises this as a fundamental issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It is appropriate, in my view, to seek to resolve the construction issue, despite the interlocutory nature of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The hearing engaged some three days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Full argument was presented on the issue by both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There was no suggestion that the evidence before me, bearing on the construction issue, was other than complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The area of contest is neither beset by difficulty or novelty: Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535; Hitchcock v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2000] Aust Torts Reports p81-550 at [22]-[26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Sub-clauses 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of the Construction Contract provide as follows: 
 
 3.3.1 The Contractor shall furnish to the Company within 2 weeks from the date of signing of this Contract an unconditional and irrevocable Performance Bank Guarantee for due performance of the Contract, as per proforma given at Appendix ---II of the Annexure-A of Agreement for a sum equivalent to 10% of the Contract price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">This irrevocable Performance Bank Guarantee shall be drawn in favour of the Company and shall be valid initially up to a period of Scheduled Completion Date for the Works of the Contract and warranty period plus sixty (60) days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 

 
 
 3.3.2 In the event completion of Works is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date for any reasons whatsoever, the Contractor shall get the validity of the guarantee suitably extended so as to make it valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the actual date of completion of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However if the delay is attributable to the Company, Company shall bear the cost of extension of such performance guarantee for such extended period at the normal bank rates as applicable to International Banking procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 

 
 
 3.3.3 The Company shall have the right under this guarantee to invoke the Banker's guarantee and claim the amount there under in the event of the Contractor failing to honour any of the commitments entered into under this Contract .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In case Contractor fails to furnish the requisite Bank Guarantee as stipulated above, then the Company shall have the option to terminate the Contract and forfeit the Bid security amount and no compensation for the Works performed shall be payable upon such termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Upon completion of Works the above said guarantee shall be considered to constitute the Contractor's warranty for the Work done by him or for the Works supplied and their performance as per the specifications and any other conditions against this Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The warranty shall be in force for 12 months, from the completion date as provided in Clause 5.10.2 and 5.10.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">(Emphasis added) 
 

 The entitlement under cl 3.3.3 to invoke the performance guarantees is expressed to be conditional upon "the Contractor failing to honour any of the commitments entered into under this Contract".</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The principal issue is whether the words "failing to honour" mean that it is established as a fact that Clough has failed in some respect(s) to honour its contractual commitments or whether they bear a wider meaning which gives ONGC an entitlement to call upon the performance guarantees where it has simply asserted or claimed that Clough has so failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The construction spectrum at one end posits that the words "failing to honour" are incapable of accommodating any meaning involving an assertion or claimed breach, and that they must, inflexibly, apply to established breaches, and at the other end, that "failing to honour" must always and invariably mean an " asserted or claimed failure to honour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Clough's Submissions 
 Clough does not contend for the first approach although it submits that it is commended by the ordinary meaning of the words used in cl 3.3.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It points to a number of factors in its written submissions as informing the construction process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I set these out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">First, ONGC may withhold approval of progress payments, providing that it states the reasons for withholding payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Subject to stating reasons for withholding approval of progress payments, if Clough is to recover the disputed money, it must go to arbitration unless ONGC chooses to remove its objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">See cll 3.2.3-3.2.5 and 8.3.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">If, at the end of the arbitration, Clough proves an entitlement to the money, it may recover it, but without interest: cl 1.3.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">These provisions tend against the idea that the performance guarantee is required to protect ONGC in respect of any and all asserted or claimed breaches of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Secondly, one consideration that might be brought to bear in deciding whether a claimed or asserted entitlement to payment is intended to be sufficient, is where the claimed or asserted entitlement is made in the context of an independent party having first certified that a certain state of affairs exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Where the parties have entrusted, by agreement, an independent person with the task of being satisfied and certifying that a certain state of affairs exists, and the contract then provides for the payment of money if that state of affairs exists, a claimed entitlement to payment may be inferred to be sufficient: Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd v Varnsdorf Pty Ltd (1998) 3 VR 812 at 822.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It would be unusual, it was said, for an entitlement, particularly for A$25 million, to arise on mere assertion of breach, unconnected with some specific independent certification process, subject to one matter, discussed below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Thirdly, another consideration is that if the contract provides, expressly, for a right to deduct certain moneys, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">a right of self-help, it may be inferred that those particular moneys may be payable on an asserted or claimed entitlement: Fletcher v Varnsdorf at 822.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">There are, in this contract, specific provisions giving ONGC the right to deduct moneys in the period prior to practical completion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">They are found in cll 5.9.7.2 and 7.3.9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Notwithstanding the absence of a certification provision, and the onerous terms of cl 5.9.7.2, it may be inferred that the parties intended Clough to pay those amounts on assertion of breach, and for the performance guarantees to be called for that purpose, leaving Clough out of pocket whilst it fought out any dispute about that in an arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Fourthly, in the period after practical completion, a specific provision, similar to cl 5.9.7.2, also requires Clough to pay moneys to ONGC irrespective, it seems, of any dispute as to the validity of ONGC's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">This is cl 6.1.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Again, the provision is onerous in that it purports to require Clough to pay costs associated with reinstatement of the works simply upon a complaint of non-conformity by ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Again, that clause gives ONGC a right to deduct moneys, irrespective of the pendency of any unresolved dispute (by arbitration or otherwise), concerning ONGC's claims that the works are non-conforming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Again, the guarantees are likely to have been intended by the parties to operate on the strength of a claimed entitlement in this circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Fifthly, cl 6.3.2 is another provision which gives a right to deduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In the present circumstances, because there has been no agreed extended date for practical completion, it applies where there is an agreement or arbitral or other determination that ONGC has a right to recover liquidated damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Sixthly, the magnitude of the guarantees, totalling A$25 million, needs to be considered in the context of a construction which requires that any asserted breach, however trivial, or ephemeral, could see the contractor deprived of A$25 million working capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">That, it is said, would be a peculiar result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Seventhly, bearing in mind the above considerations, cl 3.3.3 operates to allocate risk to Clough in specified circumstances, and otherwise provides ONGC with substantial security by way of recourse to the Banks, in the event that Clough is slow to, or is unable or unwilling, to pay ONGC, where ONGC has established that Clough has failed to honour its commitments under the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Clough further submits that to the extent that this is relevant this construction also produces a construction capable of harmonious application with Appendix III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The pro-forma in Appendix III itself, again, conditions a call on "breach", not " asserted or claimed breach".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The words in Appendix III relating to payment "notwithstanding any dispute(s) pending before any... Arbitrator" and "without demur... and/or without reference to the Contractor" are intended to apply to the particular circumstances specified in the contract where the parties have required Clough to discharge an obligation, irrespective of any underlying dispute about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">This, for example, would relate to the various contractual provisions involving a right to deduct monies by ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Accordingly, in summary, Clough submits that on a proper construction of the Construction Contract, the performance guarantees are capable of being called on in particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">They are where: 
(a) there is an acknowledgment or arbitral or other determination giving ONGC the right to obtain moneys during the performance of the contract between Clough and ONGC prior to practical completion (other than in relation to the matters covered by cll 5.9.7.2 and 7.3.9 of the contract);
 
(b) Clough fails to pay an amount claimed by ONGC under cl 5.9.7.2 (for, effectively, the cost of the removal and substitution of suitable materials or the removal and rectification of any work) or fails to pay money claimed by ONGC under cl 7.3.9 (for, effectively, any premium paid for insurance by ONGC);
 
(c) Clough fails to pay for the cost of remedial works within 30 days during the Guarantee/Warranty period as required under cl 6.1.2 of the contract; and
 
(d) there is an acknowledgement or arbitral or other determination that ONGC has a right to recover liquidated damages under cl 6.3.2 of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Reasoning
 The terms of the performance guarantees to be entered into under the Construction Contract are contained in Appendix III (not II) of Annexure A to the Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Clause 3.3.3 requires to be construed in the context of the document as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This includes the context of Appendix III of Annexure A: see, for example, Re Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Ex parte the Hoyts Corporation Pty Limited [1993] HCA 40 ; (1993) 178 CLR 379 at 386-387.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The performance guarantees prescribed by the Construction Contract accordingly promise payment even where disputes, which could include disputes as to whether or not Clough had failed to honour any of its commitments under the Construction Contract, are pending before a Court or arbitrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">This, in my opinion, is a powerful indicator that a mere claimed breach of contract, which is not fraudulently asserted is sufficient to trigger entitlement to call on the performance guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Clough does not assert that ONGC has made a fraudulent claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This construction is reinforced by the fact that, under the prescribed terms of the guarantees, the Banks are required to pay "without any demur, reservation, contest or protest and/or without any reference to the Contractor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Under the terms of the performance guarantees, each of the Banks was entitled to treat the written demand by ONGC as conclusive and binding as to the amount due and payable, notwithstanding any dispute pending before any Court, Tribunal, Arbitrator or any other authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Liability under the performance guarantees was absolute and unequivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Accordingly, the demands in this case are equivalent to the certificate provided by the National Australia Bank (NAB) to HSBC, certifying in effect that the conditions of the letter of credit had been met: Ideas Plus Investments Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd (2006) 32 WAR 467 at [14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The Western Australian Court of Appeal held that the certificate "amounted to no more than an implied representation that it had reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate" at [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The reasonable grounds were the bona fide belief by NAB that the conditions were satisfied at [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The written demands are also analogous to the requisite statutory declaration in Fletcher Construction v Varnsdorf at p 830 to the effect that the amount claimed represented an amount(s) remaining unpaid to the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">This was so even where the amount was disputed by the contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">If it were the case that, on its proper construction, ONGC could not call on the guarantees until there was an admitted or established breach of contract, the time at which an arbitral tribunal or court might determine that matter could well be after the performance guarantees had expired: cf Ideas Plus Investments at [39] per Steytler P. Such a construction does not, in my view, make commercial common sense: McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia Limited (2000) 203 CLR 579 at [22] and [23] per Gleeson CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The performance guarantees secured the Contractor's 12 month warranty under the Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Assume a major defect was discovered by ONGC late in the Warranty period, say only one month prior to expiry of the performance guarantees, but was not acknowledged by Clough as resulting from any failure by it to honour its commitments under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">On Clough's construction, it would not be open to ONGC to call on the performance guarantees until a Court or Tribunal had found a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">However, it is most unlikely that any such issue could be determined, especially in the context of a complex construction project, within a one month time frame.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">By the time it had been determined, in ONGC's favour, the guarantees would have expired, and the intended contractual security would be lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I consider that a commercial object of the requirement for performance guarantees under the Construction Contract is to allocate the risk of a party being out of pocket pending the resolution of any dispute and that ONGC was entitled to call upon the guarantees even where a genuine dispute existed, as to whether or not Clough was in breach and whether or not damages had been suffered: Fletcher Construction v Varsdorf at p 821 per Charles JA and at p 826 per Callaway JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">That case concerned irrevocable standby letters of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nonetheless it is of assistance, in principle, in approaching the construction of the performance guarantees, which informs the construction of cl 3.3 as a whole and, for present purposes, cl 3.3.3 in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Clough was required by cl 3.3.1 to furnish to ONGC within two weeks of signing the Construction Contract an "unconditional and irrevocable" performance bank guarantee for the due performance of the contract in terms of a proforma guarantee set out in an appendix to the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This lends force to ONGC's construction: Fletcher Construction v Varsdorf at p 822 per Charles JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In that passage his Honour cited Hudson on Building and Engineering Contracts (para 17,075) which asserts that: 
 
 Insofar as a construction contract may make clear provision for the furnishing of an unconditional guarantee as security for due performance, the normal interpretation, ... will be that, in response to the stipulated demand, an unqualified transfer of the sums in question is intended, provided only that there is a bona fide dispute or claim on the secured party's part, and that any further investigation of its merits or extent is not usually intended by the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 

 Bachmann Pty Ltd v B.H.P Power New Zealand Ltd [1998] VSCA 40 ; [1999] 1 VR 420 involved consideration of a letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The supplier in Bachmann did not seek to establish any case of fraud on the purchaser's part but relied only on the contractual qualification upon the purchaser's powers under the general conditions of the underlying contract to demand payment under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It was conceded that the clause referred to constituted a contractual qualification on the purchaser's powers in relation to the security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">This is to be contrasted with earlier Australian cases where the initial question was whether the underlying contract, on its proper construction, qualified the security holder's powers to claim under the security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The only point in the appeal as his Honour put it was as to the content of the qualification at [30].</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">His Honour canvassed a number of cases in which the proper construction of the language contained in the standby letter of credit, "... until the party becomes entitled to exercise a right under the contract ..." had been similarly discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Those authorities range from requiring no more than a claimed entitlement which is not specious or fanciful: Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Telede Pty Ltd (1989) 7 BCL 210 to requiring that the holder of the security establish, whether by litigation or arbitration, an actual entitlement to payment of the moneys: Mitsui Kensetsu Corporation Australia Pty Ltd v State of South Australia (unreported Qld Supreme Court, 9 August 1990 per Byrne J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Ultimately, as a matter of construction of the particular standby letter of credit, his Honour concluded that as between the purchaser and the supplier, the purchaser was entitled to have recourse to the security where according to a bona fide claim made by the purchaser monies were due to it from the supplier which exceeded any monies due from it to the supplier at [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In Ideas Plus Investments Steytler P, with whom McLure and Buss JJA agreed, concluded that the NAB was empowered to claim under a letter of credit granted by HSBC so long as it had a bona fide belief that the conditions were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The certificate by the NAB issued to HSBC certifying in effect that the conditions of the letter of credit had been met was only a representation of such a bona fide belief and perhaps that there were reasonable grounds for such a belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">[55]-[57], [105] See also Fletcher Construction v Varsdorf at p 830.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Steytler P with whom McLure JA agreed held that the basis for the payment made by HSBC pursuant to its independent obligation to NAB under the letter of credit was the provision by NAB of a certificate in the required terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It was, his Honour found, the presentation of that certificate, not the truth of the facts certified, which conditioned HSBC's obligation to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The provision of cll 3.2.3-3.2.5 and 8.3.5 do not, in my view, assist the construction contended for by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Those concern the contractual entitlement of ONGC to withhold approval and payment of progress claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">That entitlement provides a form of security to ONGC where there is a dispute because, pending arbitration, it is not required to pay the disputed amounts to Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It does not inform the question of the circumstances in which the performance guarantees may be called upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Nor do I consider that the absence of an independent certification as to the existence of a certain state of affairs to trigger the obligation to make payment advances Clough's argument on construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">That is but one type of mechanism for payment in a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Its absence does not assist the construction of this contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The fact relied upon by Clough that ONGC has the right variously to deduct monies (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">cll 5.9.7.2 and 7.3.9) or that Clough is required to pay certain monies, irrespective of the existence of a dispute (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">cl 6.1.2) actually serves, in my opinion, to reinforce the view that one of the purposes of the performance guarantees is to allocate the risk to which I have referred: Fletcher Construction v Varsdorf at p 829 per Callaway JA, Batt JA concurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The entitlement of ONGC, under cl 6.3.2, to payment of contractually ascertained and agreed liquidated damages equal to 3% of the total contract price for each month of delayed completion of the entire Works or a part of these, and to recover these by a call upon the performance guarantees, is also of no assistance to Clough's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The clause is but an example of a particular circumstance when the performance guarantees may be called upon and puts that entitlement beyond doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It does not, in my opinion, assist Clough's construction of cl 3.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Clough submits that ONGC's construction would permit a call on the full amount of the performance guarantees, approximately US$21.5 million even in the case of a trivial or ephemeral breach, and that this would be a peculiar result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">As to this, it should be recognised that equity will generally intervene to ameliorate the application of a legal right if it is employed capriciously or unreasonably or harshly, or oppressively such as to be unconscionable: Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer [1973] HCA 13 ; (1973) 130 CLR 575 at 587-588 and 590-591; NC Seddon &amp; MP Ellinghaus, Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (8 th Aust.</sentence>

<sentence id="s170">Section 51AA of the TPA likewise may afford relevant protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">This however does not mean that the entitlement at law to call on the whole amount under the performance guarantees should be read down from what is otherwise a construction which is in harmony with the contract as a whole and which in its context produces a commercially sensible meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Furthermore, to the extent that the calling up of the performance guarantees resulted in an overpayment to ONGC then there would be an entitlement in Clough to an 'accounting' in due course from ONGC: Cargill International SA Antigua Geneva Branch v Bangladesh Sugar &amp; Food Industries Corporation [1996] 4 All ER 563 at 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Accordingly, in my opinion, upon the proper construction of cl 3.3.3, ONGC was entitled to call on the performance guarantees where it had a bona fide belief in the genuineness of its claim that Clough had failed to honour commitments under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Of course, even on Clough's case, ONGC was entitled to call on the performance guarantees in the case of demonstrated breach, not caused by ONGC's breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">I will consider that important question in the context of the following analysis of the claims by Clough that ONGC, in making demands, under the performance guarantees was acting in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It follows that I do not consider there to be a prima facie case or a serious issue to be tried as to the construction contended for by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">SECTION 51AA TPA 
 I have found that, on the proper construction of the Construction Contract, the performance guarantees could be invoked upon the basis merely of an asserted failure on the part of Clough to honour its commitments under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">However, there are examples of demonstrated breach as well as merely asserted breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Clough accepts that it is in breach in a number of respects, for example: 
(a) Clough has not delivered three 'Christmas Trees'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">These are vital components for well-completion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Clough accepts that these have not been delivered although it has largely been paid for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">(b) Clough has failed to undertake certain shallow water works and onshore works separately from the off-shore works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">However, it is said by Clough that these breaches of the Construction Contract were caused by ONGC itself being in breach and that it would be unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AA of the TPA in those circumstances, for ONGC to call upon the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In particular, Clough contends that the delay in its providing the 'Christmas Trees' was caused by breach on the part of ONGC relating to the 'DHPTT Cards'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">It also asserts that ONGC was in breach in other respects, such as failing to effect well-completion in relation to the deep water work and that ONGC lost the first 'Christmas Tree' and certain tools, all of which contributed to delays of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The failure to undertake shallow water works, likewise, Clough says, was occasioned by breaches on the part of ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It is not possible to resolve these factual questions and whether those asserted breaches were occasioned by ONGC's own breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">This in turn gives rise to a prima facie case or a serious issue to be tried, whether based on those asserted breaches, ONGC acted unconscionably contrary to s 51AA of the TPA in calling up the performance guarantees: Reed Construction Services Pty Ltd v Kheng Seng (Australia) Pty Ltd (1999) 15 BCL 158 at 164.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">However, this does not determine the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">ONGC contends that Clough is indisputably in breach of its contractual obligations in two further important respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">These concern Clough's obligations to extend the validity of the performance guarantees and to provide documentary proof that relevant insurance cover is being maintained by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">ONGC submits that these obligations exist, even assuming that the need for the extensions is the result of breach(es) on its part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I now turn to consider each of these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Breach of cl 3.3.2: The performance guarantees
 I have, again, set out cl 3.3.2 below, for ease of reference: 
 
 3.3.2 In the event completion of Works is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date for any reasons whatsoever, the Contractor shall get the validity of the guarantee suitably extended so as to make it valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the actual date of completion of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">However if the delay is attributable to the Company, Company shall bear the cost of extension of such performance guarantee for such extended period at the normal bank rates as applicable to International Banking procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 

 Clough contends that it is not in breach of an obligation under cl 3.3.2 because the Completion Date was not validly extended, leaving the Completion Date "at large" with the result that cl 3.3.2 could not be complied with, because the duration of any extension was uncertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Performance guarantees play a critical part in international commerce and in international construction contracts, in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">So much has been recognised by the courts on many occasions: the authorities are collected by Steytler P in Ideas Plus Investments at [32]-[34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">They were, objectively viewed, of critical importance to ONGC under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">This is manifest in two ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Under cl 3.2.1 of the Construction Contract, no payments become due and payable to Clough until Clough has furnished the necessary performance guarantees and the Certificate of Insurance to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">This would extend to performance guarantees whose validity was required to be extended under cl 3.3.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Furthermore, as its option, ONGC was entitled, under cl 3.3.3, where Clough failed to furnish the performance guarantee(s) to terminate the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Completion Date of the Works under the Construction Contract was 15 April 2006 (cll 2.2.5 and 6.3.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The warranty period under the Construction Contract is 12 months from the date of issue of the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance (cl 6.1.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Any performance guarantee was to be initially valid up to 14 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">This was by virtue of the provisions of cl 3.3.1, which provide for the period of validity to extend from the Completion Date, plus the warranty period and a further 60 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Each performance guarantee is expressed to be valid until 14 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In the event that completion is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date, Clough was liable to extend the validity of the performance guarantees accordingly, so as to maintain the same period of validity beyond that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">I will now examine the course of conduct between Clough and ONGC concerning the extension of the Completion Date and in turn the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">By correspondence commencing on 20 March 2006, Clough requested from ONGC an extension of time for completion of the work "beyond January 1, 2007".</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">There were further requests made by Clough in correspondence to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">By letter from ONGC to Clough dated 15 April 2006, and in response to these requests, ONGC provisionally extended the time for completion of the works to 31 January 2007 without prejudice to its rights to recover liquidated damages, in accordance with the provisions of the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">By letter dated 3 June 2006, ONGC required Clough to extend the performance guarantees as required under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This demand was repeated by letter to Clough from ONGC dated 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">On that same date, Clough in a letter to ONGC indicated that overall Project commissioning could only be implemented by 11 April 2007 and that the new Schedule Completion Date should be 11 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">By a letter dated 13 July 2006, Clough referred to its ongoing request for a reasonable extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The minutes of a meeting convened at the request of Clough and held between it and ONGC on 21 July 2006 in New Delhi disclosed that Clough agreed to adopt a "proactive approach to complete the Project expeditiously within the time frame set out i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">by the end of the working season 2007", which it was common ground, was the end of April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">By a letter dated 29 July 2006, ONGC again required Clough to extend the performance guarantees as required under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">This request was repeated in correspondence from ONGC to Clough dated 12 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In minutes of a meeting held between the parties dated 23 August 2006, it is noted that Clough was to review certain delivery dates critically and to seek ways to improve upon these such that the completion of the Project in April 2007 was not compromised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">By a letter from ONGC to Clough dated 4 September 2006, following meetings at a senior level between the two parties, ONGC advised Clough that the time for completion of the Project was extended to 13 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">By correspondence dated 7 October, 2 and 6 November 2006 and 29 March 2007, ONGC required Clough to extend the performance guarantees as required under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">In a letter to ONGC dated 3 April 2007, Clough stated: 
 
 As ONGC is aware, the Performance Bank Guarantee(s) (PBG) is current to 14 th June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Contract clause 3.3.2 provides for the extension of the PBG "to make it valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the actual date of completion of Works".</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The date of actual completion of Works is not now known nor can it be known until after the Way Forward has been determined and agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Rather than pre-empt the outcome of these deliberations by extending the validity of the PBG, CEL will wait until an agreement is reached concerning the Way Forward, and to then act accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">
 

 By letter of 11 April 2007, ONGC again provisionally granted a further extension of time for completion of the works until 30 April 2008 and yet again required Clough to extend the performance guarantees as required under the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This latter request was repeated in correspondence from ONGC to Clough dated 14 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">By letter dated 16 April 2007, Clough set out what it described as a 'road map' to meet certain objectives towards the completion of the Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">As part of the proposal, Clough said that it would require the three performance guarantees held by ONGC to be returned but that, in recognition that work would still be required to complete the onshore plant, Clough was willing to provide a performance guarantee to the value of 10% of the remaining work, which was US$2.17 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">By letter dated 1 June 2007, Clough's chief executive wrote to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">He wrote in the following terms: 
 
 I understand that the bonds (referring to the performance guarantees) currently expire in June and appreciate that allowing the bonds to lapse may be contrary to that agreed between ourselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I am seeking agreement from my Board to extend the bonds to ensure we have sufficient time to conclude our negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">This action is of course subject to your agreement to reach a negotiated exit solution as was the direction from Mr Bose at my last meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">
 

 By letter of 4 June 2007, ONGC yet again called on Clough to extend the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The performance guarantees were never extended beyond their original expiry date of 14 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Clough contends that the extension of time for the scheduled completion date of the Works by ONGC to 13 April 2007 was unilateral and was not the subject of mutual agreement between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">This is set out in its letter of 20 September 2006 to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">That letter concluded by stating that Clough was currently in the process of developing a revised Project Schedule in consultation with ONGC, and that Clough looked forward to working with ONGC in successfully completing the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">However, it was Clough who had earlier requested an extension of time by its letter dated 20 March 2006 for a completion of the work beyond 1 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It was in response to this that ONGC made a provisional extension of time to 31 January 2007 which met Clough's then request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I do not consider that the reservation of rights by ONGC to recover liquidated damages, or its asserted failure to acknowledge its own breach, detracts from the agreement reached between the parties extending the date for Practical Completion of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Furthermore, whatever be the status of ONGC's letter of 4 September 2006 on the question of the date for Practical Completion, at the meeting of 21 July 2006, in New Delhi, to which I have referred, Clough agreed to adopt a proactive approach to complete the Project by, in effect, the end of April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Even if that were read to mean not before the end of April 2007, nonetheless Clough was, in my opinion, obliged to extend the existing performance guarantees within a reasonable time from 21 July 2006, and which would be valid until the end of June 2008, being a period of one year plus 60 days from the end of April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Accordingly, in my opinion, Clough was obliged under cl 3.3.2 of the Construction Contract to extend the validity of the performance guarantees so that they would be valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the date of completion of Works as varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">On the basis of the two variations to which I have referred, Clough, within a reasonable time of the date of each variation, was required to extend the performance guarantees to 31 March 2008 and June 30 2008 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">What is a reasonable time is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It depends upon the circumstances and its limit is determined by what is fair to both parties: Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 567-568.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">I do not accept Clough's submissions that the date for Practical Completion was at large and therefore that cl 3.3.2 could not be complied with because the duration of the extension was not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Even if it were the case that cl 3.3.2 required Clough to extend the performance guarantees at any time prior to their lapsing, as Clough contends, it was clear as at: 
 (a) 16 April 2007 that Clough was not then prepared to extend the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">In a letter to ONGC it advised ONGC that it required the three performance guarantees then held by ONGC to be returned and stated that it was willing to provide a performance bond to the value of 10% of the remaining work, in the amount of US$2.17 million; and 
 
 (b) 1 June 2007 that the CEO of Clough had no relevant authority from Clough's Board to extend these and in any event such authorisation was, wrongly in my view, stated by him to be subject to ONGC agreeing to "reach a negotiated exit solution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The obligation under cl 3.3.2 is not so conditioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">As a matter of fact, the performance guarantees were never extended prior to the termination of the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Accordingly, whatever view is taken as to the obligation under cl 3.3.2 to extend the validity of the policies, Clough was in breach of this provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Breach of cl 7.3.8: Insurance 
 By cl 7.3.1 of the Construction Contract, Clough was required to take out certain insurance policies for the benefit of and in the joint names of itself and ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">These were to maintain cover in certain respects from the commencement of the Works until the date of issue of the Certificate of Completion and Acceptance and in certain other respects during the guarantee period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Insurance cover was required amongst other things, for 'Cargo Trains' and 'Contractors All Risks' as well as 'Third Party' (cl 7.3.6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Clause 7.3.8, relevantly, provides as follows: 
 
 7.3.8 The contractor shall prior to commencing any relevant part of the Works deliver to the Company, copies of the Insurance Policies as evidence that the required policies are in full force and effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">
 

 
 
 It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to pay the premium in time and to keep the policies of insurance, as required by the Contract, valid throughout the period of execution of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The Contractor shall wherever required produce to the Company the policy(ies) of insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">
 

 
 
 The Contractor shall produce a certificate from insurance company to the effect that all premia under the policy have been paid and indicating validity of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">... 
 

 In light of the extended time for completion of the Works, ONGC, in numerous correspondence addressed to Clough between 3 June 2006 and 14 April 2007, sought Clough's compliance with cl 7.3.8 in ensuring that all relevant policies were maintained and required Clough to furnish details of the extended policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">This was in effect a request for copies of the policies under cl 7.3.8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">ONGC also sought copies of relevant "Certificates of Currency" which, in effect, were the Certificates of Insurance referred to in cl 7.3.8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">However, Clough never provided copies of the requested policies of insurance valid for the extended dates for completion of the Works and in turn the extended warranty periods or relevant Certificates of Insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">It was entirely reasonable, at the time of the call on the performance guarantees, for ONGC to infer from the non-provision of these policies or the Certificate(s) of Insurance to it that Clough had failed to honour its obligation to secure their extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">In any event, Clough was, in this important respect, in breach of its contractual obligations to provide those documents whatever the actual position was as to the currency of the relevant policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The documents were never produced by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The requirement to provide the certificate(s) of insurance was of considerable significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The policies were for the benefit not only of Clough but also ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">As was the position with the performance guarantees, by cl 3.2.1, no payments became due and payable to Clough under the Construction Contract unless Clough furnished to ONGC the Certificate of Insurance as required by cl 7.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">No Prima Face Case or Serious Issues to be Tried
 I have concluded that, in any event, Clough was in actual breach of the Construction Contract in two important respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">First, it failed to extend the performance guarantees as required under cl 3.3.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Secondly, it failed to deliver copies of relevant policies of insurance and the Certificate(s) of Insurance covering the extended Completion date(s) and Warranty Period(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Whatever may be the position in respect of other breaches, the actual breaches concerning the performance guarantees, the extended policies of insurance and the Certificate of Insurance are in a different category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Clause 3.3.2 imposes an obligation upon Clough to extend the validity of the performance guarantees in the event completion of the Works is delayed beyond the Scheduled Completion Date " for any reasons whatsoever".</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The only concession, in that respect, to a situation where the delay was caused by ONGC is that it would have to bear the cost associated with obtaining such extension(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The obligation implicitly contemplates that the delay in completion may have arisen as a result of breach by ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Whatever other consequences might flow contractually or otherwise as a result, Clough remained obligated to extend the validity of the performance guarantees, and in turn to produce to Clough when asked, copies of the relevant policies and Certificate(s) of Insurance covering the extended completion date(s) and warranty period(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">It follows that, in calling up the performance guarantees in respect of those breaches, ONGC was acting according to a legal entitlement under cl 3.3.3 untainted by conduct which could even arguably be characterised as unconscionable in contravention of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The position is the same in relation to the breach by Clough of cl 7.3.8 concerning the insurance documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Accordingly, I am not persuaded that there is any prima facie case or serious issues to be tried in respect to the alleged contraventions of s 51AA of the TPA in those respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">This is sufficient to dispose of those questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">It is of no consequence that a prima facie case and serious issues to be tried arose in other respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">THE VALIDITY OF THE DEMANDS 
 Clough contends that the demands made by ONGC against the Banks were not valid, because each failed to contain a statement of an amount that is due and payable by Clough to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The performance guarantees it submits, disclose that a demand for all or less than the full amount of the sums under them is contemplated in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Taking the HSBC guarantee as illustrative, the words "any/all monies to the extent of US$7,178,371.86" , as well as "Any such demand ... shall be conclusive and binding, without any proof, on the Bank as regard the amount due and payable ..." were said to make good that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">I accept that the performance guarantees each contemplate that less than the full amount guaranteed might be the subject of a demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">However, each also contemplates a demand for the full amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">A demand for the full amount was made in each case predicated on an unequivocal statement that Clough was in breach of the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">I do not consider there to be any serious issue or prima facie case as to the invalidity of the demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">It is not necessary to consider the alternative orders sought by ONGC under para [2] of its motion because of the conclusion to which I have come in relation to paragraph [1] of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">In those circumstances, there is no basis for the continuation of injunctive orders as against the Banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">There cannot, given my conclusions in relation to ONGC, be any serious issue of statutory accessorial liability as against the Banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 
 I propose to make some findings in relation to the balance of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">This obviously is not to inform my discretion as to whether to grant injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">I have found that there is no serious issue to be tried and accordingly, the exercise of my discretion does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">It may be, in due course, that the strength of Clough's case will require to be considered in relation to the balance of convenience: Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 ; Appleton Papers Inc v Tomasetti Paper Pty Ltd (1983) 50 ALR 428 per McLelland J; Ingersoll-Rand (Aust) Ltd v Industrial Rollformers Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 177.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">This would be particularly so in this case, as the refusal of injunctive relief has the practical effect of a final determination of the issues: Kolback Securities Ltd; Cayne v Global Natural Resources plc [1984] 1 All ER 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">For the present however, such a consideration is not necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Should it become so, these findings would then arise for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In the reasons for judgment in Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 2] [2007] FCA 927 at [46] - [66] , I concluded that the balance of convenience strongly favoured the grant of injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">As I have said, ONGC, although a party, had not then appeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">This, importantly, meant that there was no party to contradict the existence of serious issues to be tried, as contended for by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I formed the view that to have discharged the injunctions could very well lead to irreparable harm to Clough, its shareholders, employees and third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">I concluded that damages would not be an adequate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">[66] The position has now changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">ONGC has appeared, put on evidence, cross-examined and advanced submissions through counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Clough's financial circumstances have also changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The changed position is disclosed by a further affidavit of Mr Simons sworn on 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The expression "G1 contract" as used in this affidavit is a reference to the Construction Contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">It is to the following effect: 
 
 (a) Clough's annual results for the financial year ended 30 June 2007 reported an audited loss of $105.3 million, which ' loss directly resulted from provisions taken on the BassGas and G1 contracts ', such that Clough is materially in default of its secured debt facilities with the Banks [3]-[5]; 
 

 
 
 (b) each of the Banks want Clough to repay all secured debt facilities and because of Clough's defaults and because of the legal action threatened by ONGC, the Banks will not allow the use of current facilities or extend any further facilities to Clough ' until such time as the injunction and the related matters are dissolved or otherwise dispensed with ' [6], such that Clough will not have sufficient available debt facilities to fund the encashment of the performance guarantees [7]; 
 

 
 
 (c) the announced capital raising ' will provide new liquidity to replace the cash that has been utilised in funding the costs on the G1 contract which have not been reimbursed or paid to Clough by ONGC ' [10]; 
 

 
 
 (d) Clough has paid creditors of US$167.4 million on the G1 contract, but has received payments from ONGC of only US$139.4 million, a cash short fall of US$28 million [11], and Clough still owed some A$52.4 million to creditors on the G1 contract [13]; 
 

 
 
 (e) between 1 July 2007 and 4 September 2007, Clough has paid G1 contract creditors about A$31.2 million, leaving a balance of A$21.2 million, which will need to be paid from cash flow [14]; 
 

 
 
 (f) the payments to G1 contract creditors is causing significant strain [15]; 
 

 
 
 (g) to replace Clough's cash deposits that have been depleted by reason of the G1 contract, Clough proposes to recapitalise to enable it to make payments to the remaining G1 contract creditors and fund its capital expansion [16]; 
 

 
 
 (h) the recapitalisation is not directed to funding the encashment of the performance guarantees but is for paying the G1 creditors, funding capital expansion and repaying the Banks [17] and, importantly, if the performance guarantees were paid, Clough would be prevented from some or all of these objectives, with the consequences described in Mr Simons' 28 May 2007 affidavit [18]; 
 

 
 
 (i) the proposed recapitalisation will not be completed until the end of December 2007 and is dependent upon shareholder approval [19]-[20].</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">
 

 CLOUGH'S SUBMISSIONS 
 Annexure RFS1 to Mr Simons' affidavit is Clough's release to the Australian Stock Exchange dated 28 August 2007 containing its preliminary final report for the year ended 30 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Clough says that it is important to understand the true tenor of its financial position by reference to that report, as follows: 
(a) Provisions of $130.7 million had been taken, which offset a year of underlying profit growth and the "management of these provisions and funding to support the growth strategy will require a refinancing " which the board and the major shareholders have approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">(b) The proposed capital raising, which will be voted at the AGM in November 2007, will raise $5.6 million from Murray &amp; Roberts through a share placement, $39.4 million through a renounceable rights issue to all shareholders, ie a total of $45 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">(c) The finance facilities which Clough has secured are:
 
(i) a short term loan facility of $25 million from Murray &amp; Roberts, which short term loan facility will be repayable on completion of the recapitalisation, such that Clough will have cash of only $20 million post the recapitalisation, against outstanding Construction Contract creditors of $21.2 million;
 
(ii) a loan guarantee facility from Murray &amp; Roberts of up to $160 million, that is to say, a facility under which Murray &amp; Roberts has agreed to guarantee loans that might be able to be secured from third-parties (ie banks) (and only to fund Clough's vessel investment programme), such that this facility does not give Clough cash, but an ability to raise cash supported by this guarantee --- the evidence is that the Banks are unwilling to provide further facilities to Clough until the injunction issue and the related matters with respect to the Construction Contract are resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">(d) It is a misnomer to suggest that Clough had $82.9 million of cash available to pay the performance guarantees in that, as at that point in time, Clough's current assets were $351.1 million and its current liabilities were $354.9 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Clough's balance sheet position is far from healthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">(e) Although the recapitalisation will allow Clough to deal with cash flow issues flowing from the BassGas and Construction Contract disputes and provide the necessary support for capital expenditure, Clough has also announced its intention to dispose of non-core assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">It can be readily inferred that this asset disposal is necessary to repay the Banks, as they have required repayment, as is made clear in [6] of Mr Simons' affidavit of 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">It also cannot be predicted, with confidence, that this asset disposal program will be successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Therefore, Clough submits that its financial position is far from secure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">It has a large number of creditors to pay, and a shortfall in payments from ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It has been required to repay the Banks and they are unwilling to provide further funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">It is not disputed that Clough has performed around 82% of the work under the contract and has only received around 66% of the contract price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Clough has had to raise short term debt from its shareholder, Murray &amp; Roberts, and has sought to recapitalise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The recapitalisation will be used as to $25 million to repay the short term debt facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Clough has, as required by the relevant accounting standards, provided for a payment under the performance guarantees but, regardless of that provision, Clough's cash position and its financial position is far from healthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Also, as to the $160 million loan guarantee facility, it is just that, and this has not given Clough an extra $160 million but rather an ability to raise $160 million on Murray &amp; Robert's guarantee specifically to support the facilities relating to Clough's vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">$160 million has not been raised and, in the circumstances, is difficult to raise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Mr Simons' evidence given during his cross-examination requires to be understood bearing the above in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">His evidence and the position, so Clough submits, are as follows: 
(a) Clough's cash position of $82.9 million does not indicate the true position in two respects, first, some $35 million is not available to Clough and held by PT Petrosea and, second, as explained, cash is not actually available because of Clough's existing current liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">(b) There is a difference between available debt facility limits and limits for other facilities (including for contingent instruments, foreign exchange facilities, hedging facilities).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">No cash is available under these latter types of facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">(c) The fact that Clough had excess capacity with respect to these other facilities (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">to secure other performance guarantees) does not mean, and says nothing about, Clough's ability to pay the Banks on the encashment of the subject performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">(d) Under the relevant accounting standards, Clough was required to make provision for the anticipated loss on the G1 contract, including by reason of the fact that the G1 contract has been terminated and the performance guarantees have been called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">When provisioning, it can readily be inferred that an attempt has been made to provide for the potential loss (as required by the accounting standards) offset against potential gains (through mitigation by, for example, selling the equipment the subject of the G1 contract).</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">There are currently proceedings in India relating to equipment the subject of the G1 contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">In those proceedings, ONGC seeks a delivery up of the equipment, and there is an issue about what ONGC is required to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">If the equipment is required to be delivered without payment or without sufficient payment then it can readily be inferred that Clough's provisioning would not have fully accounted for its actual loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">(e) The loan guarantee facility of up to $160 million is not available to Clough in terms of cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">(f) The suggestion that the provisioning was to pigeonhole or isolate the economic impact of the G1 contract misstates the position by failing to recognise the fact that the accounting standards required such provisioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">(g) The suggestion that credit approval has not been withdrawn fails to have regard to the evidence that the Banks require repayment (see also: [6] of Mr Simons' affidavit of 7 September 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">(h) The suggestion that Clough had other performance guarantees or bond facilities fails to have regard to the fact that these facilities do not generate new cash but enable performance guarantees or bonds to be provided on the basis that if they are called, Clough has to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">In paragraph 18 of Mr Simons' affidavit of 7 September 2007, he deposes to the fact that if the performance guarantees were paid, Clough would be prevented from achieving some or all of its objectives, with the consequences described in Mr Simons' 28 May 2007 affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">He was not cross-examined on this paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Clough will likely be prevented from achieving at least some of its objectives if it were required to pay the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Clough submits that there is no evidence that ONGC will be affected in any relevant way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Further, as at July 2007, as notified to Clough in September 2007, Atradius, Clough's underwriter supplier's for insurance credit facilities, withdrew credit support on grounds including Clough's dispute with ONGC (and its call on the performance guarantees), and the fact that Clough is now dependent on support from its largest shareholder Murray &amp; Roberts, which support is itself subject to conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Finally, Clough submits that its reputation would be affected by a call and payment under the subject performance guarantees and that this is not gainsaid by the assertion that its reputation survived the issues relating to the BassGas dispute and by the assertion that the subject dispute has been publicised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">What cannot be known, Clough says, is the extent to which it lost other projects because of negative publicity relating to the BassGas dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">What also cannot be known is the extent to which Clough's reputation will be further dented if the subject performance guarantees are required to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">That is the very reason, submits Clough, why the potential irreparable damage to reputation needs to be avoided --- it cannot easily be a matter of computation at a later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">ONGC'S SUBMISSIONS 
 ONGC responds to Clough's submissions as follows: 
(a) The principal significance of statements made in Clough's Annual Report (Exhibit 7) is that such statements confirm prior disclosures by Clough to the market as to its financial position, refinancing and provisioning and, critically, are inconsistent in key respects with submissions advanced on Clough's behalf which:
 
(i) suggest that the $160 million loan guarantee facility may not be effective to achieve the purposes for which it was established; 
 
(ii) cast doubt on the efficacy of the non-core asset disposal program;
 
(iii) cast doubt on the adequacy of provisioning;
 
(iv) suggest that the provisioning did not have the effect of pigeonholing or isolating the economic impact of the G1 contract; and 
 
(v) assert that Clough's financial position is far from secure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">(b) Clough's submissions in this respect are unsupported by the evidence, and contrary to Clough's written disclosures to the market, including its Annual Report published and filed in the course of the hearing of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">(c) The Court must accept Clough's publicly disclosed statements and position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Those statements indicate confidence by the board of Clough that:
 
(i) its provisioning in respect of ONGC is adequate;
 
(ii) the non-core asset disposal program would be successful; 
 
(iii) the $160 million loan guarantee facility would enable the implementation of the growth program; and
 
(iv) Clough's financial position was secure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">(d) Key excerpts from the Annual Report which support the submission made in the previous paragraph are as follows ("G1 Disputes" refers to disputes in relation to the Construction Contract):
 
 (i) Chairman's Report 
 
 Importantly, in order to manage the provisions and the growth strategy the Board has approved a refinancing of the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Murray &amp; Roberts will provide loan facilities and guarantees for up to US$185 million and in addition the Company has plans to raise $45 million through a rights issue and placement that will require shareholder approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">I also take this opportunity to thank our major shareholder Murray &amp; Roberts for their strategic advice and direction during the year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Their financial assistance has of course been invaluable to the Company and will enable Clough to implement our growth strategy .</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Looking forward, Clough is now moving into a position where the Company has a tremendous opportunity to expand in its key markets .</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The operational business has been profitable for the past 18 months and the Company will continue to focus on successful project execution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">With a recapitalisation approved by the Board, and access to additional funds , the Company will be able to implement a growth strategy that will see us gain access to growing markets that are eminently suited to our core strengths and expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">[emphasis added]
 
 (ii) CEO Comment 
 
 Clearly the past few years have been a very difficult time for the Company, but with the provisions taken we are able to isolate the prior year projects and concentrate on the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">With the refinancing package in place and a dedicated talented workforce we are equipped for growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">[emphasis added]
 
 (iii) CFO Analysis 
 
 The provisions on BassGas and G1 have been established to provide the financial environment against which both contracts can be isolated without further impacting future year's results .</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The balance will be financial from the recapitalisation proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In assessing the level of cash to be raised, we have recognised that the Company needs to reduce working capital loans currently provided by Clough's banking group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Additionally, we have proposed to raise further cash through the sale of assets which are not core to the group's focused strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">This process and the expected cash to be generated from further Property business disposals will allow the Company to regularise debt levels and provide the necessary cash resources to enable the group to respond to the growing opportunities in the oil and gas market .</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The Company has also announced its intention to upgrade the Java Constructor vessel and to acquire additional offshore work vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Our banking group maintained their support throughout the year and whilst we remain in default of our banking covenants (driven by the provisioning) the banks have welcomed the proposed recapitalisation announcement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Cash generated in the year was neutral, however agreements signed will generate net cash inflow of $31m in the current year of which $6m will pay down specific Property related debt.</sentence>

<sentence id="s385">The Company has also agreed a $25 million debt facility and a $160 million loan guarantee facility both provided by Murray &amp; Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The recapitalisation will allow the Company to deal with the cash flow issues arising from the BassGas and G1 disputes and provide the necessary support for the capital expenditure programme announced by the Company in February 2007 .</sentence>

<sentence id="s389">Events occurring after the balance sheet date
 
 No matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year, which significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the consolidated entity in periods subsequent to the year ended 30 June 2007, apart from the matter noted below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The Company announced on 12 July 2007 its intention to recapitalise the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The funding structure has now been finalised and will comprise a fully underwritten renounceable rights issue at 36.8 cents per share to raise $39.4 million and a placement to Murray &amp; Roberts at 36.8 cents per share to raise $5.6 million .</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The Company has also agreed a $25 million debt facility and a $160 million loan guarantee facility both provided by Murray &amp; Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">The recapitalisation will allow the Company to deal with the cash flow issues arising from the BassGas and G1 disputes and provide the necessary support for the capital expenditure programme announced by the Company in February 2007 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Additionally the Company announced its intention to complete the disposal of non-core assets , the details of which are being worked through.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">[emphasis added]
 
(e) Item 10 of the Directors' Report noted that DPA Singleton (former Chief Executive Officer) "resigned on 9 January 2007 and he received a termination payment of $1,237,500 which included a bonus of $337,500 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">This is inconsistent with a picture of a company in the throes of financial despair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">(f) Clough's characterisation of the statement that the subject dispute has been publicised as " assertion " is falsified by Exhibit 3 (extracts from various media reports) as well as by the evidence of Mr Simons under cross-examination, who conceded as much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">(g) Clough's statement that " what cannot be known is the extent to which Clough lost other projects because of negative publicity relating to the Bass Gas dispute " is:
 
(i) pure speculation; and
 
(ii) in any event, irrelevant --- the bad publicity and fact of the call on the performance guarantees is already widely known --- see Exhibit 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">(h) The Atradius document (Exhibit 6) referred to in paragraph 8 of Clough's submissions is entirely equivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Apart from being part of an incomplete negotiation (there were evidently telephone calls as well as other emails), the email contains the statements " We have allocated the material to cover your requirement " and " Please ensure that the client is aware that we are not looking to go back on Clough cover at this point in time ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">(i) The significance of the fact that Clough had other bond or performance guarantee facilities was not to suggest that they generated cash, but to counter the original evidence of Mr Simons that raising future performance guarantees would be threatened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">(j) Similarly, the reference to the non-withdrawal of credit approvals was to highlight the non-materialisation of the fears and concerns to which Mr Simons originally deposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">There is much force in these particular submissions of ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">On the face, of it there is, at least, a difference in emphasis between what Mr Simons, on behalf of Clough, has deposed to, on the question of the financial impact upon Clough should the Banks pay under the performance guarantees, and the position reflected in Clough's Annual Report, parts of which I have set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Referring, for illustrative purposes, to Item 7 to the 'Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement 30 June 2007', it is difficult to reconcile the statement that the "... recapitalisation will allow the Company to deal with the cash flow issues arising from the BassGas and G1 disputes and provide the necessary support for the capital expenditure programme announced by the Company in February 2007", with Mr Simons' written evidence which advances a rather less optimistic view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Nonetheless, there will be consequences and Clough may not be able to achieve all of its stated objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">I accept that the $160 million loan guarantee facility may be utilised only for Clough's vessel investments program and that payment under the performance guarantees prior to the capital raising at the end of December 2007 will adversely affect cash flow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">I also accept that provisions made in Clough's financial statements in relation to the impact or likely impact of this dispute are not certain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">They are the best estimates which Clough is able to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Against that, in cross-examination, Mr Simons conceded that Clough's capital expansion program will be secured by the Murray and Roberts funding and the recapitalisation and that there will be no need to retrench staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">This is a very different position to that which existed at the time that I refused the application of the Banks to discharge the injunction: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 2] [2007] FCA 927 at [54] - [63] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">There is no evidence to establish specific irreparable damage to Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Consequences of the kind that I have referred to are not uncommon in such matters and indeed are often the probable consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Certainly, Mr Simons accepted that such consequences, broadly, were in the anticipation of Clough when the performance guarantees were given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">REPUTATION 
 I have also considered Clough's claims that payment under the performance guarantees will adversely affect its commercial reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">As to that I accept the submissions of ONGC which derive their factual foundation from the second affidavit of Mr Simons, his cross-examination and various media reports admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The market knows of Clough's dispute with ONGC, and it has been the subject of public disclosure to the ASX by Clough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Clough's Board has told the market that it considers the claims to be "spurious" and uses public relations to protect its position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">ONGC submits that if it is the call on the performance guarantee that impacts on reputation, as Mr Simons claimed, any such impact has already occurred as that call has been publicised through the judgments of the Court and media reports (Exhibit 3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The newspaper reports refer to: 
 (a) the disputes between the parties;
 
 (b) the fact that ONGC has rejected Clough's claim for damages;
 
 (c) ONGC claims that Clough was in breach of contract;
 
 (d) Clough has been "sacked" from the Project; and
 
 (e) the fact that the Performance Guarantees had been called upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Mr Simons accepted that the market generally understands that all that is required for a performance bond to be called on is a claimed breach of contract and not necessarily an established breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">If maintenance of the injunction mitigates against a perception of ONGC's entitlement to call on the performance guarantees then, Clough submits, the corollary will be an adverse impact on ONGC's reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The call and payment of the bonds in the Bass Gas dispute which was well known to the market, has not prevented Clough from securing high value construction contracts including $265 million of new oil and gas contracts in July 2006, many of which have involved the provision of performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">There is no solid evidence of any loss of business from the calls on the performance bonds in the Bass Gas dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The only concrete illustration given in his affidavit by Mr Simons was in relation to Mitsui &amp; Co, but Mitsui's concern was not with the fact that performance guarantees were being called on, but more generally because of Clough's precarious financial position at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Clough it appears, according to Mr Simons, has excess capacity of some $5-6 million in its existing debt facilities to provide future performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Clough submits that greater damage to Clough's reputation with its financiers will flow from its breach of its various facility agreements by enjoining the Banks notwithstanding Clough's express authorisation to each of them in those agreements to pay without reference to them, and notwithstanding the fact that Clough might dispute entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">There is considerable force in that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">If anything, the maintenance of the injunctions will impair Clough's position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">In Mr Simons' second affidavit, he has said that the Banks have each advised him that they will not extend any further facilities to Clough until such time as the injunctions against them are dissolved or otherwise dispensed with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">I would in these new circumstances not accord any significant weight, in considering the balance of convenience, to Clough's concerns as to its reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">I consider, however, that significant weight ought be given to the importance in international commerce of giving effect to instruments such as these performance guarantees: e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd [1998] 3 VR 380 at 403.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">For all of the above reasons, the balance of convenience would not, subject to the consideration, should it arise as to the strength of Clough's case, favour a continuation of injunctive relief.</sentence>
