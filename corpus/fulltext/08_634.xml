1 The reasons for judgment of the Full Court in this matter were handed down and copies were given to the parties on Tuesday 29 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It is not necessary to repeat any of the matters dealt with in that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It suffices to observe that shortly after the judgment was handed down, counsel for the first respondent ("the Minister") contacted my chambers to signal that an application for non-publication of the reasons of that judgment would be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On Wednesday 30 April 2008, such an application was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I heard the application, sitting as a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 By agreement between the parties, the reasons of the Full Court, as well as the transcript and written submission relating to the hearing of that appeal, were kept confidential until the hearing of the non-publication application on 30 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At the hearing of this application, I made an interim order that the information remain confidential until the determination of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The application by the Minister is for an order that the reasons, transcript and written submissions relating to the appeal not be published until after the determination of any special leave application before the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Such an application must be filed within 28 days from the date of judgment: see Pt 41 r 41.02.1 of the High Court Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Minister seeks this order on the basis that publication of the Full Court's reasons (or the transcript or written submissions relating to the proceeding) would adversely impact the Minister's ability to obtain relevant information and thereby properly discharge his functions under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It is also said that publication may have an adverse impact on any persons giving information to the Minister to enable him to carry out those functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 Although counsel for the appellant opposes the application, he is unable to identify any significant prejudice his client might suffer if the application is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">However, he draws the Court's attention to the important public interest in transparent justice, and notes that the Full Court, in its reasons for judgment, expressly found that the information should not be treated as confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 Notwithstanding the submissions advanced by counsel for the appellant, I consider that, in the absence of any identified prejudice to the appellant, it is appropriate that the information be treated as confidential until the determination by the High Court of any application for special leave to appeal, or until the expiry of 28 days from the date of the judgment, or until any decision is made not to seek a special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Such orders are made to preserve the subject matter of any appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In making this determination, I record that I consulted with Justice Finn and Justice Besanko, and am grateful to their Honours for their comments in relation to this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 I do not consider that any order should be made as to costs of this application by the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Associate:
