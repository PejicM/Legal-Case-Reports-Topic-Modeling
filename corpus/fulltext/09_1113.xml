<sentence id="s0">
 The respondent is the owner and operator of Radio 2GB in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">According to her Statement of Claim, in 2006, 2007 and for some time in 2008, the applicant was the owner, operator and controller of a retail fish and chip shop located in Carlingford Court, a shopping mall in Carlingford, NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The shop was called Seafood Lovers .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant's husband, Emran Ahmed, worked in the shop, running the business with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">One of the talkback radio hosts employed by the respondent in 2007 and 2008 was Ray Hadley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In January 2007, Mr Ahmed indecently assaulted a 17 year old female employee who worked in the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He was subsequently convicted of aggravated indecent assault and given a 12 month suspended sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">An appeal by him failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appeal was decided on 20 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant alleges that, in the period between September 2007 and 21 May 2008, Mr Hadley referred to the actions of Mr Ahmed in a most disparaging fashion on 17 separate occasions during his talkback radio program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">These broadcasts came to a head on 21 May 2008, when the father of the 17 year old victim had a conversation on air with Mr Hadley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">A transcript of that conversation is attached to the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is not necessary to refer to the conversation in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Hadley used strong language in describing Mr Ahmed and his conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He began the conversation by referring to Mr Ahmed as the owner of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He then referred to Mr Ahmed's appeal against his conviction which had been dismissed the day before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the conversation, Mr Hadley called Mr Ahmed "this low life"; "a deviant"; "this dirty low bastard"; "this dirty filthy old bloke"; "this grubby old 44 year old"; and "this grub".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Hadley also made mention of the applicant who, according to the caller, had obtained an Apprehended Violence Order ( AVO ) against the caller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Hadley called the applicant "his grub of a wife".</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In this conversation with the victim's father, Mr Hadley urged his listeners to boycott the Seafood Lovers business if either the applicant or her husband retained any ongoing connection with that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He said that the applicant and her husband should be driven out of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">A little later on the same day, Mr Hadley again referred to the applicant and her husband on his program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">His remarks on this occasion were directed to the AVO obtained by the applicant against the victim's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He said that the world had gone mad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He suggested that it was absurd that the AVO in question had been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant says that she has been defamed by Mr Hadley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">She says that Mr Hadley conducted a vendetta against her husband and against her which destroyed the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In this Court, the applicant has sued the respondent in tort for damages for defamation, injurious falsehood, inducing a breach of contract and unlawful interference with trade and business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">She also claims aggravated and punitive damages and interest on damages in respect of those causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">If these were the only causes of action pleaded by the applicant, her case would be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">How then does this matter come to be in this Court?</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Court's jurisdiction is said to be legitimately engaged because the applicant also pleads a cause of action based upon s 60 and s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The common law actions to which I have referred are said to be within the Court's accrued jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The respondent contends that the applicant's reliance upon s 60 of the Act is simply a device or stratagem designed to enable the applicant to litigate a defamation case in this Court without a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It has applied to the Court for an order that the whole of the proceedings be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As an alternative to that order, the respondent seeks: The respondent's application gives rise to the following issues: I have come to the view that paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim should be struck out and that the proceedings should be transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Having come to these views, it is not necessary for me to consider the question of whether any issues should be tried with a jury in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Supreme Court is the natural forum for these proceedings and it will no doubt hear and determine the applicant's case according to both the substantive and adjectival law apt for a defamation suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I also decline to deal with the respondent's application to strike out the balance of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The applicant is on notice of the pleading points taken against her by the respondent in respect of the balance of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">If the parties do not come to some sensible accommodation in relation to those matters, then the respondent can re-agitate those points in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">That is the appropriate forum for those pleading points to be decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">THE APPLICATION AND THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM 
 In her Application, the applicant seeks damages, aggravated damages and punitive damages based upon the causes of action relied upon in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The allegations in the Statement of Claim may be summarised as follows: In the period September 2007 --- May 2008 the Respondent, contrary to the provisions of Section 60 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) unduly harassed the Applicant and her business and unduly harassed and coerced GPT to terminate the said lease whereupon GPT terminated the lease by reason of the said undue harassment and coercion and the Applicant was not able to supply goods to consumers and the payments for the goods by consumers were reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">By reason of the breaches of Section 60 of the said Act the Applicant suffered financial loss and damage and was otherwise seriously wounded and injured and suffered great pain of body and mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(e) The respondent wrongfully and maliciously induced GPT to breach and terminate the lease of the Seafood Lovers premises granted to the applicant and her husband; (f) The respondent defamed the applicant by broadcasting certain material, a transcript of which is annexed to the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The defamation is alleged to have occurred during the conversation which Mr Hadley had on air on 21 May 2008 with the father of the employee assaulted by Mr Ahmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That material is alleged to convey the following imputations, namely that: 
 
 (a) The Applicant is a grub (paragraphs 1, 95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">(b) The Applicant is a vile person (1, 95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">(c) The Applicant has brought a false, vexatious and frivolous Application for an AVO against a person called Glen (15-38, 95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(d) The Applicant is contemptible and should be sent out of business (95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">(e) The Applicant's conduct is disgraceful (95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">(f) The Applicant is unfit to run the business Seafood Lovers (95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">(g) The Applicant condones and does not object to the criminal conduct of her husband (1, 95, 96).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 

 
 (g) The respondent also committed the other torts referred to in [12] above; and
 (h) Damages are claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">As mentioned in [12] above, aggravated and punitive damages are claimed in respect of the causes of action based in tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 Particulars of the alleged breaches of s 60 of the Act are provided as follows: 
 
 The Respondent through and by its employee, servant and agent Ray Hadley, engaged in a campaign against the Applicant, her husband and the business "Seafood Lovers" with the intention of denigrating the Applicant and causing harm and injury to her business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">This campaign was conducted by way of radio broadcasts by Mr Hadley on 2GB on 20 September 2007 (4 broadcasts), 7 November 2007 (3 broadcasts) 8 November 2006 [sic] (6 broadcasts), 9 November 2007 (2 broadcasts) and 21 May 2008 (2 broadcasts).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In each broadcast the Respondent denigrated Seafood Lovers and harassed, coerced and made representations to GPT to cancel the lease of Seafood Lovers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In all broadcasts the Respondent made disparaging statements about the Applicant and Seafood Lovers and invited listeners to boycott the business or otherwise not deal with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 

 
These particulars are also given as particulars of the unlawful inducement of breach of contract case and the unlawful interference with trade case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Further particulars referable to the applicant's defamation case and her case for aggravated and punitive damages are also set out in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is apparent from the particulars of the alleged breaches of s 60 of the Act provided in the Statement of Claim that 17 broadcasts made by Mr Hadley in the period from September 2007 to May 2008 are relied upon in support of the applicant's s 60 case and in support of all of the claims which she makes in tort except for the defamation claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The defamation claim is confined to what was said by Mr Hadley during his on air conversation with the victim's father on 21 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">No particulars have been provided of the substance of what was said during any of the 15 broadcasts which took place in late 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">CONSIDERATION AND DECISION 
 The Case Based on Section 60 of the Act
 Section 60 of the Act is in the following terms: 
 
 60 Harassment and coercion 
 A corporation shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 

 There are some important differences between the s 60 case put in the applicant's Written Submissions and that which has been pleaded in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In his Written Submissions, Counsel for the applicant explained her s 60 case in the following way: In the submissions which I have summarised in [24] above, the applicant put forward a case of harassment and coercion of GPT and of the retail customers of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Counsel for the applicant did not articulate a case based upon harassment and/or coercion of the applicant herself in the Written Submissions filed on behalf of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Statement of Claim, on the other hand, contains allegations that the respondent: (a) Unduly harassed the applicant and her business; and (b) Unduly harassed and coerced GPT to terminate the lease which it had granted to the applicant and her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
The pleaded case based upon harassment of the applicant was relied upon by Counsel for the applicant in his oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">He also relied upon the other ways in which he had put the case in his Written Submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I do not think that the applicant has pleaded in the Statement of Claim any case based upon harassment and/or coercion of the customers of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It is true that, in par 5 of her Statement of Claim, the applicant alleges that the respondent "... unduly harassed the Applicant and her business ..." (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The second part of that allegation is ambiguous or perhaps meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It may mean that the respondent harassed the business itself by, for example, harassing employees of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It may mean that the respondent harassed the customers and potential customers of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The position is clarified when regard is had to the particulars of harassment and coercion set out in the Statement of Claim which I have extracted in full at [19] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In those particulars, Mr Hadley's conduct is characterised as " an invitation " to listeners (a description of a group or class of persons which would include but not be confined to customers and potential customers of the business) to boycott the Seafood Lovers business and otherwise not to deal with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Those particulars do not amount to an allegation that the broadcasts about which complaint is made constituted harassment of customers, let alone " undue " harassment of customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The applicant has not sought to amend her Statement of Claim insofar as the cause of action based upon s 60 of the Act is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I will, therefore, approach my consideration of the present application upon the basis that the applicant's s 60 case, as pleaded, does not involve any allegation to the effect that the respondent unduly harassed or coerced the customers of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The potential for such a case to be put will need to be considered if I need to address the question of whether the applicant should be granted leave to re-plead her s 60 case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The respondent submitted that s 60 of the Act was concerned with harassment and coercion directed at consumers, rather than at suppliers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The respondent submitted that the complaints made by the applicant in her Statement of Claim were that the respondent had unduly harassed her and had unduly harassed and coerced GPT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The respondent submitted, correctly in my view, as I have already indicated, that the applicant does not allege in her pleading that the respondent used physical force or unduly harassed or coerced any consumer or potential consumer of the products sold by the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The respondent also relied upon the fact that the conduct on the part of the respondent about which complaint is made in the Statement of Claim consists entirely of oral communications broadcast by the respondent to the public generally, via talkback radio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Dowsett J in Worchild v Queensland Television Ltd [2005] FCA 1792 at [6] made several observations which generally support the approach to s 60 reflected in the submissions made by the respondent to which I have referred at [28] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In that case, his Honour held that s 60 is intended to protect consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">His Honour also held that the conduct about which complaint is made must be in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour decided that the expression in connection with in s 60 requires a direct and close connection between the conduct complained of and the actual or possible supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At [6], his Honour said: 
 
 As to the claim pursuant to s 60 of the Trade Practices Act , the applicant has not pleaded that the alleged conduct was in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer, or the payment for goods or services by a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is likely that his case is that such supply was the delivery of news or other services by the respondent (which owns a television station) to consumers of such services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">However, that has not been pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I indicated to the applicant that he might be able to amend, but he said that he thought that it was rather a matter for particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Even if the pleading were amended, there would be a further difficulty in that the conduct of which he complains is not in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It is true that the expression, ' in connection with ' can have a very wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It is also true that the taking of film is undoubtedly a step in the process of supplying news services to consumers, if that is a correct description of what a television station does in its news broadcast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">However, in my view, the expression, ' in connection with ' in s 60 should be read more narrowly as requiring a direct connection between the conduct complained of and the actual supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In other words, conduct preparatory to supply is not sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Clearly, the section is designed to protect consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Any broader interpretation of the section would go beyond that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 

 In Worchild [2005] FCA 1792 , the applicant alleged that a news cameraman employed by Queensland Television Ltd had unlawfully entered his flat and had surreptitiously recorded pictures and sound of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In that sense, the actions of the cameraman might be said to have been conduct preparatory to the supply of news services to the public but was not sufficiently close to such supply to engage s 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">His Honour confined the scope of the expression " in connection with " in the way that he did because the interpretation given to the section by adopting that approach most appropriately accommodated the purpose of the section viz the protection of consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The respondent referred me to five decisions in this Court which it contended supported the narrow interpretation of the expression in connection with which found favour with Dowsett J in Worchild [2005] FCA 1792.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The five cases in question were: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; (2001) 114 FCR 472 at [63] and [66] (pp 486-487); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Davis [2003] FCA 1227 at [21] and [22]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd [2003] FCA 1225 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Capalaba Pty Ltd [2004] ATPR 41-976; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McCaskey [2000] FCA 1037 ; (2000) 104 FCR 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Those five decisions tend to support the proposition that the connection between the conduct complained of and a supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer must be direct and obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">However, the point was not specifically addressed in any of them and was not the subject of detailed consideration in any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In McCaskey [2000] FCA 1037 ; 104 FCR 8 , at [44]---[53] (pp 25---29), French J (as he then was) explained s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">At [44] (p 25---26), his Honour said: 
 
 [44] The elements of the conduct prohibited by s 60 are as follows: 
 
 It is the conduct of a corporation or a person to whom the extended operation of the Act applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is conduct: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer; 
 (b) in connection with the payment for services by a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is one or more of the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) use of physical force; 
 (b) undue harassment; 
 (c) coercion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 
 

 His Honour then referred to some matters of history and then gave a detailed exposition of the section at [47]---[51] (pp 26---28) with which I respectfully agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">In those paragraphs of his judgment, his Honour said: It is the second limb of the conduct defined by s 60 namely "undue harassment or coercion in connection with the payment for goods or services by a consumer" that is in issue in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The words of the section are to be given their ordinary meanings relevant to the context in which they appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The term "harass" as defined in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines from the French "harasser", a pejorative derivation of the word "harer" meaning "to set a dog upon".</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The definitions of the word are thus: 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Trouble by repeated attacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Now Freq; subject to constant molesting or persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">
 
 
 Lay waste, devastate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Tire out, exhaust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Overwhelm with cares and misfortunes etc -- Chiefly as harassed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" 
 
 
 The meaning of primary relevance here is the first, but it is important to have regard to context in considering its application in s 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In this respect judicial exegesis, in other statutory settings, of concepts such as "sexual harassment" is of little assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) does not require a demonstration of repeated unwelcome approaches: Hall v A &amp; A Sheiban Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 72 ; (1989) 20 FCR 217 at 231; [1989] FCA 72 ; 85 ALR 503 at 514 (Lockhart J), at 240; 523 (Wilcox J), at 279; 567 (French J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">And see O'Callaghan v Loder [1984] EOC 92-023 at 75,505.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">That proposition derived from the language of s 28(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Certainly it is consistent with the ordinary meaning of "harass" as involving an element of repetition to speak of a harassed state of mind arising out of one or more events: Johnson v Collier (1997) 142 FLR 409 at 412 (Anderson J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">But there, "harassed" is used in the fourth of the defined meanings and relates to the state of mind of a person induced by an event or events none of them necessarily amounting to harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">A person can feel harassed because something has gone wrong for which nobody is to blame.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 
 The word "harassment" as used in s 60 must serve two broad purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It describes a range of conduct, in connection with the supply of goods or services which involve, inter alia, applying repeated pressure to a consumer who is under no pre-existing obligation to acquire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">It also describes conduct in relation to a consumer who is under an unfulfilled obligation to pay for goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Given the range of cases that it can cover, the question whether or not there is harassment involves evaluative judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The word "undue" adds an extra layer of evaluation which is more relevant to the case of debt recovery than to the sale of goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Repeated unwelcome approaches to a potential acquirer of goods or services could qualify as harassment and, so qualified, require very little additional evidence, if any, to attract the characterisation of "undue harassment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">On the other hand a consumer who owes money to a supplier can expect repeated unwelcome approaches requesting payment of the debt if he or she does not pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">No doubt such approaches might also qualify as harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">If legitimate demands are reasonably made, on more than one occasion, for the purpose of reminding the debtor of his or her obligation and drawing the debtor's attention to the likelihood of legal proceedings if payment is not made, then that conduct, if it be harassment, is not undue harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">If, however, the frequency, nature or content of the approaches and communications associated with them is such that they are calculated to intimidate or demoralise, tire out or exhaust a debtor rather than convey the demand and an associated legitimate threat of proceedings, the harassment will be undue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Section 60 can also cover cases in which the conduct complained of lacks the element of repetition necessary to constitute harassment, undue or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This requires consideration of the term "undue coercion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The word "coercion" is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary thus: 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The action of coercing; constraint, restraint, compulsion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">
 
 
 Government by force; the employment of force to suppress political disaffection and disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Physical pressure; compression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Coercitive power or jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">" 
 
 
 The verb "coerce" is defined as: 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">To constrain or restrain by force, or by authority resting on force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">
 
 
 To subject to restraint in the matter of (rare) 1780.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">To effect by compulsion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">" The collection of debts may involve coercion in the sense that the debtor is subjected to the pressure of the demand and the legitimate threat of civil process for recovery with the additional cost and damage to credit which that can involve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Such pressure may be thought of as coercion but is entirely legitimate and not "undue".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Where the demand includes content which does not serve legitimate purposes of reminding the debtor of the obligation and threatening legal proceedings for recovery but is calculated otherwise to intimidate or threaten the debtor, then the coercion may be undue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">So if a threat is made of criminal proceedings, or of the immediate seizure and sale of house and property, a remedy not available in the absence of retention of title or some form of security, the coercion is likely to be seen as undue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The threat of criminal proceedings itself may be an offence against State laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Quite apart from content the manner or circumstances of a demand or communication, including the language used, the time and place at which it is made and the person to whom it is communicated, may go beyond the legitimate purposes of drawing attention to the existence of the obligation and the consequences for non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Again such a communication may amount to undue coercion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Obvious examples include the use of personally abusive or obscene language, conveying the demand to uninvolved family members, particularly children, or conveying the demand through a third party in order to embarrass the debtor when the debtor could reasonably have been the subject of a direct communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Each case will turn on its own facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Some useful examples of situations that may give rise to contraventions of s 60 are set out in the ACCC guidelines entitled "Debt Collection and the Trade Practices Act " published in July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">As pointed out of course that publication is not a statement of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It can only be a guide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The recovery of unpaid debts can be pursued with firmness, determination and civility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It can do all those things without resorting to bullying, bluff, misrepresentation or stand-over tactics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">If it does the first and avoids the second it is unlikely to contravene the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">His Honour did not specifically address the question of what is meant by " in connection with " in s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">At [48] (p 27), his Honour did speak of pressure being applied to a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The examples which his Honour gave were examples of pressure being applied to a consumer in that person's capacity as a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">But his Honour was not called upon to decide whether the expression " in connection with " should be construed widely, as is often the case, or narrowly by reference to the purpose for which s 60 was enacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">As the respondent submitted, correctly I think, there are only a handful of decisions in this Court which deal with s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Most do not descend into any reasoned analysis of the section because the section appeared clearly to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">There is no Full Court authority and no High Court authority on the meaning of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">I should follow Dowsett J in Worchild [2005] FCA 1792 unless I am satisfied that his Honour was clearly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I am not so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I will therefore approach the interpretation of s 60 upon the basis that the expression " in connection with " requires a direct connection between the conduct complained of and the actual or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">I consider, however, that construing the expression in this way does not necessarily mean that, as a matter of law, in every case, the harassment of which complaint is made must be harassment of a consumer in that person's capacity as a consumer and can never be constituted by the harassment of another person (who may or may not also be a consumer) directed or aimed at a consumer under actual or possible arrangements of supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The respondent submitted that the harassment of a supplier can never be conduct which is caught by s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">I am not convinced that this submission is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">I do not think I have to go as far as the respondent submits in order to decide the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In the present case, the applicant alleges that Mr Hadley unduly harassed the applicant herself, unduly harassed and coerced GPT and unduly harassed and coerced the applicant's customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Coercion involves proximate compulsion, physical pressure or force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">No facts or matters are pleaded in the present case which could conceivably be characterised as the use of coercion by Mr Hadley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Nothing has been put to me to suggest that such a complexion could be put upon Mr Hadley's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Rather, the focus of the argument was on the concept of " undue harassment ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Harassment also involves conduct directed at the person harassed in an immediate and direct fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It usually involves repetition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The assessment of whether conduct is properly characterised as harassment involves an evaluative judgment (per French J in McCaskey [2000] FCA 1037 ; 104 FCR 8 at [48] (p 27)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The word " undue " adds an extra layer of evaluation (per French J in McCaskey [2000] FCA 1037 ; 104 FCR 8 at [48] (p 27)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">To be " undue ", the harassment must be disproportionate and patently unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">These views as to the meaning of the core expressions in s 60 of the Act were supported by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Maritime Union of Australia [2001] FCA 1549 ; 114 FCR 472 at [60] ---[62] (pp 485---486).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The respondent submitted that Mr Hadley's conduct could not conceivably constitute harassment or undue harassment of GPT, the applicant or the customers of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It was submitted that the quality of his conduct just does not fit the meaning of the expression " undue harassment " as used in s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The respondent also submitted that the necessary connection between Mr Hadley's conduct and the supply or possible supply of goods or services to one or more consumers or the payment for such goods or services by one or more consumers was not pleaded and could not be pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">This second point depends to a large extent upon my accepting Dowsett J's relatively narrow interpretation of the expression " in connection with " in s 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The respondent submitted that the applicant's case based upon s 60 of the Act was hopeless and was also colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Were I to conclude that the case was colourable, the proceedings should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The essence of Mr Hadley's on air remarks was the repeated denigration of the applicant and her husband and the repeated exhortation of their customers to boycott the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">In the pleading, the applicant also alleges that, in his on air remarks, Mr Hadley harassed and coerced GPT to terminate the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Mr Hadley's broadcasts were made to those members of the public at large who were able to receive a signal from Radio 2GB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Those broadcasts could be heard by any member of the public who could receive 2GB's broadcasts and who might care to turn on his or her radio and listen to Mr Hadley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">That class of persons might well have included the applicant, officers or employees of GPT and customers and potential customers of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It might also have included other persons who, in some way, might have interacted with the applicant, her customers or GPT personnel in a way which could be appropriately described as harassment of one or more of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">This harassment by intermediaries could conceivably be attributable to Mr Hadley although such a case would be extremely difficult to plead and make good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In the present case, the applicant has not pleaded any facts or matters that would enable the Court to assess whether Mr Hadley's conduct was capable of constituting undue harassment in any of the three ways in which the s 60 case was, in general terms, put on behalf of the applicant in the submissions made by her Counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">More importantly, the applicant has not pleaded facts and matters that are capable of establishing the necessary connection between Mr Hadley's conduct and any of: (a) The termination of the lease by GPT; (b) Some conduct (as yet unspecified) engaged in by the applicant which caused the loss for which she seeks damages; or (c) The boycotting of the Seafood Lovers business by customers or potential customers of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
Nor has the applicant pleaded facts and matters which link the impugned conduct in a direct way to the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">At the very least, insofar as the case based upon the undue harassment of GPT is concerned, the applicant would need to plead that officers or employees of GPT heard the relevant broadcasts; that those personnel were repeatedly bombarded by Mr Hadley in a way that amounted to undue harassment; that, in response to Mr Hadley's campaign, GPT terminated the lease in circumstances where it was not lawfully entitled to do so; and, as a result of the termination of the lease, the Seafood Lovers business was destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">No attempt has been made to plead any such facts and matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The pleading does not make clear which of Mr Hadley's remarks were communicated to GPT, how or when they were communicated to GPT, how those remarks led to GPT terminating the lease or how the termination of the lease resulted in the loss claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The pleading does not make clear what connection (if any) between Mr Hadley's remarks and the supply of services under the lease is said to exist and thus does not enable the Court or the respondent to come to a view as to whether that connection is sufficiently close as to constitute an appropriate link for the purposes of s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Furthermore, it is obvious that GPT is not relevantly a consumer of any goods or services in the circumstances of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Rather, it is a supplier of services under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The respondent argued that the harassment or coercion of a supplier of goods or services or directed at a supplier of goods or services cannot be conduct proscribed by s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">I do not need to come to a final view on this point because the pleading is, in any event, deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Insofar as the case based upon harassment of the applicant herself is concerned, the only supply relied upon by the applicant as being the relevant supply connected to Mr Hadley's broadcasts is the supply of services by GPT under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Even if the applicant were able to plead facts and matters that would arguably show that she was directly harassed by Mr Hadley's on air remarks, she would need to confront the problem that the alleged harassment of her was not engaged in by Mr Hadley in connection with the supply of services by GPT under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">He was not putting pressure on her in relation to that supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">As with the case based upon the alleged harassment of GPT, no facts or matters are pleaded which articulate an appropriate connection between Mr Hadley's remarks and the relevant supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Furthermore, the pleading does not articulate how the harassment of the applicant herself led to the destruction of the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The potential (but, as yet, not pleaded) case based upon the undue harassment of customers and potential customers of the Seafood Lovers business suffers from similar defects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It is not sufficient for the applicant simply to refer to the broadcasts (including Mr Hadley's urgings that the Seafood Lovers business be boycotted) and to rely upon the mere fact that each of the broadcasts took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The applicant would have to allege that particular persons listened to the broadcasts, were unduly badgered and tormented by them and, as a result, boycotted the business, thus causing financial loss to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Not only does the applicant not plead such a case but, in my view, having regard both to the particulars of the s 60 case currently relied upon by the applicant in the Statement of Claim and to the undisputed facts of the matter, it would be impossible for the applicant to produce a satisfactory s 60 pleading based upon the harassment of existing and/or potential customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It seems clear that Mr Hadley urged, cajoled and exhorted the customers and potential customers of the Seafood Lovers business to boycott the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">He did not harass them, let alone unduly harass them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In the pleading, the applicant currently characterises his conduct as an " invitation " to the customers to boycott the Seafood Lovers business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The respondent submitted that the Court should be slow to curtail freedom of speech by allowing s 60 of the Act to be used to gag public discussion of matters of public concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The concept of undue harassment could, in an appropriate case, cover verbal abuse or conduct falling well short of physical interaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Indeed, the language of the section itself contemplates that the prohibition contained in the section encompasses more than the application of physical force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">However, remarks made during a radio broadcast accessible by a large part of the public would generally not generate a sufficiently direct connection between those remarks and the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer as to constitute harassment or coercion in connection with such supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Much more would usually be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">There is nothing more relied upon in the current pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The supply focussed on by the applicant in her pleading is the supply of services under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Even if that supply is properly characterised as a supply of services to a consumer, as the pleading currently stands, the remarks made in the 17 radio broadcasts relied upon do not have a sufficiently direct connection to that supply to constitute harassment or coercion in connection with that supply within the meaning of s 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The applicant's pleaded case based upon s 60 of the Act is bound to fail and should be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The potential s 60 case based upon the alleged harassment of customers is hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">I would not give leave to the applicant to re-plead her s 60 case so as to include a case based upon that subject matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">My present view is that the applicant would almost certainly be unable to plead a s 60 case based upon the undue harassment or coercion of the applicant herself or of GPT were I to grant leave to her to re-plead such a case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">She did not seek leave to re-plead such a case and appeared to be content for the Court to proceed upon the basis that she had put her best foot forward in pars 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim read with the particulars extracted at [19] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In the circumstances, I propose not to give to the applicant leave to re-plead her s 60 case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">This conclusion does not prevent the applicant from seeking to plead such a case in the future by seeking leave to amend her Statement of Claim were she minded and able to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">For these reasons, I propose to strike out pars 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim and the following words in the heading to the Particulars on p 3 of the Statement of Claim, namely, " Breaches of Section 60 TPA ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">My intention in striking out that matter is to strike out the s 60 claims in their entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Was the Section 60 Claim Colourable?</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">In Cook v Pasminco Ltd [2000] FCA 677 ; (2000) 99 FCR 548 at [15] ---[17] (pp 550---551), Lindgren J held that, because the federal claims pleaded in the case before him were hopeless and clearly untenable, those claims were not genuine and were colourable or fabricated in order to engage the jurisdiction of this Court and for no other purpose, there being no evidence to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The expressions used by his Honour in respect of the federal claims with which he was dealing were " obviously doomed to fail ", " clearly untenable " and " quite hopeless ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">In using those expressions, his Honour was seeking to convey the notions that: In Cook v Pasminco Ltd [2000] FCA 677 ; 99 FCR 548 , his Honour held, amongst other things, that toxic emissions from plants were not " supplied " by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The claim was that those emissions had been supplied by the respondents with a defect, in breach of s 75AD and s 75AG of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">His Honour had no difficulty in concluding that the claims were colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">He did so because they were very obviously untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Not every claim which is ultimately held to have failed or which is struck out as untenable would justify the conclusion that it was colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1987) 18 FCR 212 , a Full Court of this Court held that the Northern Territory and a statutory authority of the Territory were not bound by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Nonetheless, the Court held that there was accrued jurisdiction in this Court in respect of the common law claims brought against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The Court said (18 FCR at 219): 
 
 It is true that in answering questions 1 and 2 in the negative, we have determined preliminary points of law in the claims under the Act brought against the second and third respondents; and that, in consequence, there will be no further trial of those issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">But it does not follow that the Court ever lacked jurisdiction to deal with such claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Nor does it follow that the Court now loses its jurisdiction to deal with the attached common law claims: see Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [1980] HCA 32 ; (1980) 145 CLR 457 at 469, 472, 477; Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Australia) Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-795 ; 75 ALR 271 , and Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-807 ; 75 ALR 629.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">In principle, the position is no different than it would have been if the claims under the Act had proceeded to trial and had been dismissed on the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In that situation, it could not seriously be suggested that the dismissal of the claims under the Act had the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to deal with any attached non-federal claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The position may have been different if the claims under the Act had been "colourable" in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of "fabricating" jurisdiction: see P H Lane, Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution (1986), pp 367-368 and the cases there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">There is no room for such a suggestion here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The applicants' case that the second and third respondents were bound by the Act cannot be said to be unarguable; and we think it was pursued bona fide: cf R v Cook; Ex parte Twigg [1980] HCA 36 ; (1980) 147 CLR 15 per Gibbs J at 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">
 

 Those statements were entirely in line with observations to the same effect made in Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 629 at 632 and in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 415---416 (per Gummow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">In Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2000) 104 FCR 564 , after referring to Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd 18 FCR 212 , French J (as he then was) (with whom Beaumont and Finkelstein JJ agreed) said (at [86]---[88]) (pp 598---599): ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It is also the case, on authority previously discussed, that the point of law could have been determined on a motion to strike out portions of the statement of claim raising the federal causes of action against the Territory respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">In that sense it could properly have been said that the claim was not tenable as a matter of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">No relevant distinction could be drawn between the process of determining the point of law as a case stated or on a preliminary issue and determining it on a strike out motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Indeed Burgundy Royale was cited by the Full Court in Unilan Holdings Pty Ltd v Kerin at 481 as authority for the proposition that the striking out of a portion of a pleading relating to a claim under the Trade Practices Act did not thereby deprive the Court of jurisdiction to hear a related claim in negligent mis-statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">See also Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd at 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The mere fact that a claim is found not to be tenable does not of itself deprive the Court of jurisdiction in non-federal claims comprising part of the same matter.</sentence>

<sentence id="s274">The Court in such a case of course does have a limited jurisdiction to determine whether its jurisdiction is properly invoked --- Mercator Property Consultants Pty Ltd v Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1572 ; (1999) 94 FCR 384 ; Khatri v Price [1999] FCA 1289 ; (1999) 95 FCR 287.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In the ordinary course the contention that a claim is not tenable will not go to jurisdiction unless dependent upon a submission that the claim is outside jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">And indeed, within that class a claim may be untenable because its very nature denies its character as an element of any matter or controversy in respect of which the Court can exercise jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">So a proceeding based upon the proposition that the Commonwealth Constitution is invalid does not disclose a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation --- Nikolic v MGICA Ltd [1999] FCA 849.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">A claim may also be a sham reflecting no genuine controversy and therefore establishing no matter in respect of which the Court may exercise its jurisdiction.</sentence>

<sentence id="s280">The mere fact that a claim is struck out as untenable does not mean it is colourable in that sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The pleading of the s 52 claim in this case advanced the legitimate forensic purpose of endeavouring to establish a cause of action which would not require proof of a duty of care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Notwithstanding its precipitate initiation and chequered history, I am not satisfied that it was colourable in the sense that would deprive this Court of jurisdiction to deal with the matter including any non-federal claims that may form part of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">I agree with French J that the mere fact that a claim is struck out as untenable does not mean that it is colourable in the sense that it was made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The respondent accepted these propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">It nonetheless submitted that the applicant's claim was colourable because: Factors (b), (c) and (d) seem to me to be, at best, neutral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">None of them, whether looked at on its own or in combination with one or more of the others, advances the respondent's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Further, I do not think that the flaws in the applicant's s 60 claim were or are so obvious that its untenability should weigh so heavily in the balance against the applicant as to lead me to conclude that her s 60 claim was colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">There is a limited amount of authority on the correct interpretation of s 60 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">There is only one case that expressly comes to grips with the meaning of the expression " in connection with " in s 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The observations of Dowsett J in Worchild [2005] FCA 1792 were brief and made in the context of a strike out application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">I am not necessarily in agreement with one of the respondent's principal legal submissions, namely, its submission that the harassment contemplated by s 60 must be of a consumer in that person's capacity as a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The applicant was entitled to test the boundaries of s 60 for her own legitimate forensic advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">In my view, that is what she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The s 60 case was not colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I therefore reject the respondent's argument that the applicant's s 60 claims were colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The Appropriate Order 
 It follows from the conclusions which I have so far reached that, notwithstanding that I have struck out the applicant's s 60 claims, I consider that the Court has jurisdiction to deal with the remaining claims made by her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">They are all common law claims, the most dominant of which is her claim in defamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">They remain within the accrued jurisdiction of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The question which now arises for consideration is: Should this Court proceed to hear and determine those claims or should they be transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales?</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The only claim for relief made by the applicant is her claim in damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The Supreme Court can more than adequately deal with a damages claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">All of the remaining causes of action relied upon by the applicant are common law claims in tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">These are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Should the applicant seek to include a s 60 claim at some time in the future, the Supreme Court would have jurisdiction to determine that claim as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">This Court has the power to transfer the whole of the proceedings to the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">That power is specifically conferred by s 86A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Section 86A(1), (2) and (3) are in the following terms: 
 
 86A Transfer of matters 
 (1) Where: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a civil proceeding instituted (whether before or after the commencement of this section) by a person other than the Minister or the Commission is pending in the Federal Court; and
 (b) a matter for determination in the proceeding arose under Part IVA or IVB or Division 1, 1A or 1AA of Part V;
 the Federal Court may, subject to subsection (2), upon the application of a party or of the Federal Court's own motion, transfer to a court of a State or Territory the matter referred to in paragraph (b) and may also transfer to that court any other matter for determination in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">
 
 
 
 
 (2) The Federal Court shall not transfer a matter to another court under subsection (1) unless the other court has power to grant the remedies sought before the Federal Court in the matter and it appears to the Federal Court that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the matter arises out of or is related to a proceeding that is pending in the other court; or
 (b) it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the matter be determined by the other court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 
 
 
 (3) Where the Federal Court transfers a matter to another court under subsection (1): 
 
 
 
 
 (a) further proceedings in the matter shall be as directed by the other court; and
 (b) the judgment of the other court in the matter is enforceable throughout Australia and the external Territories as if it were a judgment of the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">
 
 

 The respondent accepted that, were I of the opinion that the applicant's s 60 case was not colourable but that it should nonetheless be struck out, the Court retained jurisdiction in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The respondent submitted that, in that event, the Court could and should transfer the whole of the proceedings to the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Counsel for the applicant did not really argue against transfer should I come to the conclusions hypothesised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Rather, he submitted that the proceedings should be transferred to the District Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">He did not seek to support that submission with any detailed reasons as to why that course should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">I do not propose to transfer the proceedings to the District Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">In the present case, I must not transfer the proceedings to the Supreme Court unless it appears to me that it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the matter be determined by the Supreme Court (s 86A(2)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">In this context, the expression " interests of justice " should be given a wide interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The Court is entitled to consider, in addition to issues concerning jurisdiction, remedies and enforcement: 
 
 ... adjectival matters such as the availability of particular evidence, the procedures to be adopted, the desirable venue for trial and the likely hearing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">
 

 
(per Wilcox J in Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales (1988) 22 FCR 378 at 394).</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The respondent made the following submissions in support of its application that the whole of the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court: (a) The proceeding is fundamentally a common law proceeding and, as such, is more appropriately dealt with in a State court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The dominant cause of action is the cause of action in defamation; (b) All aspects of the proceeding, including the parties, the conduct alleged and the damage suffered are connected with New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">There are no issues of a national character, nor any issues which would require consideration of the law of a place other than New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">There are no factors referable to convenience which would render a hearing in New South Wales inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">After all, were the matter to remain in this Court, the hearing would take place in Sydney; and (c) In substance, the proceeding is a defamation proceeding and, as such, is more appropriately dealt with in a State court which has specialist expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">In particular, there are important procedural advantages available should the matter be transferred to the Supreme Court, including a specialist list for defamation matters, specialist defamation case management rules and a prima facie entitlement to a trial by jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">
Were the matter transferred to the Supreme Court, the respondent would have an opportunity to elect to have a trial by jury, subject always to the overall control by the Supreme Court of whether, in fact, in any particular case, some or all of the issues involved should be tried with a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">However, there was a strong likelihood that, if the respondent wished to have a trial with a jury, the trial would be with a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">These submissions are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The interests of justice will be best served by the applicant's common law claims being tried in the court where they are usually tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">This is particularly so when, as here, the dominant claim is her claim in defamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">The circumstances of this case may be contrasted with those considered by Tamberlin J in Stalyce Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd v Cetec Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 278 ; [2002] ATPR 41-866.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">In that case, the federal claims were an important part of the case, remained on foot and, in part, involved parties not concerned with the alleged defamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">This is not to say that, were the proceedings retained in this Court, the trial would not be with a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The real point is that the Supreme Court is best equipped in terms of its procedures and expertise to hear and determine the present proceedings when sensible regard is had to the substance of the claims made in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">For these reasons, I propose to order that the whole of the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Other Matters
 Because I have decided to transfer the whole of the proceedings to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I do not need to consider whether, were the proceedings retained in this Court, the trial should be with a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">In addition to the matters with which I have already dealt, the respondent made detailed submissions in its Written Submissions directed to its application that the balance of the Statement of Claim be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Those Submissions raise pleading points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">In particular, complaint is made as to the formulation of the imputations which the applicant contends arise from the defamatory matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">In answer to some of these submissions, the applicant suggested that she might amend her defamation pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In light of the other decisions which I have made, I do not think that I should entertain the respondent's strike out application in respect of the common law claims made by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">These matters are best dealt with by the court which will be called upon to hear and determine the matter on a final basis ie the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The parties should confer with a view to resolving their differences in respect of the pleading of the common law causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">In the event that no sensible resolution is reached, it will be open to either party to make an appropriate application to the Supreme Court in respect of the pleading of those causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">I wish to make it quite clear that I have not determined the respondent's current strike out application in respect of the balance of the Statement of Claim and that my decision not to do so cannot operate prejudicially to the respondent should it wish to make a similar application to the Supreme Court in respect of the pleading of those causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Similarly, nothing I have said should affect any entitlement which the applicant may have to seek leave from the Supreme Court to amend her pleading in such manner as she may be advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">CONCLUSIONS 
 For all of the above reasons, I propose to strike out the applicant's s 60 claims, to transfer the whole of the proceedings to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and to make no other orders save an appropriate order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The several applications made by the respondent were, to some extent, made in the alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">They were advanced in a sensible and logical order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Although I have rejected the respondent's contention that the s 60 claims were colourable and declined to deal with the last group of strike-out applications made by the respondent in respect of the common law pleadings, the respondent has substantially succeeded in the applications which have been determined by these Reasons for Judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">In a letter dated 26 September 2008 from the respondent's lawyers to the lawyers for the applicant, the respondent foreshadowed at least some of the arguments which it ultimately advanced in the present applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">They contended in that letter that the s 60 claims were unarguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">They asserted that those claims had been included only for the purpose of attempting to attract the Federal Court's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">They offered to bear their own costs should the applicant discontinue the present proceedings promptly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The applicant's lawyers did not respond to that letter and the present applications were then made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Given the substantial success achieved by the respondent, I think that the appropriate order for costs is that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the hearing of the respondent's Notice of Motion filed on 9 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">I will make an order in those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The parties' costs otherwise incurred to date should abide the final determination of the proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The respondent seeks its costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">I do not think that the circumstances of the present case justify an order for costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The respondent has not had complete success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In particular, it has not succeeded in its contention that the s 60 claims were colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The debate before me was not caused by manifestly unreasonable conduct on the part of the applicant or her lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">I think that the costs should be paid on the party/party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">I certify that the preceding eighty-seven (87) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Foster.</sentence>
