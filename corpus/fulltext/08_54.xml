 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant, Mr Morrison, is a citizen of the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He first arrived in Australia on 15 March 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He was then 12 years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It appears that he did not enjoy a particularly privileged secondary education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Three years later his criminal record commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He now has 95 convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 21 August 1990 he was convicted of a charge of attempted murder and was sentenced to 7 years 10 months imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In May 2007, Mr Morrison was suddenly and forcibly detained and deported from Australia to the United Kingdom by officers acting on behalf of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Although Mr Morrison had been given considerable advance notice as to the possibility of his deportation, and had made submissions opposing it, the actual decision to proceed with the deportation and its execution were carried out swiftly, aggressively and without further notice to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">While at the airport awaiting his deportation to the United Kingdom, Mr Morrison sought urgent interlocutory relief to restrain the Minister from causing his deportation to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">That relief was declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He has now pursued this application seeking orders quashing the Minister's decision so that he may return to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He contends that both the Minister's decision and its manner of execution were unlawful and therefore beyond the jurisdiction and power of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">For reasons appearing below the relief sought can not be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The circumstances in which such relief may be granted are quite limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This case does not fall into the limited category of cases in which relief of the nature sought may be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
2 These proceedings are an application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The application is brought pursuant to s 476A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The scope for review is limited to identifiable jurisdictional errors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Errors of law which constitute jurisdictional error are the only basis on which the Court may grant relief in proceedings such as the present: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 at [63] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">3 Mr Morrison sought an urgent interim injunction to prevent his removal from Australia on 8 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That motion was heard by French J who dismissed it: Morrison v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 723.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Two days later Mr Morrison filed an application for review which has since been amended on various occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">4 The current form of the amended application for review focuses on complaints about the actions of the Minister (or the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) for the Minister) at two different times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The first is at the time of cancellation of Mr Morrison's visa by the Minister in February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The second is at a later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The second complaint is of a different and serious nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is, in essence, that the detention and removal of Mr Morrison from Australia was contrived in a special manner which was intended to preclude his ability to obtain adequate legal representation such that he was deprived, in effect, of the jurisdiction of the Court to review the Minister's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The amended application is in the following terms: 
 
 THE APPLICANT CLAIMS: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">An Order that the Respondent DO SHOW CAUSE: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) WHY A WRIT OF PROHIBITION should not be issued out of this Court directed to the Respondent prohibiting him from further proceeding to act on the decision made by the Respondent on 20 February 2007 to cancel the Applicant's visa by preventing the Applicant from re-entering Australia, and 
 
 (b) WHY A WRIT OF CERTIORARI should not be issued out of this Court directed to the Respondent removing into this Court to be quashed the said Decision made by the First Respondent on 20 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">An interlocutory Order requiring the Respondent to grant the Applicant a special purpose visa and/or to otherwise return the Applicant to Australia pending the hearing of this Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Such other Orders as the Court may consider appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 THE GROUNDS OF THE APPLICATION ARE: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Respondent's decision to cancel the Applicant's visa made on 20 February 2007 was made without jurisdiction and was not authorised by the Migration Act and is accordingly void and of no effect: 
 
 
 
 
 
 a) The Respondent, in considering the Expectations of the Australian Community and in considering that the Australian community would have some compassion for the Applicant in that he had been lived (sic) in Australia since 1977 and had a [sic] formed a de-facto relationship with Ms Maria Roberts, but the Respondent nevertheless determined that, in view of the Applicant's pattern of offending, the Australian community would expect the Applicant's visas to be cancelled and the Respondent placed great weight on this consideration, the Respondent failed to have regard to the relevant consideration that the Applicant had 4 young children, who were Australian citizens and with whom he had a close and beneficial relationship and in the circumstances the Australian community would not expect the Applicant to removed (sic) from Australia with the result that those young children would be permanently deprived of that relationship with their father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 b) There was no evidence or other material on which the Respondent could conclude that the Australian public would expect the Applicant to be now removed from Australia, alternatively such conclusion was irrational, alternatively such conclusion was reached without any proper consideration, in the circumstances where the Applicant's serious offence had occurred 17 years earlier without any attempt by the Respondent or his predecessors to then remove the Applicant from Australia and where subsequent to that offence the Applicant was the father of 4 young children who were Australian citizens with whom he had a close and beneficial relationship and in the circumstances where the Applicant's removal from Australia would have [the] result that those young children would be permanently deprived of that relationship with their father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 c) The Respondent failed to have regard to the relevant consideration that the Applicant was facing serious criminal charges in the District Court of Western Australia in relation to a trial which charges the Applicant had denied and which had been adjourned from a previous trial date and in respect of which there was a co-accused and that it was in the interests of both the Applicant and the Australian community as represented by the State of Western Australia that those charges be determined whilst the Applicant remained in Australia and was therefore available to face and defend those charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Respondent and/or his officers and/or in conjunction with the Federal Police and Western Australian Police had made prior plans to remove the Applicant from Australia without informing the Applicant of the Respondent's decision made on 20 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Applicant's arrest and detention on 8 May 2007 was violent and unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Following the arrest of the Applicant on 8 May 2007, the Respondent and/or his officers deliberately kept the Applicant from contacting any legal representative from the morning of 8 May 2007 until late afternoon on 8 May 2007 in order to prevent the Applicant from seeking a review by the Federal Court of the Respondent's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Respondent and/or his officers did not act pursuant to s 198 to remove the Applicant from Australia as soon as reasonably practical, but rather acted to remove the Applicant in circumstances where he was denied his right to seek a review by the Federal Court of the Respondent's decision to cancel the Applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Further the Applicant was denied his rights under s 256 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Applicant's removal from Australia was thereby unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK 
 
5 Section 501 of the Act deals with the refusal or cancellation of visas on character grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">These provisions and their effect have now been extensively examined by the Full Court in Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">By s 501(2) , the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test and also if the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There are two elements to s 501(2) and the second of those elements must contemplate the opportunity for the person concerned to attempt to satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">6 The character test in turn is defined by s 501(6) for the purposes of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Specifically, a person will not pass the character test if the person has a substantial criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Such a record is expressly defined by subs (7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Subsection (7) provides that a substantial criminal record is held if a person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">7 There are further provisions of the Act relevant to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By ss 13 and 14 , lawful non-citizens and unlawful non-citizens are defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">By s 13 , a lawful non-citizen is a non-citizen in the migration zone who holds a visa that is in effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">An unlawful non-citizen, by s 14 , is a non-citizen in the migration zone who is not a lawful non-citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is no doubt that at all relevant times, Mr Morrison was in the migration zone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">8 The characterisation within these descriptors has a bearing on the consequences provided for in the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">9 By s 189 of the Act, provision for detention of unlawful non-citizens is set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Relevantly that section provides that if 'an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone (other than an excised offshore place) is an unlawful non-citizen, the officer must detain the person' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">An officer is defined by s 5 of the Act to include an officer of DIAC and a member of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) or the Police Force of a State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">10 Section 193 of the Act provides:
 
 (1) Sections 194 and 195 do not apply to a person: 
 
 
 (a) detained under subsection 189(1): 
 
 
 (i) on being refused immigration clearance; or 
 (ii) after bypassing immigration clearance; or 
 (iii) after being prevented from leaving a vessel under section 249 ; or 
 (iv) because of a decision the Minister has made personally under section 501 , 501A or 501B to refuse to grant a visa to the person or to cancel a visa that has been granted to the person; or 
 
 
 (b) detained under subsection 189(1) who: 
 
 
 (i) has entered Australia after 30 August 1994; and 
 (ii) has not been immigration cleared since last entering; or 
 
 
 (c) detained under subsection 189(2), (3) or (4); or 
 (d) detained under section 189 who: 
 
 
 (i) held an enforcement visa that has ceased to be in effect; and 
 (ii) has not been a lawful non-citizen since the enforcement visa ceased to be in effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 
 (2) Apart from section 256 , nothing in this Act or in any other law (whether written or unwritten) requires the Minister or any officer to: 
 
 
 
 
 (aa) give a person covered by subsection (1) an application form for a visa; or 
 (a) advise a person covered by subsection (1) as to whether the person may apply for a visa; or 
 (b) give a person covered by subsection (1) any opportunity to apply for a visa; or 
 (c) allow a person covered by subsection (1) access to advice (whether legal or otherwise) in connection with applications for visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 
 
 
 (3)(a) If a person covered by subsection (1) has not made a complaint in writing to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, paragraph 20(6)(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 does not apply to the person, and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 (4) This section applies to a person covered by subsection (1) for as long as the person remains in immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 

11 The consequence of the detention itself, is then dealt with (relevantly for present purposes) by s 196 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">That section provides:
 
 Duration of detention 
 
 
 
 (1) An unlawful non-citizen detained under section 189 must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) removed from Australia under section 198 or 199; or 
 (b) deported under section 200; or 
 (c) granted a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 
 (2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not prevent the release from immigration detention of a citizen or a lawful non-citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) prevents the release, even by a court, of an unlawful non-citizen from detention (otherwise than for removal or deportation) unless the non-citizen has been granted a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 
 
 
 
 (4) Subject to paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c), if the person is detained as a result of the cancellation of his or her visa under section 501, the detention is to continue unless a court finally determines that the detention is unlawful, or that the person detained is not an unlawful non-citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 
 
 
 
 (4A) Subject to paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c), if the person is detained pending his or her deportation under section 200, the detention is to continue unless a court finally determines that the detention is unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 
 
 
 (5) To avoid doubt, subsection (4) or (4A) applies: 
 
 
 (a) whether or not there is a real likelihood of the person detained being removed from Australia under section 198 or 199, or deported under section 200, in the reasonably foreseeable future; and 
 
 (b) whether or not a visa decision relating to the person detained is, or may be, unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 
 
 
 (5A) Subsections (4) and (4A) do not affect by implication the continuation of the detention of a person to whom those subsections do not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 
 
 (6) This section has effect despite any other law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 (7) In this section: 
 
 
 
 visa decision means a decision relating to a visa (including a decision not to grant the visa, to cancel the visa or not to reinstate the visa).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 

12 Section 198 of the Act deals with the removal from Australia of unlawful non-citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Relevantly s 198(2A) provides:
 
 
 (2A) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an unlawful non-citizen if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the non-citizen is covered by subparagraph 193(1)(a)(iv); and 
 
 (b) since the Minister's decision (the original decision) referred to in subparagraph 193(1)(a)(iv), the non-citizen has not made a valid application for a substantive visa that can be granted when the non-citizen is in the migration zone; and 
 
 (c) in a case where the non-citizen has been invited, in accordance with section 501C, to make representations to the Minister about revocation of the original decision--either: 
 
 
 
 (i) the non-citizen has not made representations in accordance with the invitation and the period for making representations has ended; or 
 
 (ii) the non-citizen has made representations in accordance with the invitation and the Minister has decided not to revoke the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">

13 In short, as will be seen below, the Minister authorised the detention of Mr Morrison under s 189(1) of the Act on the basis that he was a non-citizen 'covered by sub-paragraph 193(1)(a)(iv)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">That sub-paragraph provides that Mr Morrison is a non-citizen because of a decision the Minster has made 'personally under section 501, 501A or 501B to refuse to grant a visa to the person or to cancel a visa that has been granted to the person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">14 Section 256 of the Act provides as follows:
 
 Where a person is in immigration detention under this Act, the person responsible for his or her immigration detention shall, at the request of the person in immigration detention, give to him or her application forms for a visa or afford to him or her all reasonable facilities for making a statutory declaration for the purposes of this Act or for obtaining legal advice or taking legal proceedings in relation to his or her immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">

15 Finally, s 476A of the Act is in the following terms: 
 
 
 (1) Despite any other law, including section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 and section 8 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 , the Federal Court has original jurisdiction in relation to a migration decision if, and only if: 
 
 
 (a) the Federal Magistrates Court transfers a proceeding pending in that court in relation to the decision to the Federal Court under section 39 of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 ; or 
 (b) the decision is a privative clause decision, or a purported privative clause decision, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review under section 500; or 
 (c) the decision is a privative clause decision, or purported privative clause decision, made personally by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B or 501C; or 
 (d) the Federal Court has jurisdiction in relation to the decision under subsection 44(3) or 45(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 (2) Where the Federal Court has jurisdiction in relation to a migration decision under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c), that jurisdiction is the same as the jurisdiction of the High Court under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 THE MINISTER'S DECISION 
 
16 On 16 February 2007, DIAC provided the Minister with submissions and annexures to enable the Minister to consider whether or not Mr Morrison's visa should be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">17 As that submission correctly records, Mr Morrison had originally been notified by mail on 4 July 2005 of the Intention to Consider Cancelling the visa held by him pursuant to s 501 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The cancellation grounds were set out in the notification and he was invited to submit to DIAC any comment that he believed to be relevant to the consideration of the issue of visa cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">A signed acknowledgment of receipt was received on 22 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">18 As Mr Morrison did not respond, another notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation was sent to him on 22 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Morrison responded by submission received on 8 June 2006 which included letters of support from Ms Maria Roberts (his fianc&eacute;e) and several friends and associates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Copies of several certificates including certificates of business registration and copies of letters in relation to Mr Morrison's complaint against police were also included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Letters of support were subsequently received from Ms Janette Bowra, his mother on 8 June 2006 and from his sister on 22 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">19 It is common ground that by February 2007 when DIAC's submission was made to the Minister, DIAC was aware that Mr Morrison had appeared in the District Court of Western Australia to answer a serious criminal charge of doing grievous bodily harm with intent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The allegation is that he shot a man in the leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The trial date in respect of that charge had been vacated for reasons not presently relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">DIAC did not refer to that charge in the submission to the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Morrison makes submissions in relation to that omission and I will refer to those below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">One matter to be clarified is that as at the date of the original notification on 4 July 2005, Mr Morrison had not been charged with this offence of unlawful wounding and therefore any response by him in relation to that charge was not possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">20 The Minister was given Mr Morrison's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It was observed that the offences which rendered Mr Morrison for consideration under s 501 of the Act were the conviction on 21 August 1990 in the Supreme Court of Western Australia at Perth for entry of a dwelling with intent for which he was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment concurrent with his conviction for attempted murder for 7 years and 10 months imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">By mid-2006, Mr Morrison had been convicted of approximately 90 other offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Reference was made to the sentencing comments of the Hon Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to the effect that Mr Morrison had acted with considerable premeditation and the nature of the assault in the course of the attempted murder was brutal and repetitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">21 The Minister also received the letter from Mrs Janette Bowra, Mr Morrison's mother, explaining that in 1990 her 17 year old niece, Janette, was allegedly killed by her fianc&eacute;, an ex-police officer, who was then 34 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Her son, being very close to Janette went 'haywire over it all in throes of grief and alcohol ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">She went on to say that her son (Mr Morrison) '... was in such a wasted state that he stabbed himself, needing nine stitches and was allowed medical treatment himself only after he signed his statement for the police'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">22 DIAC's submission to the Minister was prepared in sections, the first being under the heading of 'Consideration of Visa Cancellation' which dealt at length with the previous convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The second section was headed 'The Best Interest of the Children and dealing with Article 3.1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">There was then a further section dealing with 'Other Considerations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In this regard reference was made to the nature of the visas held, making the point that Mr Morrison was the holder of two permanent visas, a Transitional (permanent) visa and an Absorbed Person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It was explained that since 1 September 1994, s 34 of Act provides that persons who had ceased to be immigrants before 2 April 1984 and had not left Australia between that date and 1 September 1994 were taken to have been granted an Absorbed Person visa thus bringing them within the universal visa system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">These people, therefore, remained subject to the provisions of the Act and the character provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">23 The submission then focused on the degree of hardship which would be caused to the immediate family members lawfully resident in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">24 Other than by the omission of reference to the charge in the District Court, the submission itself does not appear to be under any attack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">My impression is that it was reasonably comprehensive providing both material which would invite the Minister to form a view for visa cancellation and also material to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">25 On assessment of that material, however, the Minister on 20 February 2007 considered that the seriousness of Mr Morrison's offences and to a lesser extent the expectations of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations and, therefore, having given full consideration to all of the matters he decided to exercise his discretion to cancel Mr Morrison's visas under s 501(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">26 There is one particular section of the Minister's determination which is of importance to the argument advanced for Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That section reads as follows:
 
 Expectations of Australian Community 
 
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I gave primary consideration to the expectations of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In accordance with the Government's view that is expressed in the Direction, I considered that the Australian community expects non-citizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I also accepted, that the Australian community would have some compassion for Mr MORRISON's situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr MORRISON entered Australia in 1977 as a 12 year old and has resided in Australia since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I also noted that Mr MORRISON has formed a de facto relationship with Ms Maria Roberts who has three children from a previous relationship, and that he claims to have no relatives overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">However, in view of Mr MORRISON's pattern of criminal offending and the seriousness of those offences, I believe that the Australian community would expect Mr MORRISON's visas to be cancelled and him to be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">I gave great weight to this consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 Best Interests of the Child 
 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I gave primary consideration to the best interests of the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Mr MORRISON is that father figure for his de facto's three Australian born children, and they have three children together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Mr MORRISON also has a son to a former partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 
 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Ms Roberts, Mr MORRISON's de facto spouse, stated that, should Mr MORRISON's visas be cancelled and he be removed to the United Kingdom, she would find it very difficult raising the children by herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I found, therefore, that the children would suffer hardship relating to the loss of a father figure, if Mr MORRISON is removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">On the other hand, I also found that all the children would also suffer hardship if Mr MORRISON continues to re-offend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 
 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I noted Mr MORRISON's letters of support comment that the interests and well being of his family and particularly those of the children, would be adversely affected, if he was to be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I concluded that the cancellation of Mr MORRISON's Transitional (permanent) and Absorbed Person visas and his removal from Australia would cause hardship to the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">I accepted that it would possibly be difficult for Mr MORRISON's family to cope financially and for his de facto spouse to cope with six children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I gave the difficulties these children would suffer if Mr MORRISON were removed from Australia considerable weight but noted that Mr MORRISON's criminal history and incarceration also cause him and his family hardship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 
 PRELIMINARY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION 
 
27 From the perspective of the Minister, the starting point is an affidavit sworn the day before Mr Morrison's removal, in anticipation of an injunction application by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">28 Mr Richards, Assistant Secretary of the Compliance Operations Branch of DIAC had sworn an affidavit on 7 May 2007 in anticipation of the potentiality of proceedings being issued the following day by Mr Morrison to restrain his removal from the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">That anticipation proved to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">29 The purpose of this affidavit was to outline the history and reasons behind the steps that were taken for the removal of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Mr Richards referred to DIAC records showing that Mr Morrison was born in Scotland in 1965 to citizens of the United Kingdom and that on 20 February 2007 the Minister cancelled Mr Morrison's visa pursuant to s 501(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Since cancellation of the visa of Mr Morrison, officers of DIAC had been conducting inquiries and planning his location and detention in accordance with the provisions of s 189 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He pointed to the fact that Mr Morrison had an extensive criminal history, particularly involving violence and of particular concern was his conviction in 1995 of attempted murder and a then current charge before the District Court of Western Australia in respect of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and unlawful wounding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He said that officers of DIAC had worked closely with members of West Australian Police (WAPOL) who had supplied DIAC with information based on Mr Morrison's history and a document setting out the risks in detaining him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">30 He confirmed that WAPOL had assessed Mr Morrison as posing a high risk and had advised that they had received information that he had made threats against officers of DIAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He also annexed an assessment from the Western Australia Department of Corrective Services which assessed Mr Morrison as posing a high risk in its assessment of 15 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">This evidence was adduced not as to its truth but as to the information on which DIAC and the Minister say that they reasonably relied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">31 As a result of the information received from these sources, DIAC had formed the view that Mr Morrison posed a significant risk to DIAC's officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The information was substantially more detailed than the short summary in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I stress that Mr Morrison disputes a great deal of the descriptions attributed to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">He contends that WAPOL and others have exaggerated and fabricated both their concerns and the basis of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He attributed this to long running disputes between himself and WAPOL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">32 I do not, in order to address the issues raised in these proceedings, need to determine the truth or otherwise of the assertions about the level of risk posed by Mr Morrison or his propensities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It is clear that DIAC and the Minister did receive and, in my view, reasonably rely upon the various accounts from the official sources that are referred to in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Mr Morrison was given the opportunity to comment on the substance of most of those matters in 2005 and did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">33 Although, on 28 April 2007, the Minister had written to the Western Australian Minister for Corrective Services requesting Mr Morrison be placed within a Western Australian correctional facility whilst in immigration detention, as at that stage the Minister had received no response to that request (I observe that this was only a little over a week before the events the subject of these proceedings).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">DIAC had also attempted to mitigate the risks considered to be posed by the views expressed as to Mr Morrison's propensities, by seeking approval from WAPOL to accommodate Mr Morrison in the Perth Watch House 48 hours after his initial detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">There was reluctance to hold Mr Morrison in the Perth Immigration Detention Centre which was a place of administrative detention not a correctional facility and which did not have the physical security measures or resources associated with correctional facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">34 Mr Richards observed that Mr Morrison had an extensive criminal history, a history of violent behaviour in correctional facilities, two charges of escaping legal custody and two charges of assaulting police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He was also said to be 'known' to have associations with motor cycle gangs and there was a concern that those associates may attempt to intervene in his immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">35 Despite DIAC's usual policy of allowing people to be removed from Australia with at least 48 hours notice, it was considered that because of the extraordinary nature of this case and the special risks posed by the propensities of Mr Morrison that DIAC would cause him to be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable and prior to the expiration of the 28 day period within which an application for judicial review might be lodged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">36 A Justice Intelligence Service Prisoner Risk assessment provided in confidence to DIAC informed it that Mr Morrison was a high risk of escape during movement, a risk of extreme violence, an elevated risk of self-harm, required a maximum security rating and had self-harm potential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">DIAC was advised to watch for knives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Reference was made to 'extremely violent offences' and to being 'found in possession of a home made [prison issue] key (2005), increased evidence of paranoia, previous self-harm attempted by banging his head against a wall, and heightened threat towards female staff'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">I repeat that Mr Morrison also denies many aspects of this report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">37 The report went on to observe that Mr Morrison had shown a propensity towards violence throughout his criminal career, showing little or no regard for the consequences of his actions and displaying little or no empathy towards his victims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It said:
 
 A considerable number of his crimes are preceded by the use of illicit drugs or an excess of alcohol, during these incidents and is recognised that the level of violence used by MORRISON is disproportionate to the actual criminal act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">

38 The report continued:
 
 A review of the behaviour displayed by MORRISON during his previous incarceration indicates that threats and violence towards staff and other prisoners is a common theme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">MORRISON has shown that he will initiate violence towards himself at times where he is frustrated or unable to engineer a situation to his advantage, this will include smashing his head against a wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">

39 The report expressed a view that Mr Morrison, after being arrested and awaiting deportation, would 'react in a violent manner against public officers, including prison staff and against himself through acts of self-harm'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">40 His offences were described as having commenced in 1989 and continued steadily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">They included driving under the influence, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assault, driving without a motor driver's licence, assault occasioning bodily harm, threatening behaviour, damage, further assault, assaulting a public officer, further assault, further assaulting a public officer, refusing a breathe test, resisting arrest, attempted murder, entering a dwelling with intent, assault occasioning bodily harm, assault not otherwise specified, aggravated assault, being a prohibited person on licensed premises, resisting arrest, being unlawfully on premises and a further assault charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">He had served sentences in more than a dozen different correctional centres in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">41 The reasons for his removal and the manner adopted were recorded by DIAC as being as follows:
 
 There exists a significant and real risk of the client self-harming, harming others, damage to property or the occurrence of direct external intervention to disrupt the removal as detailed below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">...
 Mr Morrison has a significant and lengthy criminal history that includes crimes of violence, including attempted murder, assault, resisting arrest and assaulting Public Officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He is currently on bail facing charges of unlawful wounding and grievous bodily harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Western Australia Police have obtained information form a credible source that Mr Morrison has indicated that, in order to avoid removal from Australia, he would rather do something really bad to be imprisoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">He is also alleged to have indicated that if DIAC tried to remove him he would harm officers at the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Morrison has a defacto spouse, children and other close relatives in Australia and no known relatives in the UK, all of which provide a strong incentive for him to seek to prevent removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Based on Mr Morrison's past behaviour, including his use of violence and access to firearms there is serious concern that he could act on the threats to harm people to avoid removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In these circumstances it is considered that providing Mr Morrison with 48 hours notice of his removal may trigger actions on his part that represent a significant and real risk of harm to other people, property, or self harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">

42 Further information from WAPOL to DIAC confirmed that:
 
 ... WAPOL are extremely nervous and would not be prepared to compromise on their risk assessment and formulated plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Scott Morrison is well known to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">They believe he has access to firearms and is already on bail due to him shooting an individual at point blank range in the leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">This incident is believed to be Gang related involving drugs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">He has made repeated threats at Police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">They believe he has the mind-set to carryout (sic) his threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">WAPOL state that an anonymous informant has advised them that Scott Morrison upon receiving his NOICC said that he will not be sent out of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">He would rather go to gaol and will kill someone to avoid removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">WAPOL believed that this is a real threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 It is believed that Scott Morrison resides with his defacto spouse (fianc&eacute; [sic] ) and has six children and step children to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Possibly one other child to a previous relationship also resides at the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">WAPOL stated that they would use the DIAC search warrant to gain entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The TRG will control and restrain Scott Morrison and use such force as they deem necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">They have indicated that they will employ tazers, if necessary, to detain him under s.189.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">

43 In relation to some of the material describing his background character and propensities, there is reference to his crimes having been preceded by the use of illicit drugs or excessive alcohol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Mr Morrison says that he accepts that his previous offences have been related to the excessive use of alcohol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">He smoked marijuana as a young man but has not done so for 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">He says he has never been involved in solvent or any other illegal drug use and has never been a member of any motorcycle or other gang and has never been involved in any gang activity, legal or illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">However, he says there has been long running antagonism between himself and WAPOL and he accepts that he has reacted badly on occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">He was upset when he believed that he was wrongly convicted and imprisoned in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He was also upset at being charged and held for approximately nine months without bail for an alleged offence of which he had no knowledge or involvement in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He says, nevertheless, that on neither occasion did he react with violence and there was no violence at all whilst he was being held in prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">He has had verbal exchanges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">He says: 
 
 I have had words with both male and female guards in Prison when I have been pushed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">It is part of Prison Life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Nothing serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">I did not at any time whilst in prison threaten to kill myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">There are at least two other persons, who have the same name as me, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">'Scott Morrison', in the WA Prison system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I am aware that at times matters relating to them have been mistakenly related to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">

44 There is also reference in the materials on which I comment below to his ownership or interest in firearms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">He denies that he has ever owned or had any interest in firearms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The only interest he has had in something that could be used as a weapon is in two ceremonial swords which are on the wall of his fianc&eacute;e's home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">45 As the day of his removal drew closer, in a situation report prepared on 3 May 2007, the status of events within DIAC was relevantly recorded as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">
 Sitrep # 2 OPERATION DUGITE --- Removal of Mr Scott Morrison from Perth to UK via commercial flight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 A further teleconference was held at 1630hrs on Thursday, 3 May 2007 to progress planning for the removal of Mr Morrison on 8 May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">

<sentence id="s238">
 MR MORRISON'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINISTER'S DECISION 
 
46 There is no doubt that the events of 8 May 2007 when Mr Morrison was suddenly detained and removed from Australia came as a complete shock to him and his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">47 Mr Morrison gave evidence in these proceedings on affidavit and was cross-examined by telephone from his present abode in the city of York in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">48 He was born in 1965.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">He had never departed from Australia from the time of his arrival in 1977 until his removal on 8 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">He has four children in Australia and says that he has a very close relationship with all of his children including his son from a previous relationship and three children from the relationship with his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Maria Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">He says that he also acts as a father figure to his fianc&eacute;e's three elder children, two girls and a boy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">49 Between February and May 2007, Mr Morrison lived at 32 Dixon Drive, Middle Swan with a male disabled friend whom he helped to look after.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">He also stayed at times at 19 Tour Place, Middle Swan with his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">At that stage he was primarily working at Metropolitan Mobile Tyre Fitter as a tyre fitter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">He was required to provide the WAPOL with his addresses and place of work, which he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">He believes that the Minister's officers were in regular contact with WAPOL and that his addresses and work address were well known from early 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">50 Notwithstanding this, he complains that he was not informed at any time until his departure from the country was imminent, of the decision made by the Minister on 20 February 2007 to cancel his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">51 Mr Morrison's fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts also came into Australia in 1968.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">She was then one year old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">She gave evidence on affidavit and was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">She was born in France but both her parents are Portuguese and until recently she was a Portuguese citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">She met Mr Morrison in early 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">She also has three children aged 20, 16 and 12 years from her previous husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">She was divorced in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">She and Mr Morrison were intending to be married in January 2007 but at that stage he was facing the charges of unlawful wounding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">She says that whilst she was satisfied there was no merit in those charges, the charges were stressful and they decided to wait until the charges were out of the way before marrying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It was intended that they would be married after the matter was originally listed for hearing in November 2006 but when the hearing was adjourned they put off the marriage until after the date at which the trial was to take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Ms Roberts corroborates the other general evidence of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">She confirms that he was an extremely close and caring father to all of his three children with her and was also very fond of his son from the previous relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">52 In 2006 Ms Roberts had assisted Mr Morrison with the response to DIAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Other than in relation to the charge pending in the District Court of Western Australia, there is no complaint as to failure to convey the substance of the response to the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">53 Her evidence was that once they had heard nothing further from DIAC after their response, that she was not particularly concerned because she had understood that Mr Morrison would have a right of review of any adverse decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, if indeed there was an adverse decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">For that reason, the events of 8 May 2007, she said, came as a complete surprise and was very shocking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">EVENTS OF AND SINCE 8 MAY 2007 
 
54 On the morning of 8 May 2007 he was with his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts in the ANZ Bank car park in Midland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">They had attended to some minor financial matters and were intending to purchase a present for their daughter, Giordan, who turned 5 years old on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">As they were walking together in the car park he noticed a car had pulled in ahead of him and a number of casually dressed males moved towards him and his fianc&eacute;e and past them on both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Without any warning, he felt sharp blows to his chest and back and excruciating pain wracked through his body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">He said he thought he was going to die.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The pain, he says, was extreme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">He was shocked and collapsed to the ground without any control over his movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">As the shock and pain subsided, he found himself facedown on the ground without being able to protect himself, bleeding from above his left eye and in pain in both knees which had been severely grazed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">He says he was initially held on the ground and told not to move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It was only then that he realised that the people were police or similar officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He was handcuffed and informed that all would be explained to him shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He was in a state of shock and was dazed and confused at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">As he was held and handcuffed he noticed two men removing, what he says, were four separate barbs and wires from his shoulder and chest regions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Prior to the attack he had not been challenged or spoken to by anyone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He now knows that the pain was the result of being struck with tasers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">55 Mr Morrison was taken to the steps of a nearby building where he was treated for the cut to his head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">At that stage he was informed that he was an illegal alien and that his visa was revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">He was taken to his fianc&eacute;e's home where some clothes were taken for him and he was told that he would be taken to the Midland Police Station and from there either to the Perth Immigration Detention Centre or to the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In cross-examination, at least at one point, he accepted that he may have been told then or at some stage that he might be removed from Australia as soon as practicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">He did not think however that this would be before he had some access to legal representation and time to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">56 There was also a dispute as to whether or not he declined an offer to make a phone call at this stage for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">When he arrived at the Midland Police Station he was again told that he would shortly be transferred either to Perth or Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">He says he was offered a phone call at the time of his arrival at the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">As he was still in shock and as he had recently left his fianc&eacute;e at her house he did not believe there was any immediate urgency in contacting her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">He was given no indication, he says, that he was about to be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">He declined the offer saying he would wait until he was at the Perth Detention Centre before making a call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">57 He was left, he says, in a cell at the Midland Police Station for about an hour or two and during this time he repeatedly asked for the opportunity to smoke a cigarette because he was so stressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">He was permitted the opportunity to smoke four cigarettes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">On the second occasion and because he had been held for some time he says he also asked if he could make a phone call to his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">His evidence was that he was told by the police officer who took him for the cigarette that he had been instructed that he was not to be allowed to make any phone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">This evidence is disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">58 The immigration officer, who Mr Morrison now knows to be Mr Battersby, returned at a later time and told him that he was going to be sent to London on a plane in a couple of hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Mr Morrison asked to make phone calls to both his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts and to his lawyer whom he hoped could take steps to prevent his removal from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">He says he was told that he now had no right to make any phone calls as he had refused the earlier offer to make a phone call and that he had no legal rights in Australia as he was now in the country illegally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">He says he received this information at about 1.00 or 2.00 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">This evidence as to the phone calls is also in contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He remained at the Midland Police Station for at least an hour or probably longer after receiving that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">In the course of this time, he says Mr Battersby produced a large pile of paperwork and asked him to sign and date it to confirm that it had been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Mr Morrison signed the paperwork as requested but did not see that paperwork again until he arrived in London on the following morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">He says that he raised queries with the immigration officer concerned but was repeatedly told that the officer could not provide him with any information and to do so would be in breach of his duty not to divulge any information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">He says 'he continued to refuse to allow any phone calls'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Again this evidence is denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">59 Mr Morrison says he was returned to the cell at Midland Police Station and as he was being taken there he overheard the immigration officer say to another person in the station that he was not to be allowed any phone calls until he had started boarding the plane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Again this evidence is disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">60 Subsequently he was taken from the Midland Police Station to the Perth International Airport and only ten minutes before the flight was due to board was he allowed to make a phone call to his fianc&eacute;e to explain to her what was happening to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">He said that he believed that she then took steps to obtain an urgent injunction but it was too late to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">From the time he left the Midland Police Station until boarding the flight to Bangkok, he was restrained in handcuffs and leg cuffs, both in turn chained to a leather waistband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">During the flight from Perth to Bangkok he continued to be restrained in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">However, at Bangkok he says the Thai authorities insisted that his treatment was inhumane and they would not allow him to fly in that condition from Bangkok to London.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">He says the Australian Immigration and Securities officers agreed to remove the handcuffs and other restraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">(The reason for the removal is also denied but little turns on this issue).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">At no time during that flight or at any time from when he was struck by tasers at the Midland Shopping Centre and taken into detention did he take any steps to resist in any way or make any threats of any type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">61 Mr Morrison now knows that the charge of grievous bodily harm laid against him in the Perth District Court has been discontinued by the Western Australian Director of Public Prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">However he has been advised that he could be recharged at a future time and says that he believes that he should have been allowed to defend himself against the charge and to clear his name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">62 His arrival in the United Kingdom, he says was widely publicised including allegations that he was a 'crime lord' and that he had served time for 'kneecapping a rival gang member'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">He has been very depressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">He moved from Scotland, where the publicity was significant, to Yorkshire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">63 Mr Morrison maintains contact with his fianc&eacute;e in Perth by telephone contact as best he can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">He is aware from that contact that she and the children are suffering a great deal as a result of his continuing absence from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">He wishes to return to Australia and to be reunited with his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">64 Ms Roberts describes the events of 8 May 2007 in similar terms to those expressed by Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">She says that the officers took Mr Morrison away and took her house keys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">She was directed that she could not leave until they were ready to leave with Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">She waited until they were ready and then drove home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The officers followed her to her house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">An immigration officer produced a search warrant at the house and they took Mr Morrison into the bedroom and then left with him and she was informed that he was being taken to the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">She said she telephoned Mr Morrison's mother, Mrs Bowra and attempted to phone Mr Morrison's lawyer who had been retained on the unlawful wounding charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">She was eventually able to speak to him about lunchtime and he gave the name of a lawyer who he said specialised in immigration matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">She was first able to speak with that lawyer at about 2.00 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">She was advised by the lawyer at that stage that there was no need for concern as there was 48 hours within which to obtain an injunction and that she could apply for the injunction the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">She then attempted to contact Mr Morrison by phone and on telephoning the Midland Police Station, at about 1.00 pm, she was told that there was no record of Mr Morrison being at the Station and to call back later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">She was aware also that Mr Morrison's mother was ringing and trying to make contact with him so she did not pursue further attempts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">65 By mid-afternoon Ms Roberts received a phone call from a female immigration officer to say that Mr Morrison had been offered the opportunity to telephone her but that he was too distressed to accept the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">She says that she was later told by Mr Morrison that he had repeatedly begged to be allowed to make a phone call to her but his requests had been declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">66 Shortly before 5.00 pm on 8 May 2007 she received a call from the same female immigration officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">She confirmed that Mr Morrison was 'ok', Ms Roberts said that she wanted to speak to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">About ten minutes later she received a call from Mr Morrison to say that he was at the airport and was being taken on board a plane to the United Kingdom which was due to leave very shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">She asked him whether he had spoken to any lawyer and he said that he had not been allowed to as he had no rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">He said he had been locked up at Midland and he went straight from there to the airport and had not been permitted to speak to anybody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">She then organised for urgent representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">As it transpires, the departure of the flight was delayed which enabled the urgent interim injunction application to be heard (but declined) by French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">67 Ms Roberts says her children have suffered greatly as a result of Mr Morrison being removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">They cannot understand what has happened and how it is he could be taken from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">This evidence may readily be understood and I accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">68 Mr Morrison's mother is Mrs Bowra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">She is an Australian citizen and, of course, came to Australia in 1977 with her three children, namely, Mr Morrison and his two sisters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">It was at 11.00 am on the morning of 8 May 2007, when she was babysitting one of her daughter's sick children when she received a phone call from Ms Roberts concerning Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Ms Roberts was understandably very upset and explained that Mr Morrison had been attacked in the street by people whom she thought were police officers and that he had been tasered and pushed to the ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Mrs Bowra said that she was in shock for a while and did not know what to do but they agreed to contact the counsel who was acting for Mr Morrison in the unlawful wounding charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">69 In addition, Mrs Bowra telephoned the Midland Police Station to ask where her son was and was informed by the woman answering that she did not have any information and that she would put her through to another department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Again, another woman answered and explained that they had no information concerning an arrest of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">She telephoned several other WAPOL locations but without any helpful information at all being forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">When she telephoned the Midland Police Station again later in the day after several other attempts to trace Mr Morrison, she was informed by a female person 'happily and immediately' that Mr Morrison had gone but she said that she did not know where.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">70 From the foregoing description by the witnesses for Mr Morrison and by Mr Morrison himself, one can readily understand their alarm at the process which had been adopted and their suspicion and concern that the three of them were deliberately not informed of Mr Morrison's impending and imminent departure from Perth on a flight which, as it transpires, had already been booked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">71 As observed by French J in Morrison [2007] FCA 723 at 23, if it were the case that the removal was effected precipitately in order to deprive the applicant of access to the Court then that may constitute a collateral purpose outside the proper exercise of the power to detain and remove.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">In short it would be a very serious matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">However, before it is possible to reach any conclusion on that possibility, it is necessary to examine the evidence on the other side of the ledger for the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">ACCOUNTS BY OFFICIALS OF THE EVENTS UP TO AND INCLUDING 8 MAY 2007 
 
72 Mr Richard Battersby is the Assistant Director of the New South Wales Section 501 Taskforce of DIAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">On about 3 May 2007 he was appointed the Escort Group Commander by Peter Richards, the Assistant Secretary of the Compliance Operations Branch of DIAC with overall responsibility for the removal of Mr Morrison to the United Kingdom once he had been located and taken into immigration detention by officers of WAPOL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">On the same day, the Secretary of DIAC issued him with a search warrant and at approximately 9.40 am on 8 May 2007 WAPOL informed DIAC that Mr Morrison had been sighted in a vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">At about 10.00 am, WAPOL informed DIAC that Mr Morrison was in custody and that they were conveying him to the premises of 19 Tour Place, Middle Swan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">On being advised of Mr Morrison's custody by WAPOL he traveled from the office of DIAC in Perth to the 19 Tour Place address together with DIAC officers' Ms Faith Fabbro and Mr Stephen Reynolds, both of whom also gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">They arrived at that address at 10.50 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">73 Mr Battersby and Mr Reynolds left the vehicle and he made arrangements with Ms Fabbro that he would call her on her mobile phone once they had completed their execution of the search warrant so that she could return to collect Mr Reynolds and Mr Battersby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">At about 10.51 am he informed Mr Morrison that his visa had been cancelled by the Minister and that he was now in immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">He served him with a Notice Of Visa Cancellation dated 28 February 2007 and a copy of the Minister's Statement of Reasons for the decision of that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">I will come to these in more detail later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">74 Mr Morrison then asked Mr Battersby what was going to happen to him, Mr Battersby says he informed him that he would be conveyed to the Midland Police Station and from that location he might be transferred into the national detention centre network, either the Perth or Villawood Immigration Detention Centres or he would be removed from Australia as soon as practicable pursuant to the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">He advised of matters dealing with his post-arrival care in the United Kingdom and all of the possible courses of action as he considered it was highly likely that Mr Morrison might seek an injunction preventing his removal from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In other words, Mr Battersby's evidence is that at this stage, at approximately 11.00 am on 8 May 2007 he was conscious that it was open to Mr Morrison to attempt to obtain an injunction and that he may have been able to obtain an injunction restraining DIAC or the Minister from removing Mr Morrison from the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">75 Mr Battersby said that Mr Morrison requested his partner to pack his suit, heavy black jacket and warm clothing evidently, in an expectation that at some stage not too far removed, Mr Morrison would be in a cold climate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Mr Battersby says that he also asked at this stage if he wished to make a telephone call but Mr Morrison declined the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">76 Mr Battersby said he then proceeded to execute the search warrant at the premises and search for documentation to formerly identify Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Morrison was then taken by WAPOL to the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">He arrived there at approximately 11.20 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Mr Battersby traveled there separately in a vehicle driven by Ms Fabbro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">At the Midland Police Station Mr Morrison was placed in an interview room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Mr Battersby said he again asked Mr Morrison if he wished to make a phone call but he again refused the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">77 At about 11.45 am, Mr Morrison was seen by a nurse in relation to the cut over his left eyebrow when he fell to the ground following his detention by WAPOL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Half an hour later, Mr Morrison was taken by WAPOL officers to the lockup area of the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Mr Battersby said he waited outside the lockup area while the nurse conducted the fitness to fly assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">She concluded her assessment, he says, at around 12.00 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">78 There was then a meeting and discussion between Mr Battersby and WAPOL officers concerning ongoing security arrangements for Mr Morrison for the next 45 minutes until approximately 1.00 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">He says, that at this time he also discussed the ongoing operation with the national office of DIAC and that at all times he accompanied Mr Morrison when he was moved around the Midland Police Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">At 1.08 pm, he says he advised Mr Morrison that he was to be removed from Australia later that day and he served him with a removal notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Mr Battersby says he also advised him that DIAC would look favourably at providing a removal/reuniting package for his family if he agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Mr Morrison, he says, agreed to allow consultation with his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts by DIAC and signed the removal notice which simply had the effect of acknowledging its receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">79 Mr Battersby says he then discussed with Mr Morrison the logistics of his removal and to where he wished to travel in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Mr Morrison said he wanted to go to Glasgow, Scotland and to his father's address in Irvine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Mr Battersby agreed that DIAC would provide accommodation for him in Glasgow and his travel to Irvine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Mr Battersby said Mr Morrison appeared to be pleased with these arrangements and said that he would be compliant during the removal process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Mr Battersby was not, he said, aware of any instruction being issued by any officer of DIAC to WAPOL that Mr Morrison was not to be allowed to make any phone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He says that he certainly provided no such instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">He also denies that Mr Morrison made any request to him to be allowed to make a phone call to Ms Roberts or to his lawyer after Mr Battersby had informed him that he was to be removed and had served him with the removal notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">He also denies informing Mr Morrison that he now had no right to make any phone calls and that any legal rights in Australia had been foregone as he was now there illegally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">He says that if Mr Morrison had asked him if he could make a phone call to Ms Roberts or to his lawyer he would have arranged for him to be able to make such calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">80 At about 1.30 pm, Mr Battersby left Mr Morrison and organised for arrangements to be made for further travel to Glasgow and Irvine and for his accommodation in Glasgow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">At the same time he briefed the national office of DIAC in relation to events and spoke with officers of WAPOL in relation to the custody transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">He spoke to the AFP in relation to the custody transfer of Mr Morrison from WAPOL to the AFP on arrival by Mr Morrison at the Perth International Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">He says he did not see Mr Morrison or give any further documentation to him to sign from the time he left him at approximately 1.30 pm until returning at approximately 3.20 pm and that at no time during the period after informing Mr Morrison that he was to be removed from Australia, until he left the Midland Police Station at about 3.32 pm did Mr Morrison make any request of Mr Battersby to make a phone call either to his fianc&eacute;e or any legal representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">81 At 3.20 pm Mr Battersby attended Mr Morrison in the holding cell and gave him a full briefing in relation to his removal and post-arrival care in the United Kingdom including accommodation and arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">He explained that he would be accompanied by an escort group consisting of eight AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Mr Morrison, he says, was placed into high risk security restraints by WAPOL prior to his departure from the holding cell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">At about 3.32 pm, Mr Morrison was taken by WAPOL from Midland Police Station to the airport where he arrived at about 3.54 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Mr Battersby was in the same vehicle for that trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Morrison was transferred to an AFP vehicle which was stationed in the terminal tunnel and at about 4.40 pm he was again offered the use of a telephone which he accepted and he requested that his fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts be called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Mr Battersby says he telephoned Ms Roberts following which Mr Morrison spoke to her for about four minutes until he terminated the call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">82 At about 4.48 pm, airport security attended and conducted pre-boarding checks of Mr Morrison and the escort group which in addition to the eight AFP officers included Mr Battersby and another DIAC officer, Mr Stephen Reynolds and the nurse, Ms Robyn Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">At about 4.55 pm, Mr Morrison and the escort group were taken to the rear exit door of the Thai Airways plane on which Mr Morrison and the escort group were traveling to Bangkok.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">They boarded and Mr Battersby reminded Mr Morrison of the levels of behaviour required while he was in custody during the journey to the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">\
 
83 As it transpired the departure of the flight was delayed due to a repair being performed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The flight left shortly after 6.43 pm and landed at Bangkok at 1.15 am on 9 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Mr Battersby confirms Mr Morrison's account that Thai security advised that the flight captain of the Thai Airways flight to London would not approve the flight's departure if Mr Morrison remained in restraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">However, Thai security also advised that if Mr Morrison became disruptive or threatened the security of the aircraft, the captain would consider the reapplication of the restraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The restraints were removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Prior to that, Mr Battersby advised Mr Morrison that any changes in his behaviour or any threats of harm to himself or others would not be tolerated and it would require the reapplication of the high risk restraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">84 Following arrival in London, at 2.45 pm, Mr Morrison and the escort group were met by uniformed and plain clothed members of the United Kingdom Police service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Mr Battersby provided a brief and handover to a detective with the Violent Crime Directorate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">That detective advised he would provide Mr Morrison with a contact number for Prisoners Abroad and brief them to establish a contact with Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The detective also confirmed that he would assist to ensure that Mr Morrison caught his flight to Glasgow and would inform the authorities in Glasgow of any possible self-harm issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">85 In cross-examination, Mr Battersby conceded that DIAC had put in place a very expensive operation (including flying over ten officers with Mr Morrison and booking out the last six rows of an international flight).</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The intention was that they should fly out of Australia the same day that Mr Morrison was detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">But he also observed that DIAC had alternative arrangements in place if Mr Morrison's health was such that he should not fly or an interim injunction restraining his removal had been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">86 There were differing views as to the point of time at which Mr Morrison should be specifically informed of his impending departure that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">This was an issue on which counsel for Mr Morrison placed some emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">It was suggested but denied that Mr Morrison had been deliberately misled on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">87 Mr Battersby swore a further affidavit which was filed and served very shortly prior to the hearing and beyond the date for which directions had provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The affidavit annexed a running sheet constituting running and contemporaneous notes of the events which took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">While I allowed the affidavit into evidence, subject to any further application that might be made as a result of prejudice it may cause, it is now clear that obviously Mr Morrison has not had an adequate opportunity to comment on the running sheet which constitutes some 13 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Some entries contain a reasonable amount of detailed information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">In the circumstances I consider that the potential prejudice in relying upon the material in the running sheet is obvious and I do not propose relying on it in any way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">88 Mr Stephen Reynolds is presently the Manager of the Client Service Training Unit in DIAC at Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">He was formerly the Assistant Manager of the Compliance Counter Operations in DIAC's office in that city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">His involvement in relation to Mr Morrison starts on Wednesday, 2 May 2007 when he was requested to assist with the removal of an unidentified, unlawful non-citizen from Perth to the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The following day he was appointed Deputy Escort Group Commander to assist Mr Battersby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">His evidence was essentially corroborative of the evidence of Mr Battersby, albeit given in his own words and touching on the following additional evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">89 Mr Reynolds gave evidence of a discussion in his presence between Mr Battersby and Mr Trevor Evans, Officer-in-Charge of Midland Police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Mr Battersby stated that he had been instructed to tell Mr Morrison of his pending removal later that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Mr Evans responded saying that it was the assessment of the police that Mr Morrison would become violent when told of his removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Due to a two hour delay before Mr Morrison was due at the Perth International Airport, Mr Evans requested that DIAC delay advising Mr Morrison of his removal for the safety of police and for Mr Morrison himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">He had prepared some notes on that topic and produced the notes under an entry adjacent to the time 12.30 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Those notes read:
 
 Fitness to travel signed 
 
 Advised to tell of removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Assessment by police that he will become violent when told.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Due to two hour delay before tpt to Airport police requested we delay advice for safety reasons to police and the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">

90 There was another discussion at 12.55 pm between Mr Battersby and Mr Evans regarding the service of the removal notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">On this occasion, Mr Evans told Mr Battersby that he would ask DIAC to remove Mr Morrison from the police station if he, Mr Morrison, was told of his removal at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Mr Reynolds notes also confirm this discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">91 Finally, at 1.08 pm, Mr Reynolds attended the cell area with Mr Battersby and a number of police officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Mr Battersby entered the cell area and Mr Reynolds remained at the door just outside the cell within hearing distance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Mr Battersby then advised Mr Morrison that he would be removed from Australia later that day and served him with the removal notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">He also advised him that DIAC would assist with a reuniting package for his family if he wished to have it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">He then discussed the process of the removal with Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Mr Battersby asked Mr Morrison if he wanted to make a phone call, Mr Morrison said he did not want to make the phone call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">92 Ms Faith Fabbro, Acting Manager of the Removals Branch of DIAC, gave evidence that in instances where DIAC intends to locate an unlawful non-citizen, its usual practice is to first conduct observations on the premises for the purpose of risk assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">This is conducted in order to assist DIAC to determine the appropriate number of officers that may be required to carry out an operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">WAPOL, with the assistance of its Tactical Response Group (TRG), was charged with the tasks of conducting the location and initial detention of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">She said that at about 4.00 pm she rang Ms Roberts at the request of Mr Battersby from DIAC's office at the Perth International Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The purpose of the call was to inform Ms Roberts that Mr Morrison was being removed that afternoon to the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Ms Fabbro informed her that if she and the children were interested in relocating to the United Kingdom, she could make a request in writing to DIAC seeking assistance to relocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">She did not make a second call to Ms Roberts and there was no other female officer involved in the operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">She did, however, make two calls to Ms Roberts on 9 May 2007 following the removal of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">She had never spoken to Mrs Bowra or anyone else from Mr Morrison's immediate family on 8 May 2007, apart from the phone conversation with Ms Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">93 In the meantime during the period following the February decision of the Minister and the 8 May removal, WAPOL officers were also assisting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Detective Antonio, on 22 March 2007, at the direction of Detective Evans who was in charge of WAPOL side of the operation, prepared a report for internal purposes and for DIAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">It assessed Mr Morrison, for much the same reasons as other reports, as posing a high risk and on that basis Detective Evans engaged the assistance of the TRG to apprehend Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">He confirmed that tasers were utilised without warning and that Mr Morrison received a gash above his eye when he fell to the ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">He said that the use of tasers in that manner is a standard method of apprehension utilised by the TRG in circumstances where the person to be apprehended is or has been assessed as posing a high risk to the safety of members of the community and/or officers involved in the apprehension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">94 Detective Evans also confirmed that he could recall that Mr Morrison was offered a phone call by one of DIAC's officers when he was at the premises of Ms Roberts but that Mr Morrison having received that offer declined it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The memorandum prepared by Detective Antonio on which reliance was placed, was not admitted for the truth of its contents but simply as proof of the information received and on which there was reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">In that report it is stated:
 
 Morrison has an extensive criminal record starting as a juvenile in 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">His record comprises of numerous Burglary offences, Assaults, Resisting Arrest and minor drug charges as well as numerous Assault Public Officer convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">He spent short periods in detention until 1990 when he was convicted of Attempted Murder and was sentenced to 7 years and 10 months imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">

95 Detective Senior Constable Beverley also gave evidence as to the handling of Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">He also rejected the evidence of Mr Morrison that on no occasion was any statement made to Mr Morrison to the effect that he was not allowed to make a phone call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Nor had he received any such instructions to that effect, nor was he aware of any such instruction being issued by any DIAC officers to any other police or TRG officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">THE ARGUMENTS 
 
96 As explained, the arguments advanced for Mr Morrison essentially fall into two categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Grounds 1(a), (b) and (c) of the application challenge the lawfulness of the decision to cancel Mr Morrison's visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Ground 2, however, challenges the lawfulness of the steps taken to remove Mr Morrison from Australia following the decision to cancel his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">At the hearing, counsel for Mr Morrison did not pursue ground 1(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">It remains to consider the other two grounds in relation to the lawfulness of the decision to cancel Mr Morrison's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">97 It was clear that there was no dispute that Mr Morrison, by reason of his extensive criminal record, was deemed to be not of good character within the test provided under s 501 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">It follows that the Minister clearly had the power to cancel Mr Morrison's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">98 The essential argument was that the power to cancel is a discretionary power and the discretion can only be exercised in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">There were two primary contentions in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">99 The first was that the Minister had failed to take into account the interests of the children within his assessment of the expectations of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">100 The second was that the Minister did not have before him the information of the pending charge before the District Court of Western Australia in respect of which it is said that Mr Morrison 'sought to clear his name'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">101 The approach taken on the first point was that in the reasons of the Minister, he recorded that he gave three matters primary consideration and divided those into the headings of 'Protection of the Australian Community', 'Expectations of the Australian Community' and 'Best Interests of the Child'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The Minister specifically noted that he placed 'great weight' on his belief that the Australian community would expect Mr Morrison's visa to be cancelled and for him to be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Indeed on his reasons, that was a matter to which he gave greatest emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Other factors were referred to as having considerable, moderate or little weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">102 However, in reaching this belief as to the expectations of the Australian community, it is said that the Minister acted without any evidence or without any consideration of the diversity of views of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">Secondly and in particular, it is said that the Minister did not take into account that many, if not most, would think that it was wrong to remove a long-term resident who had committed a very serious offence as long ago as 17 years but had been allowed to remain in Australia ever since that time and who in the last six years had become a family man with three young children under the age of 5 years for whom he cared and supported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">At the same time it is said, that during that period, there was only one conviction in respect of which he received a sentence of six months imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">103 It is said that while the Minister recognised that the cancellation and removal from Australia would cause significant hardship to Mr Morrison's children, he failed to take into account that this was a factor which would inevitably affect the expectations of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">The greatest emphasis in this argument was on the interests of the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">104 'The Expectations of the Australian Community', as observed by French J in Preston v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCA 107 at [23] that term which is used in Ministerial Direction No.21 '... invites a judgement akin to judgments about the "public interest" which is necessarily evaluative and conclusionary in character and not amenable to challenge or judicial review on its merits'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">105 Similarly the Full Court in M238 of 2002 v The Honourable Phillip Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 260 at [59] said:
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">However, the "expectations of the Australian community" is fundamentally a political notion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The Minister, as the member of the Executive responsible to Parliament, of which he is an elected member, is charged with the assessment of this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">It is not a question for decision only upon evidence placed before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">The Minister may consider the views of others (...); but, ultimately, the Minister's views as to what are the "expectations of the Australian community" are reflective of a political judgment by an elected Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">

106 As the Full Court observes, the nature of the assessment being of a political evaluation, the range of resources to which reference may be had in order to exercise the discretion is not only wide but may well exceed the precise material contained in the submissions before the Minister or in the reasons expressed by the Minister for arriving at that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">107 I consider there is a further difficulty with the argument advanced for Mr Morrison on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Although it is true that in the Minister's decision, the interests of the children were recorded under a separate category or heading which immediately followed the category headed 'The Expectation of the Australian Community', it is unrealistic, in my view, to suggest that the Minister totally divorced his mind from the interests of the children when considering the expectations of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Indeed, that the Minister turned his mind to interests of at least some of the children is evident on the terms of the passage headed 'Expectations of the Australian Community'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">It is impossible to say, in my view, that the Minister did not take into account this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Equally it would be very difficult to conclude that by considering it in a separate category as suggested for Mr Morrison, he had erred in the exercise of his discretion in a way which was susceptible of judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">108 It seems to me that in the absence of clear error demonstrable from the face of the record, what Mr Morrison is, in substance, challenging by virtue of these grounds is the merits of the Minister's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Such a challenge is clearly not open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">109 In Pull v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 20 at [42] a similar claim was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">The applicant in Pull considered that the Tribunal (the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) had not given genuine and proper consideration to the expectations of the Australian community because the Tribunal member did not refer to certain matters including that the applicant had 'two daughters who are Australian citizens and there is no evidence to suggest that they will ever be able to renew their relationship with the applicant'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">At the time that those proceedings were commenced, s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) did not (by reason of s 483 of the Act) apply to a privative clause decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Therefore, it followed that to succeed the applicant was required to show that the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">As observed by Besanko J at [43]:
 
 There can be no doubt that the Tribunal member considered the expectations of the Australian community and it does not follow that simply because he did not mention or place emphasis on particular matters identified by the applicant that he failed to give the matter genuine and proper consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">

110 Similarly, in the present situation there is no doubt that the Minister was aware and recorded the fact that Mr Morrison had children and stepchildren and in considering the matter of the best interests of the children he recorded that the children would suffer hardship relating to the loss of a father figure and that his removal from Australia would cause hardship to the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">He recorded that it would possibly be difficult for Mr Morrison's family to cope financially and for Ms Roberts to cope with six children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">As in the case of Pull [2007] FCA 20 (in relation to the Tribunal), the Minister clearly took into account the hardship relating to Mr Morrison's children and clearly gave genuine consideration to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">111 Ground 1(b), if not expressly abandoned was certainly not pursued at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">As I perceived it, Mr Morrison appeared to acknowledge through counsel that as in the case of M238 of 2002 [2003] FCAFC 260 at [59] and as had also occurred in Pull [2007] FCA 20 , while the Minister did not have specific evidence before him as to the expectations of the Australian community in relation to the factors outlined in these grounds, nevertheless, the Minister formed his own evaluative judgement as he was entitled to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">It was not necessary for the Minister to make specific reference to every item which Mr Morrison would wish the Minister to record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Further, it does appear to me in substance again that this is an attack on the merits of the decision rather than a ground of judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">112 Ground 1(c) was certainly advanced seriously at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">But in my view it was also without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">I would accept that ground 1(c) on its face did appear to set up a better basis for judicial review as distinct from merits review but the suggestion that the Minister should have had regard to the fact that Mr Morrison was facing serious criminal charges in the District Court of Western Australia is in itself unsustainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">It is common ground that Mr Morrison was facing further serious charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">It is also common ground that this factor was not put before the Minister and so the Minister was unable and, therefore, did not take it into account in reaching his conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Where the argument breaks down, in my view, is the suggestion that such material should necessarily have been put before the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">The argument for Mr Morrison is that he was so keen on 'clearing his name' that the decision would have had to have been deferred so that Mr Morrison could have had the opportunity to 'clear his name' in relation to those charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">113 Mr Morrison says that the charge of 'doing grievous bodily harm with intent' is said to have been based on an allegation that he shot a man in the leg on 17 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">He says he had nothing to do with that alleged offence and has no knowledge of its circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">He has pleaded not guilty to the charge and when the charges eventually come to trial, (if they do) he says he fully expects to be completely cleared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">In relation to the unlawful wounding charge, he had been remanded in custody but was eventually granted bail in December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">As a condition of the bail, he was required to attend at the Midland Police Station at specified times with which he fully complied (Midland is a suburb of the Perth metropolitan area).</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">He says he regularly attended the Midland Police Station without any incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">The requirement to so attend as a condition of the bail was removed, he says, from early to mid-2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">His fianc&eacute;e, Ms Roberts, was surety for his compliance with the bail conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">He says that he was aware that any breach of his bail could put her house at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">114 In addition, he has attended a number of preliminary hearings at the District Court in Perth, Western Australia 'without fail and again without incident'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">The trial was due to commence in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">It did not proceed on that date and he next attended the District Court on 27 February 2007 when the matter was re-listed in order to proceed in August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">He contends that the charges were brought 'because of the attitude and prejudices of the Western Australian police against me'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">He said it was very important to him that he had the opportunity to face the charges and to clear his name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">115 It is said that it was not only in the interests of Mr Morrison but also in the interests of the Australian community and of justice generally that those criminal proceedings be resolved and Mr Morrison be given the opportunity to clear his name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">It was also pointed out that following the removal of Mr Morrison from Australia the criminal proceedings have been discontinued, albeit that Mr Morrison could be charged once again should he be returned to Australia as a result of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">116 The argument for Mr Morrison attempts to rely on the decision of Lu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 340 ; (2004) 141 FCR 346 per Black CJ at [7] and [8] and Sackville J at [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">In that case their Honours accepted that the failure to accurately consider Mr Lu's criminal record amounted to jurisdictional error even though the offences which were misstated in the report to the Minister were in the submission for Mr Morrison, relatively minor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">The argument for Mr Morrison acknowledges the distinction between misstating a criminal record and failing to include while referring to it, the fact that the record holder is currently facing additional serious charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">But it is submitted for Mr Morrison that it is equally relevant for the decision-maker to be aware of that fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">117 In my view the two factual scenarios are quite distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">An erroneous statement about the appellant's criminal record in Lu [2004] FCAFC 340 ; 141 FCR 346 meant that the information before the Minister and provided to him for the purpose of exercising his discretion was wrong in a material respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">It followed that there was jurisdictional error by the Minister in failing to take into account (as the Minister was unable to do so) an accurate statement of the person's criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">As the Chief Justice said at [8]:
 
 I would add that the conclusion that there may be jurisdictional error if the Minister fails to take into account an accurate statement of a person's criminal record is perhaps reinforced by the circumstance that for the purposes of the character test defined in s 501(6) and (7) of the Act, and applicable to s 501A, the concept of "substantial criminal record" is defined, primarily, by reference to the sentence or sentences imposed upon a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">

118 His Honour went on to say that the nature of the sentence was at the heart of the definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">119 The fact that Mr Morrison was facing further charges on a serious offence, did not pertain to established sentences for conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">Indeed, given the presumption of innocence, there might have been complaints if the existence of the charges on the serious offence had been put before the Minister for him to take into account in the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Further, although Mr Morrison contends that in Lu [2004] FCAFC 340 ; 141 FCR 346 the misstatements about the criminal record were relatively minor, that was not the view of Sackville J who said at [58] 'The information in the Issues Paper concerning the appellant's 1993 and 1997 convictions was inaccurate in two major respects' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Indeed, his Honour earlier observed at [56] that it may be that a minor error relating to convictions or sentences imposed on a visa holder would not in substance result in the Minister failing in a relevant sense to take account of a person's criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">120 I turn then to ground 2 which does not relate to the decision itself but to the conduct involved in detaining and removing Mr Morrison from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Clearly most of the evidence which I have canvassed above and which was adduced at the hearing related to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Mr Morrison pressed the serious submission that he was deliberately deprived of information as to DIAC's intentions to immediately deport him and that he was refused use of a telephone by which he might challenge that action through the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">It was suggested that the express purpose of so depriving Mr Morrison was to preclude his opportunity to seek meaningful legal advice or representation to restrain his deportation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">121 Counsel for Mr Morrison submitted that the act of detention which was carried out by WAPOL (at the request and knowledge of DIAC and the Minister) was violent and unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Mr Morrison had committed no offences immediately prior to his detention, he was not avoiding being detained and had not even been informed that a decision had been made to cancel his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">It is contended that in those circumstances there was no basis at law for undertaking a violent arrest without warning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">It was submitted that unlawful arrest and consequent false imprisonment was a very serious matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">I accept this is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">Indeed the seriousness of this allegation is to be borne in mind when considering whether the onus of establishing it has been discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">The seriousness pertains not only to the false imprisonment allegation but also to the alleged intention to preclude the effective possibility of any intervention by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">122 The Minister accepted that the nature of the detention was violent but stressed that there was so much information made available to DIAC to stress the high risk involved in detaining Mr Morrison due to his violent criminal record and propensities that the measures taken in the circumstances and which accord with standard procedure for WAPOL and the TRG, were justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">123 It is not surprising that Mr Morrison and his family were shocked and astounded by the events which occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Mr Morrison and his family strongly dispute much of the factual basis upon which the Minister and DIAC relied as to Mr Morrison's tendencies and propensities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">Further, the considerable violence of the initial detention coupled with the fact that Mr Morrison was effectively removed from the country before there was any real opportunity for that removal to be meaningfully challenged in Court, would quite reasonably lead Mr Morrison and his family to suspicion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">The concern is whether the way in which he, in particular, was dealt with (in departure from the usual practice of permitting a 48 hour opportunity for challenge) was deliberately intended to deprive him of the opportunity for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">124 As against that it has now become known that there was a very substantial amount of official material in the hands of DIAC which rated Mr Morrison as a very high security risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">The Minister and DIAC make it clear that it was because of that information and the source from which it came that Mr Morrison was treated as being very dangerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">125 Where there is a sharp disparity between the evidence Mr Morrison and the evidence of the various officers called for the Minister and DIAC is in relation to whether or not Mr Morrison was permitted the opportunity to make phone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">126 On that topic, I prefer the evidence of the officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">When Mr Morrison was cross-examined by telephone in the United Kingdom he stressed that after having been shot with the taser he remained 'stunned for most of the day, confused, dazed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">I also take into account the fact that it was very early in the morning in the United Kingdom when he gave his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Nevertheless and perhaps understandably given the totality of the circumstances, his responses were at times somewhat aggressive and belligerent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">However, one thing he was candid about, in particular, was that he could not recall everything that occurred in the early part of the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">He attributed this to being dazed and stunned and the fall to the road and the cut to the head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">The cumulative effect of these events could most certainly cause the physical and mental reaction which Mr Morrison describes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Mr Morrison also points to the fact that there was no need, as he understood it, to use a telephone earlier in the day as he anticipated that he would be remaining in detention in Perth for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">In either event, it appears to me that little turns on the point because by 1.08 pm the intentions of DIAC and the Minister had certainly been made clear to Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">The officers were cross-examined strenuously on the topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">None of them was present in Court while others gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Counsel for Mr Morrison effectively put to them quite appropriately differences between their respective statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">While there were reasonably minor differences in the statements, the differences, in my view, were more consistent with the statements having been independently and individually prepared rather than in some collaborative or collusive effort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">127 There are two other factors which lead me to conclude that deliberately or otherwise depriving Mr Morrison of telephone use would have been very unlikely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">The first is that it is clear that at about 1.08 pm Mr Morrison was offered the use of a telephone and at that stage he had expressly been told that he was to board the plane later that day headed for the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">It is not unknown for injunctions to be sought when a person in Mr Morrison's position is actually already at the airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">In either case, the Minister and DIAC were well aware that the Court remains available (by telephone call) to urgently hear an application for an interim injunction in such circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Indeed, that is what occurred in this case albeit it is said that this was due to a delay in the departure of the aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Moreover, DIAC and the Minister had already prepared the day before an affidavit which explained the circumstances giving rise to the actions taken by the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">This clearly was in anticipation that there would be an application for injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The preparation of such an affidavit would be redundant if Mr Morrison was to be dealt with in such a way that it would be impossible for him to contact a legal advisor to pursue an application for injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">128 It remains necessary to examine whether those facts give rise to any contravention or departure from requirements under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">There appears to be no requirement under the Act that the person whose visa has been cancelled be given notice of that cancellation prior to the person being taken into immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">In the circumstances of this case on the basis of information received from WAPOL and others, the strategic view was taken that Mr Morrison should not be so informed until he was securely in custody because of the high risk that he was believed to pose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">129 Once it was clear that Mr Morrison's visa had been cancelled, the officers involved having reasonable grounds to suspect that he was an unlawful non-citizen were actually required in any event to detain Mr Morrison pursuant to s 189 of the Act ( Ruddock v Taylor (2005) 222 CLR 612 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [31]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">130 There is in my view a distinction between the detention of Mr Morrison and arrest in the circumstances of the cases relied upon by Mr Morrison ( R v Ul-Haque (2007) NSWSC 1251 and State of New South Wales v Riley [2003] NSWCA 208 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 496).</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Those cases concerned the absence of arrest warrants before the arrests were effected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">In the current situation, which is actually a detention rather than an arrest, there was a statutory obligation for officers to pursue the detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">Mr Morrison's detention was lawful and did not lead to false imprisonment: Ruddock (2005) 222 CLR at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">I do not accept that Mr Morrison was denied his rights under s 256 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">131 The application will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty one (131) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice McKerracher.</sentence>
