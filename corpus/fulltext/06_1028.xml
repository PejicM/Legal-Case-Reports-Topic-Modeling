1 The applicant is a British National (Overseas) who was born in Hong Kong on 11 August 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In 2003 the applicant enrolled in a Bachelor of Business degree at Edith Cowen University ('ECU').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 19 March 2003 the applicant was granted a student visa ('visa') which was due to expire on 15 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The applicant's visa was subject to Condition 8202 which in substance required the applicant to achieve an 'academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory' in respect of each semester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In the first semester, the applicant passed one subject, failed one subject and withdrew from another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Late in the first semester, the applicant discovered that she was pregnant, and in August 2003, early in the second semester, the pregnancy was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In that semester, the applicant passed one subject, failed one subject and did not complete another subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 On 31 May 2004, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the delegate') cancelled the applicant's visa under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') on the grounds that the applicant had breached Condition 8202 of her visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') upheld the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant now seeks judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 I join the Tribunal as the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 For the reasons which follow, the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Statutory background 
 
6 Section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) ('the ESOS Act') provides:
 
 'Sending students notice of visa breaches 
 
 
 (1) A registered provider must send an accepted student of the provider a written notice if the student has breached a student visa condition relating to attendance or satisfactory academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 (2) The registered provider must send the notice as soon as practicable after the breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 (3) The notice must be in a form approved by the Secretary of the Immigration Minister's Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 
 (4) The notice must: 
 
 
 
 a. contain particulars of the breach; and 
 
 b. state that the student is required to attend in person before an officer (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ) at a specified place within 28 days after the day specified in the notice as the date of the notice, for the purpose of explaining the breach; and 
 
 c. state that the student must present photographic identification when so attending; and 
 
 d. set out the effect of sections 137J and 137K of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">


 Unincorporated registered providers 
 
 
 (5) If the registered provider is an unincorporated body, then it is instead the principal executive officer of the provider who must send the notice as required under this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">' 
 
 

7 Section 137J of the Act provides:
 
 ' Non-complying students may have their visas automatically cancelled 
 
 
 (1) This section applies if a notice is sent to a non-citizen under section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 in relation to a visa held by the non-citizen (even if the non-citizen never receives the notice).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 
 
 (2) The non-citizen's visa is cancelled by force of this section at the end of the 28 th day after the day that the notice specifies as the date of the notice unless, before the end of that 28 th day: 
 
 
 
 (a) the non-citizen complies with the notice; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the non-citizen, while attending in person at an office of Immigration (within the meaning of the regulations) that is either: 
 
 (i) in Australia; or 
 
 (ii) approved for the purposes of this paragraph by the Minister by notice in the Gazette ; 
 
 makes himself or herself available to an officer for the stated purpose of explaining the breach alleged in the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 

8 The general power to cancel visas is provided for in s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Of particular relevance is s 116(3) which states:
 
 'If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">' 
 

9 Regulation 2.43(2) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulatons') prescribes the following circumstances in which the Minister must cancel a visa:
 
 'For subsection 116(3) of the Act, the circumstances in which the Minister must cancel a visa are: 
 
 
 (a) each of the circumstances comprising the grounds set out in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b); and 
 
 (b) in the case of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, that the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with: 
 
 (i) condition 8104 or 8105 (if the condition applies to the visa); or 
 
 (ii) condition 8202'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 

10 Condition 8202 of Sch 8 of the Regulations relevantly provides:
 
 '(1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course; or 
 
 
 (b) in the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 or 571 (Schools Sector) visa who is a secondary exchange student -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 (3) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 
 (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records -- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term and semester of the course; and 
 
 (b) in any case -- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term or semester (which ever is shorter) of the course.</sentence>

 Factual background 
 
11 On 16 December 2003, ECU issued a statement of academic record of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">ECU supplied a copy of this transcript to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the department').</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It read:

 SEMESTER AVERAGE = 40.33 COURSE AVERAGE 42.80' 

 
12 The applicant's course status was reviewed at the request of the applicant, by an independent review officer at ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The independent review officer determined that there should be no variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The applicant then appealed to the Committee of Review at ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">13 By an internal memorandum dated 16 February 2004, an international student adviser at ECU, Mr Mitchell, wrote to the Assessment Support department at ECU in support of the applicant's appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Mitchell said that the independent reviewer had failed to focus on the main issue which was the validity of the applicant's contention that the termination of her unplanned pregnancy had adversely affected her academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He went on to say:
 
 'It is accepted that the student has not performed well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The issue is whether that poor performance can be explained by the medical/personal issue that she faced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">' 
 

14 On 19 February 2004, the Committee of Review of ECU rejected the applicant's appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Committee of Review stated that the applicant's grounds were invalid and resolved that her course status remained unchanged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 On 31 March 2004 ECU sent the applicant a Non-Compliance Notification (s 20 Notice) pursuant to s 20 of the ESOS Act advising the applicant that she had breached a condition of her student visa in relation to satisfactory academic performance in the course in which she was enrolled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The particulars of the breach were stated as follows:
 
 ' Excluded 6 months 
 Pursuant to section 137J of the Migration Act 1958 , your student visa will cease on the 28 th day after the date of this notice, unless you report to DIMIA by that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The day count begins on the first day after the date of this notice and ends on the 28 th day thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">' 
 

16 The s 20 Notice also stated:
 
 'You must report personally to a compliance officer at the following Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) office: 
 
 [Perth address] with photographic identification of yourself (preferably your current passport), and a copy of this Notice to explain the breach of your student visa condition as specified above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">If you fail to bring satisfactory identification to DIMIA the automatic visa cancellation process will continue and your student visa will be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 If you report to DIMIA as required under this Notice, the automatic cancellation of your student visa will not proceed, but a decision will then be made whether or not to cancel your visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Your student visa will not be cancelled if you can show that no breach occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">' 
 

17 On 27 April 2004 the applicant attended before an officer of the department in response to the s 20 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">At the end of the meeting the departmental officer issued the applicant with a notice of intention to consider cancellation (' s 119 Notice') of the student visa under s 119 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Under the heading 'Possible grounds of cancellation' the notice stated:
 
 'On 31.3.2004 Edith Cowan University (ECU) reported to [the department] that you failed to meet academic requirements in semester 1 and 2 of 2003 (attached academic statement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 Evidence shows that you breached Condition 8202 --- academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">' 
 

18 The notice went on to invite the applicant to attend an interview at the department on 18 May 2004 to provide comments as to why her visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">19 By letter dated 27 April 2004, Mr Mitchell, the international student adviser from ECU assisting the applicant, advised the department that the applicant would be appealing to the Academic Appeal Committee within ECU against her six month exclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The letter stated:
 
 '...By appealing she is seeking a ruling that the university has considered the personal issues faced and has deemed her performance, in all the circumstances, to be satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 This is the final stage of academic appeal at the university.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I anticipate that the appeal could be prepared and lodged within the next few days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I anticipate that the matter will be heard within the next 2 to 3 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 Would you kindly consider deferring a decision on this student's visa until this process has been completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">' 
 

20 On 13 May 2004, Mr Mitchell sent a further letter to the department advising that the applicant had appealed to the Academic Appeal Committee and asked that the department defer making a decision on the applicant's visa until the outcome of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The letter also stated that the pending appeal was the final stage of the appeal process at ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The interview was rescheduled to 31 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">21 On 31 May 2004 the applicant attended an interview at the department with the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">By that date the department had been advised that the applicant's ECU appeal had not been allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The delegate cancelled the applicant's visa the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The delegate's record of decision records the applicant as having advanced the following reasons why the applicant considered the ground for cancellation did not exist:
 
 'I had significant medical and personal problems which affected my studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I attempted to get a partial withdrawal or deferral from ECU but was denied this, so I had no choice but to continue studying when I was not well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 

22 In the record of decision to cancel the visa, the delegate provided the following summary of the reasons given by the applicant as to why her visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 'Student had medical and personal issues which made study difficult in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">She sought solutions with ECU unsuccessfully and feels her study results were adversely affected by the situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">' 
 

23 The delegate's reasons for the decision to cancel the visa were:
 
 'Breach of visa condition 8202 --- failure to meet course requirement --- poor academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 

 Proceedings before the Tribunal 
 
24 On 4 June 2004 the applicant lodged an application at the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision to cancel her visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">25 In August 2004 the applicant's agent forwarded to the Tribunal a letter in support of the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It included a document entitled 'Agent's Overview' which contained two attachments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">One attachment was the internal memorandum from Mr Mitchell to the Assessment Support department referred to in [13] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">26 Another attachment was a memorandum dated 2 March 2004 from a student counsellor, Ms Fiona Bartlett, to an officer in the Assessment Support department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In this internal memorandum Ms Bartlett stated that she had seen the applicant and the applicant had presented with significant personal and medical issues that had affected her studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Ms Bartlett went on to say:
 
 'In my opinion her issues have significantly affected her ability to concentrate and focus on her studies throughout last semester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">I therefore believe she has valid grounds for a late withdrawal without academic penalty from the unit ACC2360 in light of these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

27 Further the applicant's agent contended in his 'Agent's Overview' that the decision-maker had erred because she should have sought more information from ECU about the applicant's medical and personal circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">28 In a letter dated 15 October 2004 pursuant to s 359A of the Act, the Tribunal invited the applicant to comment on the following information:
 
 
 &#8226; 'Section 20 notice...dated 31 March 2004... 
 
 
 
 &#8226; Academic transcript from ECU dated 16 December 2003... 
 
 &#8226; ECU letter of 13 May 2004 and delegate's notation that appeal to ECU was not successful...' 
 
 

29 In response to the invitation the applicant's agent sent a letter dated 29 November 2004, enclosing a number of documents which included:
 
 &#8226; A letter dated 8 August 2003 from a representative of the organisation, Marie Stopes International, which advised that following a counselling session and medical examination, the applicant had a medical procedure terminating her pregnancy on 8 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The pregnancy had been unplanned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">


 
 &#8226; A letter dated 23 November 2004 from Ms Jennie Connolly, a clinical psychologist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The letter referred to a psychological assessment of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">

30 The psychologist concluded as follows:
 
 'It is my professional opinion that [the applicant] was suffering symptoms consistent with a clinically significant psychological disorder (Adjustment Disorder with mixed Anxiety and Depression) during the end of Semester I and all of Semester II 2003, and that this was highly likely to have had a significant impact on her academic performance over that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I would consider this situation as "exceptional circumstances beyond her control" which would have contributed significantly to her unsatisfactory results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">' 
 

31 In the letter the applicant's agent also said that there had been a further appeal that the applicant could have been made within 10 days of the Committee of Review's decision, but the applicant had never been advised of this option until well after the expiry of such an appeal period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It was also said that the applicant was not informed of her appeal rights by ECU in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">32 The agent's letter also stated that it was 'lamentable that the committee of review appears to have made its decision based on a statistical analysis of her academic progress without taking into consideration the extenuating circumstances...' The letter went on to say that the 'Presiding Member' might decide that the first respondent should not cancel the applicant's visa because he or she is not fully satisfied that the applicant breached Condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">33 On 1 March 2005 the applicant attended a hearing of the Tribunal and gave evidence by video link.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">At the hearing the applicant explained that her studies had suffered as a result of her personal crisis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicant was represented at this hearing by an agent, who made submissions to the Tribunal to the effect that the decision-makers at ECU had not taken the applicant's personal circumstances into account in rejecting her appeals and may have breached ECU's internal equity and disability policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In its decision dated 9 March 2005 the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision to cancel the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Tribunal's Decision 
 
34 In its reasons for decision the Tribunal stated:
 
 'With leave, the review applicant's agent said that the appeal did not conform with the rules and policy of ECU, and that the official hearing the appeal was dismissive of the psychologist's evidence and the comments of Faculty staff in relation to the gravity of the crisis faced by the review applicant in 2003, and may have breached the University's equity and disability policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">' 
 

35 The Tribunal said that ECU has certified in the s 20 Notice that the applicant has been excluded for a period of six months due to her unsatisfactory academic results in semesters 1 and 2 of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Tribunal went on to say that:
 
 'The Tribunal notes the express wording of Condition 8202(3)(b) vests discretion to determine the satisfactoriness or otherwise of the review applicant's academic results exclusively in the provider, and the Tribunal acknowledges strong judicial authority for the proposition that it confers no discretion upon immigration decision makers to go behind the education provider's certification, or substitute their own assessment of the applicant's academic performance for that of the provider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">' 
 

36 The Tribunal stated further:
 
 '...the Tribunal finds that the review applicant breached condition 8202(3)(b), a condition attached to her subclass 573 visa, in semesters 1 and 2 of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that grounds for cancellation of the review applicant's visa exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In light of this finding, subsection 116(3) of the Act and paragraph 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations require that the review applicant's visa must be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">On the basis of the reasoning in Nguyen and Hou , the Tribunal does not have any discretion in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">' 
 

 The application before the Court 
 
37 At the commencement of the hearing the applicant moved to amend the grounds of review in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Subject to the question of any costs thrown away, the first respondent did not oppose the amendment application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Accordingly, subject to the applicant paying any of the first respondent's costs thrown away by the amendment, I allowed the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">38 The applicant also sought to tender evidence contained in three affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">These affidavits were an affidavit of Mr Christopher Gerald Narayanan dated 27 July 2005 and two affidavits of the applicant dated 27 July 2005 and 11 November 2005 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">39 At the hearing I stated that I would provisionally admit the affidavits into evidence but would rule on their admissibility in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">40 In his affidavit, Mr Narayanan deposes that he obtained documents from the Tribunal and ECU, and an audio tape recording of the Committee of Review hearing at ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The documentation obtained from the Tribunal is annexed to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It comprises the materials which are contained in the Court Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">There is also annexed to the affidavit transcript of the audio tape of the ECU Committee of Review hearing which Mr Narayanan caused to be made, a copy of ECU's (Admission Enrolment and Academic Progress) Rules contained in ECU's 2003 Handbook, a facsimile transmission dated 7 July 2005 to ECU requesting that ECU grant an extension of time within which to appeal against the Committee of Review's decision, and a response from ECU agreeing to extend time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">41 The applicant's affidavit of 27 July 2005 comprises eight paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Paragraph 2 of the applicant's affidavit of 27 July 2005 annexes the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Paragraph 3 records part of the reasons of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">42 In para 4 of that affidavit the applicant deposes to, and annexes documentation relating to, the circumstance of the termination of her pregnancy, her dealings with university officers at ECU, her appeals at ECU and the lodgment of her application with the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The affidavit also deposes to the different view taken by Ms Bartlett and Mr Mitchell as to her circumstances to that taken by the internal reviewer and the Committee of Review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The affidavit annexes additional documentation, which was not before the Tribunal, showing dealings between Ms Bartlett and Mr Mitchell on the one hand, and the university officers engaged in the appeal process, on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">43 At subparas 4.27-4.32 the applicant deposes specifically as to her dealings with the department following the receipt of the s 20 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">44 In para 5 the applicant says that after her six month exclusion she has continued studies at ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In para 6 the applicant explains that her six month exclusion did not mean that she was forbidden thereafter from enrolling in any unit that she had previously failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In para 7 the applicant states that she did not believe that ECU observed proper procedures or took into account relevant considerations when the ECU determined to exclude her from the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Paragraph 8 records submissions made by the applicant's agent before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">45 The applicant's supplementary affidavit of 11 November 2005, deposes that, on 25 July 2005, some time after the Tribunal decision, ECU extended the time for the applicant to appeal from the Committee of Review, and that on 10 November 2005, ECU had allowed the applicant's appeal, and that her academic record has been changed to reflect the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">46 A change of circumstances after the Tribunal has made its decision, will not in itself constitute a ground to impugn the decision of the Tribunal, nor will it provide a basis on which the Court can require the Tribunal to reconsider its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">(See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Thiyagarajah [2000] HCA 9 ; (2000) 199 CLR 343 at 355.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">However, a court may admit evidence of the circumstances of a hearing where an allegation of breach of procedural fairness is made in relation to the conduct of that hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">47 Applying these principles, I deal firstly with the affidavit of Mr Narayanan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those paragraphs of the affidavit which annex the material obtained from the Tribunal are superfluous because that material is already before the Court in the Court Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The copy of the transcript of the hearing before the ECU Committee of Review and the copy of ECU's rules were not before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The documents and the paragraphs annexing them are inadmissible on the grounds that they are irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The correspondence with ECU regarding the extension of time within which to appeal against the decision of the Committee of Review post-date the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The documents are, therefore, irrelevant and inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Accordingly, I do not admit the affidavit of Mr Narayanan into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">48 I deal with the applicant's affidavit of 27 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Paragraph 2 and para 3 are admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">49 As to para 4, insofar as the applicant's dealings with the department are concerned, by reason of the applicant having raised an issue relating to procedural fairness in her dealings with the departmental officer, the evidence is, in my view, admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I would, accordingly, admit the evidence at paras 4.27-4.32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The rest of para 4 comprises evidence which was not before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">I would, accordingly, therefore, not admit the contents of paras 4.1-4.26 and the documents referred to therein, into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Insofar as those paragraphs annex documents already in the Court Book, the additional documents are superfluous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">50 Paragraph 5 is irrelevant because it deals with what has happened since the expiry of the applicant's exclusion from ECU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Paragraph 6 and para 7 are inadmissible on the grounds that they comprise argument and submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Paragraph 8 is admissible on the basis that it deposes to proceedings before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">51 As to the applicant's affidavit of 11 November 2005, the evidence that ECU has subsequently changed its mind and allowed the appeal is irrelevant to the question of whether, on the material which was before the Tribunal, at the time that it made its decision, the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Accordingly, in my view, the whole of the affidavit of the applicant of 11 November 2005 is inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">52 In her amended application, the applicant relied upon four grounds of review as giving rise to jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">They can be summarised as follows:
 
 1 The Tribunal erred in law because in the absence of a positive or negative certification by ECU as to the applicant's academic result, the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the applicant had breached Condition 8202(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This was because the s 20 Notice issued by ECU did not allege 'unsatisfactory academic results in semesters 1 and 2 of 2003', rather, it only alleged that the applicant had been 'excluded for 6 months'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Tribunal could not be satisfied that the proper inference to be drawn from the exclusion by ECU of the applicant for six months was that the applicant had not complied with Condition 8202(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">


 
 2 The Tribunal erred in failing to examine the applicant's claim that ECU did not correctly apply its own rules governing internal appeals and whether, in fact, the applicant had exhausted all avenues of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Tribunal also erred in failing to inquire whether ECU's determination to exclude the applicant for six months amounted to ECU certifying that the applicant's academic result was 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">


 
 3 The Tribunal erred in failing to address the question of whether, when the applicant had attended the office of the department in response to the s 20 Notice, the delegate had denied the applicant procedural fairness in failing to provide her with an opportunity to give evidence as to her medical and psychological condition for the purpose of 'explaining the breach' before the delegate issued the s 119 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">


 
 4 The Tribunal erred in failing to find that the applicant was denied procedural fairness by reason of having been issued with a s 20 Notice which was misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The s 20 Notice created the impression that, the 'breach' could be explained, inferring that there was a discretion to take into account personal circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The s 20 Notice failed to inform the applicant that s 116 of the Act requires the Minister to cancel a visa for breach of Condition 8202 irrespective of any exceptional circumstances which may exist, whereas on the automatic cancellation of the visa under s 137J of the Act, it was open to the applicant to rely upon exceptional circumstances to revoke the automatic cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It also said that the s 20 Notice was defective because it failed to inform the applicant that she could report to an officer at a departmental office, instead the s 20 Notice required that the applicant report to a compliance officer at a particular departmental office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">

53 I will deal with each of the grounds of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Ground 1 - No basis upon which Tribunal could be satisfied of breach of Condition 8202(3)(b) 

 
54 The applicant submitted that the breach of Condition 8202(3)(b) needed to be identified in the s 20 Notice, before the Tribunal could be satisfied that the condition has not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicant submitted that all that the s 20 Notice did was to state that there had been a breach of a condition relating to satisfactory academic performance and give particulars as 'excluded 6 months'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The s 20 Notice did not refer to Condition 8202 or its wording, nor did it refer to the relevant semester period in which it is alleged that there was no satisfactory academic performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">55 The submissions of the applicant cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The submissions misapprehend the function of a s 20 Notice in relation to the process whereby the first respondent cancels a visa under s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Section 137J of the Act, refers to the function of a s 20 Notice in the context of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">In Zhou v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1078 ; (2004) 139 FCR 60 at 68-69 ('Zhou 2004') , Cooper J observed:
 
 'Section 137J of the Act is part of Subdiv GB of Div 3 of Pt 2, which is concerned with the automatic cancellation of student visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The subdivision is completely self-contained and includes ss 137J-137N inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The subdivision has no relevant operation in respect of Subdiv D of Div 3, which contains s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Subdivision D is concerned with the cancellation of visas on the grounds specified in s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Subdivision D has no relevant operation in respect of any of the matters provided for in Subdivision GB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">
 
 The process for automatic cancellation of a student visa is initiated by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 20 of the ESOS Act; s 137J(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Subdivision GB cannot operate in the absence of the giving of a notice under s 20 of the ESOS Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">' 
 

56 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ('Zhou 2006') , the Full Court confirmed that there was no legal inter-relationship between s 20 of the ESOS Act and s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That was so even in the case where, as in this case, the giving of a s 20 Notice gives rise to the delivery of a s 119 Notice ( Zhou 2006 at [41]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">In this case, the applicant's visa was cancelled under s 116 of the Act on the grounds that the applicant had breached Condition 8202 of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Section 116 of the Act gives the first respondent power to cancel the visa if he or she is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with a condition of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Section 116(3) read with reg 2.43(2) states that the first respondent has no discretion and must cancel the visa where there is a breach of a Condition 8202 of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">57 Condition 8202(3)(b) prescribes that there is compliance with Condition 8202 of the visa in relation to academic performance if the holder achieves an academic result for the semester in question which is certified by the education provider to be 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The Regulations contemplate an act by the education provider to positively certify that the result is satisfactory: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448 at 456 per Allsop J ('Yu') .</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">58 In Zhou 2004 at 71 Cooper J, referring to the making of a decision to cancel a visa under s 116 of the Act, observed:
 
 '...the time for the decision-maker to make a decision does not arise until the procedures in subdivision E of Div 3 have been complied with and at that time the decision is made on the whole of the materials then available to the decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">' 
 

59 In this case by the time that matter came before the Tribunal the procedures in subdiv E of div 3 of the Act had been complied with in that a s 119 Notice had been issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Before the Tribunal was evidence of the applicant's academic transcript for semesters 1 and 2 of the 2003 academic year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">There was also evidence of the applicant's failed efforts to review her six month exclusion by ECU because of her academic results, and of ECU's determination not to alter the academic transcript on the grounds of the applicant's medical and personal circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The applicant did not produce to the Tribunal a certificate from ECU certifying that the applicant's academic result for either the first or second semesters of 2003 was 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The Tribunal did not, in those circumstances, fall into jurisdictional error in upholding the delegate's decision to cancel the applicant's visa on the grounds of breach of Condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Ground 2 - Failure to inquire into ECU's internal appeal process 
 
60 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to inquire as to whether ECU's appeal process had been lawfully carried out and whether the applicant had exhausted all avenues of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">61 Before the Tribunal, the applicant complained about ECU's appeal process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">These complaints were made in her agent's letters to the Tribunal and also, by the applicant's agent at the hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">However, neither the applicant nor the applicant's agents advised the Tribunal that the applicant intended to take any further steps directed towards having ECU reconsider its position as expressed by the Committee of Review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In other words, the applicant did not suggest to the Tribunal that the appeal process within ECU had not been exhausted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Nor did the applicant submit that the Tribunal should adjourn the hearing of the review application until such time as an application to ECU was made to extend the time for the applicant to appeal against the decision of the Committee of Review or until the applicant had taken other steps within the decision-making hierarchy at ECU to remedy the defects of which the applicant complained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Rather, the applicant's submissions were to the effect that the Tribunal should go behind the ECU appeal decisions and come to its own view that the medical and psychological issues which had confronted the applicant during the second semester meant that the academic performance of the applicant was 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">62 These submissions misapprehended the function of the Tribunal and also the basis upon which compliance with Condition 8202 was to be achieved, namely, by obtaining a certificate from ECU that the applicant's academic result was 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">For these reasons, the Tribunal was correct in not going behind the ECU's decisions ( Tian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 238 at [55] - [56] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">63 Further, whilst it is accepted that a distinction may be made between a student's academic result and his or her academic status, there was nothing in the facts before the Tribunal to cause it to doubt that the applicant was accorded her academic status as 'excluded for 6 months' by ECU as a result of her poor academic results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">This was the obvious inference from the terms of the academic transcript, the correspondence between Mr Mitchell and Ms Bartlett and the Assessment Support department, the submissions made in the applicants' agent's letter to the Tribunal of 29 November 2004 and the s 20 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">There was, therefore, no ambiguity on the issue, and, therefore, no reason for the Tribunal to make any inquiries of ECU as to whether the documentation could be construed as certifying that the applicant had achieved an academic result which was 'at least satisfactory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Ground 3 - Failure to address procedural defects in the lead up to the cancellation of the visa 

 
64 The applicant said that the s 20 Notice referred to the applicant having an opportunity to 'explain the breach' when she attended the departmental office on 27 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The applicant submitted on attending the departmental office, the officer had issued the s 119 Notice without receiving evidence as to the applicant's medical and psychological condition during the second semester; and, in so doing, had failed to accord the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The Tribunal, it was submitted, fell into jurisdictional error by not addressing this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">65 The applicant's submissions are not accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">As already mentioned in [56] above, the Full Court in Zhou 2006 has confirmed that there is no legal interaction between the giving of a s 20 Notice and the cancellation of a visa under s 116 of the Act, even where the issue of a s 20 Notice gives rise to the issue of a s 119 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">It does not avail the applicant to impugn the procedural fairness of a process which is legally unrelated to the process which led to the impugned decision, namely, the cancellation of the visa under s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">66 The applicant's visa was cancelled pursuant to s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In determining to proceed under s 116 of the Act the first respondent came under an obligation to accord the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The purpose of the issue of the s 119 Notice to the applicant was to warn the applicant of the intention to cancel the visa and provide the applicant with the opportunity to make submissions in relation thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The first respondent accorded the applicant procedural fairness by issuing the s 119 Notice and considering the applicant's submissions on 31 May 2004 before cancelling the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">67 In any event, it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the question of whether the applicant had been accorded procedural fairness because the hearing before the Tribunal was itself a merits review and any defects leading to the decision of the delegate were cured by the review undertaken by the Tribunal ( Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344; Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; 149 FCR 558 ('Humayun ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Ground 4 --- Breach of procedural fairness because the s 20 Notice was misleading 
 
68 The applicant submitted that she had been denied procedural fairness because of the misleading nature of the s 20 Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">69 It was submitted that the first respondent required education providers to issue notices under s 20 of the ESOS Act in a prescribed form, which used language which was misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The wording in the s 20 Notice induced the applicant to report to the departmental office within 28 days in the expectation that the department would exercise a discretion whether or not to proceed to the cancellation of her visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">It was further submitted that if the first respondent had not impliedly misrepresented to the applicant that the department had a discretion the 'applicant would have had every reason to decline to attend the departmental office', allow for a cancellation and then apply for revocation of the cancellation, being able to invoke the exceptional circumstances beyond her control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The procedural unfairness relied upon is the failure of the applicant's expectation of being able to raise matters relating to her medical and personal circumstances as a means of preventing the cancellation of her visa when there was an alternative course available to the applicant which would have permitted her to raise her medical and personal circumstances as a means of reinstating her visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">70 Although not pleaded as a ground of review, the applicant also submitted that the first respondent was estopped from cancelling the applicant's visa by reason of the representation in the s 20 Notice that the applicant's personal circumstances would be considered before the cancellation of the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">71 In my view, the applicant's contentions cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Firstly, there was no evidence before the Tribunal, nor before this Court, that the applicant was actually misled by the s 20 Notice nor that she would have been content to let her visa be cancelled by not responding to the s 20 Notice with the intention of bringing an application for the revocation of the cancellation on the grounds of the exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">In the absence of any such evidence there was no basis upon which a plea of estoppel could be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Even if such evidence had been forthcoming, several issues would have arisen, including whether the s 20 Notice which was issued by ECU (albeit in a prescribed form), and not the first respondent, could be said to be a representation binding on the first respondent, whether the s 20 Notice was in fact misleading as alleged, and the effect of the principle in Formosa v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1993) 46 FCR 117.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">72 Secondly, the submission of the applicant misapprehends the relevance and function of a s 20 Notice to a cancellation decision made under s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">As previously mentioned, the Full Court in Zhou 2006 held that there is no legal interaction or relationship between the process invoked by a s 20 Notice and the cancellation process under s 116 of the Act, even if the attendance by the visa holder at the departmental office in response to a s 20 Notice led to the issue of a s 119 Notice under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">As the impugned decision was made under s 116 of the Act, it does not, therefore, avail the applicant to complain of procedural unfairness in relation to a process which is unrelated to the legally separate process that led to the making of the impugned decision by the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">73 In the absence of the applicant having advanced an estoppel case based on evidence of the applicant's reliance and detriment, the applicant's arguments based on the misleading nature of the s 20 Notice are, on proper analysis, similar in effect, to the contentions of the applicant before the Full Court in Zhou 2006 , namely, that the validity of the decision to cancel the visa under s 116 of the Act could be impugned because that process had been instituted as a consequence of the visa holder being trapped into attending the departmental office pursuant to a misleading s 20 Notice, when there was an alternative course available, which would have permitted the exceptional circumstances to be considered (see Zhou 2006 at [35]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">74 As has already mentioned, the applicant's visa was cancelled under s 116 of the Act for breach of Condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">It is by reference to a cancellation decision made under that section, that the question of whether procedural fairness was accorded to the applicant, must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The applicant was issued with a s 119 Notice and given the opportunity to make submissions to the delegate that the visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">There was no failure to accord procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Further, and in any event, as already mentioned the Tribunal afforded the applicant a merits review and, therefore, any procedural defect in the previous process was cured by the subsequent merits review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">75 The applicant also submitted that the s 20 Notice contained two other defects which were recognised in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Firstly it requires the visa holder to report to a 'compliance officer', whereas s 137J(2) of the Act only requires the visa holder to report to 'an officer'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Secondly, the notice requires the visa holder to report to a specific office, whereas s 137J(2) of the Act states that the visa holder is required to report to 'an office of immigration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">76 This contention must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">A s 20 Notice is not the instrument of cancellation and is not a pre-condition to cancellation pursuant to s 116 of the Act (Allsop J at 456 in Yu ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Any defect in a s 20 Notice does not invalidate a decision to cancel a visa under s 116 of the Act ( Humayun at 567).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">77 The application is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I certify that the preceding seventy-seven (77) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis.</sentence>
