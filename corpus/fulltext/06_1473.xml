1 This appeal is from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Raphael of 8 March 2005 making a sequestration order against the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">There are four issues outlined in the Amended Notice of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The first two concern the construction and effect of an undertaking given by consent and an order made by his Honour on 10 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The third issue is whether his Honour erred in law in failing to dismiss the creditor's petition on the basis that there was sufficient cause for so doing under s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Fourthly, the issue is whether the bankruptcy notice is a nullity because there was reasonable doubt as to the identity of the creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">OVERVIEW 
 
2 This appeal arises in the context of a long complex history of nationwide litigation concerning recovery of solicitors' fees found to be due and owing to the respondent firm, Leonard Cohen &amp; Co, based on costs taxed in the Western Australian District Court in an amount of $7,771.55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The bankruptcy notice was issued by Leonard Cohen &amp; Co on 13 January 2005 in relation to the above judgment debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The judgment debt was based on a judgment in the District Court of Western Australia in Matter No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2520 of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 On 30 June 2005, Registrar Tesoriero dismissed the appellant's application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An application was then made to review that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 10 August 2005, Federal Magistrate Raphael made orders by consent extending time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice until three working days after the decision was made on a strike out application then pending in the District Court brought by the respondent in respect of the appellant's cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 On 24 August 2005, the District Court Registrar made orders in Matter No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">2520 of 2003, dismissing the appellant's application to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 The orders of the consent orders and undertaking given and made on 10 August 2005 were in the following terms:
 
 'Upon hearing Mr Gracie for the applicant and Mr Forbes for the respondent and upon the applicant undertaking that in the event that his joint application to the District Court of Western Australia to strike out proceedings No 2520 of 2003 is unsuccessful he will forthwith pay the amount claimed in bankruptcy Notice No 22 of 2005 and will take no further proceedings seeking to set aside the said notice and by consent: 
 
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT:
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice 22 of 2005 extended until 3 working days after the decision of the Registrar District court in the strike out application is handed down or the strike out application is otherwise dismissed whichever is the earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In the event the strike out proceedings are decided in favour of the applicant and the proceedings 2520 of 2003 are struck out with costs the bankruptcy notice is set aside upon the making of such orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Costs of these proceedings will be reserved for decision and the parties are required to file with my associate and serve submissions thereon on or before 1 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">' 
 
 
 

6 The relief sought in the proceedings before the District Court Registrar as outlined on the Chamber Summons for Summary Judgment and strike out of the respondent's Writ of Summons and Statement Of Claim dated 14 April 2005 was stated as follows:
 
 '(1) The time for bringing this application be extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 (2) Summary judgment be entered against the Plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 (3) In the alternative to 2 the Plaintiff's claim be struck out in its entirety as vexatious and/or an abuse of the process of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 (4) The Plaintiff's claim be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 (5) Alternatively this matter be stayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 (6) Such further alternative relief as the court deems fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 
 (7) [An application for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">]' 

7 The orders made on that application by the Deputy Registrar on 24 August 2005 were as follows:
 
 (1) 'Paragraph 3 of the application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 (2) The balance of the application be adjourned sine dine .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 
 
 (3) Costs be reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">' 
 
 
 

8 The respondent filed its creditor's petition dated 15 December 2005 and the Federal Magistrate made the Sequestration Order on 8 March 2006 after hearing the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">ISSUE 1 --- TIME FOR COMPLIANCE 
 
9 The appellant submits that on a proper construction of the Court Order of 24 August 2005 there was no decision on the strike out application because the expression "strike out application" was intended to refer to a decision which disposed of every prayer for relief in the summons and application to strike out heard by the District Court Deputy Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This application, it is said, sought additional orders to the strike out, including an application that there be summary judgment against Leonard Cohen &amp; Co and that the proceedings be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 Order 16 of the District Court Rules gives the power to grant summary judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The language of the Court Order is clear, and it refers specifically to the strike out application and not to the disposition of the application before the Deputy Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Separate relief was sought based on two different orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The strike out application was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The strike out application was therefore the subject of "a decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There is no reference in the Chamber Summons to the disposition of all relief sought in the summons, including summary judgment and other prayers in the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">On the contrary, the reference was, by consent, limited specifically to the application for a strike out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">One must assume that when orders of this nature are consented to, careful thought has been given to the precise wording.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Accordingly, for these reasons, the "three working days" as referred to in the Consent Orders, ran from the making of the Court Order dismissing the strike out application on 24 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The fact that there is a reference to the balance of the application being adjourned and costs reserved does not affect this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">11 Accordingly, I do not accept the appellant's submission on the first issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">ISSUE TWO --- UNDERTAKING 
 
12 The application to strike out was unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The undertaking given in terms committed the appellant to forthwith pay the amount claimed in the bankruptcy action and to take no further proceedings seeking to set aside the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">This undertaking was enlivened on and after dismissal of the strike out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">13 It must also be kept in mind that in the judgment under appeal, the learned Magistrate was construing the consent undertaking and not a statutory instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The undertaking is a consensual document and it is the common intent of the parties in giving and accepting the obligations therein, as reasonably construed in the light of the context, which determines its effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The appellant submits that the undertaking does not cover an opposition to a creditor's petition on the ground that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is said that opposition to a sequestration order under s 52 of the Act raises some different considerations to those relevant to an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice under s 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">This can be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 However, in the context of this litigation, the Consent Orders were intended to and in terms require the appellant to refrain from any further challenges to the bankruptcy notice in whatever form and at whatever stage such challenge is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The procedure to oppose the petition involves filing a Notice of Opposition and an Affidavit: see O 77 r 11 of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The purpose of the undertaking is that no steps will be taken to challenge the notice as a condition of the respondent's agreement to extend the time for compliance until a decision is made on the strike out application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">There is an inconsistency between an undertaking not to take proceedings to set aside the bankruptcy notice yet to reserve a right to achieve the same result under the discretionary power given in s 52(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The undertaking does not limit the expression 'proceedings' to one under s 40 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It commits the appellant not to take any proceedings which produce the result of effectively setting aside the notice for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I do not accept the submission of the appellant on this second issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">ISSUE 3 --- S 52 --- SUFFICIENT CAUSE 
 
15 Under s 52(2) of the Act , if the Court is not satisfied with proof of any of the matters specified in the creditor's petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not be made, the Court has a discretion to dismiss the petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">This discretionary power is broad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 The onus is on the appellant to establish "sufficient cause".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The appellant relies on outstanding costs orders against the respondent which have been made but which have not been taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The appellant relies on the evidence of a costs expert that the total amount will exceed the debt in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">17 A similar argument was not successful on the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice before Registrar Tesoriero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The respondent refers to judgments and orders for costs untaxed in other proceedings, which are said to exceed the costs referred to by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The potential claim of the appellant for costs is said to be in the order of an amount less than $20,000.00, whereas there is an outstanding judgment in favour of the respondent for $240,512.51 exclusive of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">18 Having regard to the consent undertaking, the judgments referred to in submissions, and the relative costs awards together with the outstanding judgment sum of $240,512.51, the appellant has not satisfied me that there is "other sufficient cause" which would warrant dismissal of the petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is not necessary for me to consider, as a matter of law, whether the undertaking precludes the appellant from raising this issue, but it clearly is an important matter for consideration when contemplating the exercise of the statutory discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">ISSUE 4 --- IDENTITY OF CREDITORS 
 
19 The appellant submits that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside because there is uncertainty as to the identity of the judgment creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Counsel does not submit that there is any direct evidence from the appellant that he was misled as to the creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Nor is there any suggestion that the appellant made any attempt to pay the outstanding monies as required by the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Nevertheless, it is contended by the appellant that the judgment debtor must not be left in any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the judgment creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">20 Counsel for the appellant submits that there was reasonable doubt in this case having regard to the following circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The respondent says that the agreements it sues on were on entered into on 21 September 1995 and 1 October 1995, at a time when Mr Leonard Cohen was a sole trader carrying on business under the name "Leonard Cohen &amp; Co." On 1 November 2005, Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes joined the partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">21 The evidence of Mr Georgiou in an affidavit signed on 17 May 2005 is that it was a term of the partnership agreement that the partnership assumed all rights and obligations of Mr Cohen's existing practice as from 1 November 1995, excluding debtors to whom accounts had been rendered prior to 1 November 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Georgiou notes that included in the rights and obligations were all the rights and obligations pursuant to the agreement entered into on 21 September 1995 between Leonard Cohen &amp; Co and the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He states that on 1 November 1995, the respondent further assumed all rights and obligations in relation to the written retainer agreement entered into on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">On 8 December 1995, a Statement of Change in Registered Particulars was registered reflecting the change as to owners of the business name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">22 The work which is the subject of the relevant claim was carried out by the firm from September 1995 and ceased in February 1998, when instructions were withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">When the first writ was issued on 17 March 2000, the three above named persons traded as "Leonard Cohen &amp; Co." The writ in respect of which the relevant costs order was made was issued when Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes owned the company name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">23 On 30 June 2003, Mr Cohen ceased to be a co-proprietor of the business name, but there is evidence that the partnership with Messrs Georgiou and Vertannes was continued for limited purposes, presumably in order to wind up all the affairs of the partnership, including collection of all debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">24 The appellant says that there was reasonable doubt in his mind as to the identity of the creditor, and that therefore the notice is a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would have been misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">25 It is common ground that a firm can bring bankruptcy proceedings in the firm name under s 307 of the Act , and that a change in the composition of the firm does not invalidate the bankruptcy notice: Anderson Rice v Bride (1995) 61 FCR 529 and 542.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court in Anderson Rice noted that it is the duty of the debtor to seek out and to pay the judgment creditor, if the creditor is in Australia: James v Federal Commissioner for Taxation [1955] HCA 75 ; (1955) 93 CLR 631 at 639.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">This reasoning is applicable in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">26 I am not persuaded that there was any basis on which it could be established that the appellant had any reasonable ground to doubt that those parties constituting the firm under the name Leonard Cohen &amp; Co obtained the rights to remuneration and obligations in respect of work during September 1995 through February 1998, or that they were the proprietors of the firm entitled to recover the fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">At all relevant times in this period, the partnership was constituted by Mr Cohen and as from 1 November 2005, with retrospective effect, the firm included Messrs Cohen, Georgiou and Vertannes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">27 I note that the bankruptcy notice of 13 January 2005 referred to "Leonard Cohen &amp; Co" and gave the address of that firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It also stated that payment could be made to Stewart Forbes, Barrister and Solicitor at 16 Irwin Street, Perth and the evidence indicates that no attempt was made to proffer any such payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Notice also specifies that Mr Forbes, who issued the notice, was the agent of the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">28 The evidence does not establish that the appellant was misled as to the persons to whom he should pay the debt, nor that he had any reasonable doubt as to when the work was done or that such work included work up to February 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">He could have made payment to Stewart Forbes and this would have satisfied the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Accounting between the parties as to the allocation of the payment was a matter for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">29 This case is in no way comparable the facts in McWilliam v Jackson [2000] FCA 175 ; (2000) 96 FCR 561 where the creditor was identified in the notice as "Anthony Jackson &amp; Others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">" The reference to "others" in that case was open-ended and uncertain on its face.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">30 I do not accept this final ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Furthermore, I consider that it is contrary to the undertaking given by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">31 For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Associate:
