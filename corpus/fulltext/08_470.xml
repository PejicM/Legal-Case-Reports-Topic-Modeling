1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging that the use by Darrell Lea of a shade of the colour purple in connection with its chocolate confectionery business amounted to the tort of passing off and also misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 I found in favour of Darrell Lea: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 69 IPR 23 (the earlier judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Subsequently the Full Court upheld Cadbury's appeal on the ground that I had wrongly excluded evidence sought to be adduced by Cadbury from three expert witnesses, Dr Brian Gibbs, Dr Constantino Stavros and Mr Timothy Riches (collectively, the Cadbury experts): Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 72 IPR 261 ( Full Court I ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 Cadbury sought a new trial but their Honours at [114] directed that it be remitted to me for further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Their Honours observed at [128]:
 While there may well be cogent reasons for suspecting that, even with the disputed evidence, the result would have been the same, the Full Court cannot be confident that that is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It is not possible, therefore, to conclude that there was no miscarriage of justice by reason of that error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Accordingly, the appeal should be upheld, the orders of the primary judge should be set aside and there should be an order for the proceeding to be remitted to the primary judge for further trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Cadbury brought a motion to the Full Court seeking an order that the previous order remitting the matter to the trial judge for further hearing be varied to provide that the matter be remitted to the trial judge for a new trial: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102 ( Full Court II ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In rejecting Cadbury's motion the Full Court said:
 4 We do not understand Cadbury to be suggesting that an order remitting the matter to the primary judge for a further hearing was not open to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Cadbury's motion appears to have been prompted by a directions hearing before the primary judge on 12 June 2007 during which his Honour indicated his understanding that the effect of the Full Court's order was that there would be a further hearing at which the excluded evidence would be adduced, but that that would be the extent of the further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It would seem that that was not Cadbury's understanding of the effect of the Full Court's order of 21 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 It is clear that Cadbury sought a new trial as part of the relief claimed in the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On the hearing of the appeal, one of the issues was whether, even if there had been an error on the part of the primary judge in excluding evidence there was nevertheless no miscarriage of justice and the orders made by the primary judge should therefore stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Full Court rejected that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Court concluded that it could not be said that the disputed evidence was of so little weight that it could not influence the result of a new trial, so as to produce a different result (at [111]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 However, the Court did not consider that a new trial was justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Rather, the Court was of the view that justice would be served by a further hearing before the primary judge, at which Cadbury would have another opportunity of adducing the disputed evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The proceeding was remitted on the basis that it would be before the primary judge as though the case were part heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Thus, it would be a matter for the primary judge to determine the extent to which, after entertaining all proper objections and making rulings on such objections, additional or further evidence should be admitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That would be an aspect of the management of the further hearing by the primary judge in the same way as it would have been had his Honour not rejected the disputed evidence in its entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That is to say, it would be for counsel for Darrell Lea to make such objections to the admissibility of the disputed evidence on formal grounds as they may consider appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">If, in the exercise of his discretion, the primary judge were to permit Cadbury the opportunity of adducing further evidence to overcome any objections, that would be a matter entirely for his Honour at the further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 It is conceivable that, after hearing proper objections from Darrell Lea, none of the disputed evidence will be admitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">We do not, by that comment, indicate any view about the outcome of any objections one way or the other, except to the extent that we indicated the principles to be applied in our reasons of 21 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is, of course, conceivable, and we make no comment one way or the other as to whether it is likely, that is Honour would still reject the disputed evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">That is entirely a matter for the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">10 Further, there would be no reason why the primary judge should entertain any contention that he should reverse earlier rulings made by him that were not in any way dependant upon the rejection of the disputed evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">His Honour should be in a position to conduct the further hearing as though he had admitted such of the disputed evidence as his Honour finds to be admissible after considering appropriate objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 In so far as we referred to "a further trial" (at [129]) or "the new trial judge" (at [130]) we should be understood as having referred to a further hearing by the primary judge along those lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">As we said (at [114]): 
 
 In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Of course, if the primary judge were prepared to entertain a submission that he would not be able to bring an open mind to the resolution of the proceeding in the light of his Honour's earlier rulings both on the disputed evidence and in the final decision, it would be a matter for his Honour to decide whether he considered it was appropriate for the proceeding to be referred to another judge for a retrial ab initio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 12 Similarly, if the primary judge were persuaded that the conduct of the hearing to date was such that the admission of any part of the disputed evidence that his Honour was disposed to admit would cause injustice, it would be a matter for his Honour as to whether the trial should, for that reason, be aborted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The primary judge should be regarded as being in the same position as he would have been in had he not made the ruling of 31 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It is clear from the context that the term "rulings" in [10] is a reference to rulings on evidence and procedure and not substantive findings, as to which see [11]-[12] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">5 Cadbury applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the Full Court's remission of the matter to the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The application was refused: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] HCATrans 468.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">6 After hearing further argument the Full Court made orders in relation to costs of the appeal: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 ( Full Court III ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Full Court ordered that Darrell Lea pay Cadbury's costs other than its costs of and associated with grounds 1-14 inclusive, 17 and 18 of the amended notice of appeal, and that Cadbury pay Darrell Lea's costs of and associated with those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">7 Their Honours in Full Court III noted at [8] that at the hearing of the appeal some grounds of the amended notice of appeal were abandoned by Cadbury, namely grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18, and that grounds 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which raised challenges to substantive findings of the trial judge, were pressed only formally at the hearing of the appeal and were rejected by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">8 On the further hearing Cadbury called its three experts and they were cross-examined by senior counsel for Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Darrell Lea had filed an affidavit by an expert in the same area, a Mr Hall, but did not read his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Nature and purpose of the present hearing 
 
9 Against that background, an initial question has been raised as to the findings made in the earlier judgment under the heading Summary of Findings at [95] to [112] as follows (I have added cross-references indicating grounds in Cadbury's amended notice of appeal which challenge the finding or seek a different finding on the same topic): 
 95 The evidence warrants the following findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">96 There is wide awareness amongst Australian consumers of the use by Cadbury of a dark purple colour (i) in connection with the marketing, packaging and presentation of certain chocolate products particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk and other block milk chocolate products, and (ii) as a corporate colour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">[Grounds 1, 2] 97 Cadbury does not have an exclusive reputation in the use of this dark purple colour in connection with chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Other traders have, with Cadbury's knowledge, for many years used a similar shade of purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Cadbury has not consistently enforced its alleged exclusive reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In relation to its chief competitor Nestl&eacute;, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">[Grounds 1, 2] 98 Cadbury markets many chocolate products which have little or no purple in their packaging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">99 Cadbury products, regardless of the presence or absence of purple in the packaging, always bear the Cadbury name in a distinctive script.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">[Ground 2] 100 Cadbury's use of purple in marketing advertising and promotion is, and is seen by consumers to be, inextricably bound up with the well known name Cadbury in its distinctive script.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Cadbury never uses the colour purple in isolation as an indicium of trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">[Ground 2] 101 Cadbury products, with insignificant exceptions, are not sold at retail level at premises owned or occupied by Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">[Grounds 6, 7, 8] 102 Cadbury's marketing of chocolate heavily emphasises specific products and in particular Cadbury Dairy Milk block chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">[Ground 8] 103 Darrell Lea is a name well known in connection with chocolate in those parts of Australia where it operates, even though not as well known as Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">[Ground 10] 104 The names Darrell Lea and Cadbury are quite distinct in sound and appearance (especially with the respective scripts the parties have adopted) and not likely to be mistaken for each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">There has been particular use at Christmas 2000 to 2004 inclusive and also uses at other times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Such usage has diminished and purple has been to a significant extent replaced by blue since 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">[Ground 12] 106 Darrell Lea did not adopt the colour purple with the intention of leading consumers to believe its products were Cadbury products or that it, or its products, had some kind of association with Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">[Grounds 3, 4, 5] 107 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in premises which it owns or occupies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Other retailing occurs from separate stands or displays in retail premises, such as newsagents, pharmacies, convenience stores and video stores.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Darrell Lea has only a minor presence in supermarkets and only, in the past, to a very limited and transient extent in the major chains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Its products are not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">[Grounds 6, 7, 8] 108 Darrell Lea's marketing gives less emphasis to particular products than does Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">[Grounds 8, 10, 11, 12] 109 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 110 Darrell Lea uses its name in a distinctive script widely and consistently in marketing, packaging and point of sale presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 111 Colour recognition or attraction can play an important part in consumer decisions to purchase chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">[Ground 9] 112 Consumer decisions to purchase chocolate are often made quickly and on impulse but not necessarily irrationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Price and brand recognition can play an important part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">[Ground 9] 

 
10 After analysing Cadbury's case I reached the following conclusions (again, references to the grounds in the amended notice of appeal are inserted):
 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">[Grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] They have distinct identities in the market place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">[Grounds 11, 12] Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">11 Since the order I made dismissing Cadbury's application was set aside, the findings at [95]-[112] and [121] have no legal binding effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Nor do they create any presumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I do not use the term "findings" to suggest the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However, it is clear from the repeated orders of the Full Court that there was not to be a new trial and the further evidence was to be limited to the three Cadbury experts and such opposing experts as Darrell Lea wished to call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Some of the findings could be the subject of rejection or modification (or enhancement) in the light of the evidence given by Cadbury's experts, or indeed evidence given at the earlier hearing, eg [96], [97], [100], [111] and [112].</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Most of the findings, however, are findings of primary fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">12 The findings should be regarded for present purposes as tentative or provisional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As directed by the Full Court, the trial is to be treated as continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Not infrequently a judge will indicate that he or she has reached tentative conclusions and states them for the benefit of counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The findings in the earlier judgment will be treated on the same basis, as an analytical framework.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Of course, this does not exclude the possibility of further findings which may be warranted by the evidence of the Cadbury experts or evidence given at the earlier hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">I now turn to summarise the evidence of the Cadbury experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Dr Gibbs 
 
13 Dr Gibbs is an Associate Professor of Marketing and Behavioural Science at the University of Melbourne's Melbourne Business School.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He holds a doctorate in Behavioural Science and Marketing from the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago (1992).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He moved to Australia from Canada in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Amongst the institutions at which he has given invited presentations are Harvard, Cornell, University College Dublin, and Oxford and Cambridge Universities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">14 His two affidavits extend over 90 pages, including exhibits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The thrust of his evidence is summarized in an "Executive Summary" at pars 28-31 of his first affidavit as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">(Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Definitions provided elsewhere in the first affidavit are summarized and indicated in brackets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">)
 28 Cadbury, the leading brand in chocolate confectionery in Australia, has deliberately and consistently used the colour Cadbury purple as a key branding element for its Cadbury Dairy Milk brand and its corporate Cadbury brand since at least the late 1980s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">As a result, the colour purple is strongly associated with the Cadbury brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Purple signifies the brand to consumers, and can trigger the rich set of tangible and intangible but meaningful brand judgments, attitudes, concepts, and feelings that are associated with the Cadbury brand in the mind of the consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In this sense, purple is an activator of Cadbury's brand equity, and so is a brand element of considerable value to Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">29 Darrell Lea has recently made significant use of purple in relation to packaging and point of sale displays, at the same time as it has focused on a new distribution strategy that goes beyond its traditional dedicated shops and seeks to take advantage of "convenience" distribution channels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">30 In my opinion, Darrell Lea's use of purple is likely to cause four information-processing errors to occur among consumers of chocolate confectionery, and these errors are likely to cause harm to Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Misidentification and miscuing are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer choice; misinference and misassociation are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 30.1 Misidentification is when consumers seeking to buy Cadbury chocolate mistakenly identify a Darrell Lea product as a Cadbury product, and therefore buy the Darrell Lea product by mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Harm to Cadbury from misidentification can take the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea, induced "trailing" of Darrell Lea's products, blame from consumers for the confusing common use of colour by the two brands, and damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury due to cognitive dissonance [a state of discomfort produced by inconsistencies between simultaneously held beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour] or due to violated expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Although misidentification is the most obvious of the consumer errors likely to be experienced by reason of Darrell Lea's conduct, I believe it is the least significant, all things considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">30.2 Miscuing is when consumers use purple as a spurious cue in decision making and choice; in this capacity the colour can function as a decision-heuristic [a shorthand decision rule or "rule of thumb" functioning to reduce decision-making effort while maintaining an adequate level of accuracy] cue, an operant-conditioning [a form of learning in which modification of behaviour is brought about by the consequences that followed upon the occurrence of the behaviour in the past (for example, reward)] cue, or a behaviour-instigating cue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Harm to Cadbury from miscuing takes the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">30.3 Misinference is when consumers, in trying to make sense of the common use of purple by Darrell Lea and Cadbury, draw mistaken inferences about one or both of the brands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Harm to Cadbury from misinference can take the form of enhanced consumer attitudes towards its competitor Darrell Lea, reduced brand control by Cadbury, and perhaps, damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">30.4 Misassociation is when consumers mistakenly link Cadbury brand associations with Darrell Lea, and vice versa, as a result of the two brands' associative networks [a framework for understanding how pieces of semantic information interact in an individual's memory in which concepts or other information stored in memory are represented by nodes that are interconnected in a network of links] having become connected in consumers' minds through the common use of purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Harm to Cadbury from misassociation can take the form of reduced mean positivity of Cadbury associations, dilution of the Cadbury brand, reduced differentiation between Cadbury and Darrell Lea, reduced brand control by Cadbury, a strengthening of Darrell Lea's brand, and perhaps, emboldened competitors in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">All things considered, I believe misassociation is the most significant of the consumer errors likely to be experienced by reason of Darrell Lea's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 
 31 In my opinion, Darrell Lea's use of purple has two additional types of effect, and these effects are also likely to cause harm to Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 31.1 Errors analogous to the judgement errors (misinference and misassociation) that are made by consumers may likewise be made by retailers, investors, and Cadbury employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Harm to Cadbury from these errors may take the form of reduced Cadbury reputation and leverage in the distribution channel (retailers), reduced valuations of the Cadbury brand (investors), and reduced morale in the Cadbury workforce (employees).</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">31.2 The use of purple by Darrell Lea is likely to reduce the perceptual distinctiveness of Cadbury products, and this may also cause harm to Cadbury in the form of lost sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">
 


A number of detailed sections followed the Executive Summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The following summary is taken from Full Court I at [22] et seq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">22 First, the affidavit dealt with general marketing concepts and theories under five headings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It is desirable to summarise what Dr Gibbs said about them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The brand concept and brand equity: 23 In contemporary marketing theory and practice a brand is understood to be an essentially psychological entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">A brand is a set of associations in the mind of the consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The importance and value of a brand to its owner lies in the ability of this mentally held set of associations to influence consumer behaviour, especially information processing associated with product perception, evaluation and choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Consumers often buy the brand rather than the product itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The brand transcends the product in that extra dimensions have been added to the core product in order to differentiate it from other products designed to satisfy the same needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Such differentiation may be based on tangible, rational differences related to product performance or on intangible differences of an emotional or symbolic nature related to what the brand represents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">A brand can be highly valuable to its owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The notion of the value attributable to a brand is captured by the concept of brand equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Nature and storage of brand associations in memory: 24 An essential function of memory is to draw together similar experiences to enable one to discover patterns in one's interactions with the environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Thus, memory serves to make current perceptions meaningful by relating them to knowledge that has been distilled from previous experiences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In the field of consumer behaviour, the issue of how brand associations are stored in the minds of consumers and accessed by them, as they form judgments and make decisions, is typically understood in terms of "the associative-network model of memory".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">That type of model has a long history in psychology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">On that model, a brand is conceptualised as a set of nodes that represent concepts or other information stored in memory and are interconnected in a network of links.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This network of nodes in memory can include a wide variety of brand associations, which are created through actual use of the branded product or through exposure to advertising or other marketing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Those networked associations comprise all the explicit or implicit pieces of knowledge that the consumer retains about the brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">25 Brand associations are formed in the mind of a consumer through a process of learning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">However, not all such consumer learning is conscious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">A key feature of associative-network models is the concept of spreading activation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Nodes vary in their activation levels, with some nodes having more activation and others having less at any given moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">A node is activated when the consumer perceives a stimulus or cue corresponding to that node.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The extent to which activation spreads between two nodes depends on how closely they are linked in the associative network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The associative network conceptualisation of brands has two particularly important marketing implications as follows: 
 
 &#8226; The complex amalgam of activated nodes in a consumer's associative network for a particular brand is what constitutes the brand's meaning or image for that consumer and is the basis for the brand's brand equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It is therefore a crucial responsibility of brand management to maintain control over what associations become linked into the brand's network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">&#8226; Because typically only a subset of nodes in a brand's network is activated at once, a brand's meaning or image is not fixed, even for a given consumer, but varies with the cues or activators present in the specific context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">This context sensitivity of brand meaning creates the potential for the strategic activation of specific portions of the associative network, and a great deal of marketing effort can be understood as being directed at activating some portions of the network and not activating others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">However, certain nodes in a brand's network, by virtue of being easily and strongly cued or closely linked to many other nodes in the network, can serve as "primes" or "triggers" to prompt consumers to retrieve a full range of brand associations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A major responsibility of marketing management and practice, therefore, is to establish such primes or triggers, often in the form of tangible brand elements, such as names, logos, symbols, slogans, signage and packages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Role of packaging as a marketing communication: 26 Brand elements, along with other distinctive aspects of product form and packaging, such as colour, can be powerful cues for the activation of the set of associations linked to a brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Exposure to such brand elements generally triggers recall of the brand's attributes and benefits as well as stored attitudes and emotions associated with the brand as a result of the consumer's exposure to past promotion, purchase and use of the brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Product form and packaging is one of the most important ways by which consumers recognise and respond to many brands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Packaging can influence consumers in at least three ways: 
 
 &#8226; by attracting attention;
 &#8226; by identifying the brand; and
 &#8226; by conveying meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
 These packaging influences are reinforced and leveraged by other forms of consumer contact, such as advertising and point-of-purchase displays, all of which together are considered the brand's integrated marketing communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Importance and impact of colour: 27 Colour should not be viewed as just a trivial element of package design or of marketing communications more generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The power of colour as a marketing tool is considerable and marketers make heavy use of colour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Colour can have very basic effects on information processing, even at a sensory or physiological level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Thus, colour can affect the subjective sensation of temperature and can also affect time perception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Colour has a special status in visual information processing because colour, as a basic visual feature, is perceived automatically, prior to the allocation of focal attention to specific locations in the visual field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Thus, consumers can register the colour of a package rapidly and effortlessly and yet not perceive the conjunction of that colour with other packaging elements, such as the brand logo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">28 Purple may have particular potency as a visual stimulus, in so far as it is a relatively uncommon colour in the environment, because: 
 
 &#8226; scarcity can signal preciousness;
 &#8226; uncommon stimuli are more conspicuous to consumers and hence have a greater potential for influencing consumer behaviour;
 &#8226; uncommon stimuli will receive greater weight in the consumer's decision making process; and
 &#8226; uncommon stimuli may also be more useful for cueing the brand or specific brand associations.</sentence>

<sentence id="s166">Convenience goods and consumer involvement: 29 The majority of confectionary products sold in mainstream channels are classified by marketers and consumer behaviourists as convenience goods, which are goods usually purchased relatively frequently, immediately and with a minimum of effort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">For any given consumer, it is likely that chocolate confectionary may be a routine or staple purchase on some occasions (such as buying chocolates as a regular treat for children's school lunches) and an impulse purchase on other occasions, depending on a variety of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Many categories of convenience goods are purchased by consumers under conditions of low consumer involvement, which is generally thought to reflect the degree of perceived self-relevance, be it intrinsic or situation specific, of an object to a consumer, based on the consumer's needs, values and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Buying behaviour for low-involvement goods often becomes somewhat habitualised and even automated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">30 Consumers rely on, and respond to, familiar brand cues within product categories and do not go through a complex process of comparison and evaluation of competing products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">When involvement is lower, consumers acquire information more narrowly and rely more heavily on brands and salient brand cues to expedite product selection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">For many selections made under these circumstances, the consumer actually scans the display and identifies and selects the target product at some distance from the shelf, based on recognition of the packaging of the familiar usual brand being sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Under those circumstances, the most salient visual cues, such as package size, shape and colour, are usually the predominant stimuli upon which consumers rely to identify brands and to optimise their time spent shopping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In the context of an impulse purchase, consumers also pay rather limited attention to detail, responding more strongly to the immediacy of the most salient cues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Cadbury and Darrell Lea brands 31 Dr Gibbs' affidavit then dealt with the Cadbury brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It did so by reference to consumer research materials provided to him by Cadbury's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Those materials consisted of some 25 separate reports that were compendiously referred to as "document Q".</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Document Q was not in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Although Cadbury sought to prove the materials in document Q, the evidence was rejected because it was not filed in accordance with the directions given by the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">32 Dr Gibbs also included a section on the Darrell Lea brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">No particular exception seems to have been taken in relation to the material in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The consumer information-processing errors 33 The most significant and most contentious part of Dr Gibbs' principal affidavit then follows in six sections headed as follows: 
 
 &#8226; OVERVIEW: FOUR CONSUMER INFORMATION-PROCESSING ERRORS CAUSED BY DARRELL LEA'S USE OF CADBURY PURPLE AND RESULTING HARM TO CADBURY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">
 &#8226; ERROR I: MISIDENTIFICATION.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">
 &#8226; ERROR II: MISCUING.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">
 &#8226; ERROR III: MISINFERENCE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">
 &#8226; ERROR IV: MISASSOCIATION.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 &#8226; ADDITIONAL EFFECTS AND ISSUES.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">
 
 34 Significant parts of the disputed evidence are directed to describing what Dr Gibbs perceives to be the harm to Cadbury from the errors that he describes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">They describe the consequences of consumers being misled or deceived by Darrell Lea's use of the colour purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">That was a basis of complaint by Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">35 Dr Gibbs began his overview by saying that viewing the effects of Darrell Lea's use of purple in terms of consumer information-processing errors provides a useful unifying framework for understanding those effects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">He expressed the opinion that Darrell Lea's use of purple in its marketing and sales activities is likely to cause the four errors to occur among consumers of chocolate confectionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">He explained that those four errors can be classified along two dimensions: whether they involve consumer choice or consumer judgment, and whether the relevant information processing is primarily conscious or primarily unconscious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Misidentification and miscuing relate, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Misinference and misassociation relate, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">While some forms of those errors cannot occur simultaneously in the same consumer, the four effects are not mutually exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">36 Dr Gibbs then dealt with the four consumer information processing errors, each of which he said is "likely to result from Darrell Lea's use of Cadbury purple".</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">As indicated above, there was no evidence that Dr Gibbs had any direct knowledge of Darrell Lea's use of purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">His understanding of that use was based on photographs provided to him by Cadbury's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The photographs, which were in evidence, were of various Darrell Lea products as displayed in a newsagent, a tobacconist, a convenience store of some type and a store owned by Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">37 Dr Gibbs said that the photographs show: 
 
 &#8226; A number of Darrell Lea branded products that use significant amounts of purple in their packaging;
 &#8226; A number of other unidentified products in the shape of a flat tray or typical box of chocolates, included within Darrell Lea displays, that have been wrapped for display using purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Often those purple wrapped boxes have been stacked in piles on display shelves, with the effect of creating definite areas of purple as a significant feature of the overall display;
 &#8226; Headboard signage for Darrell Lea that uses purple as the predominant background colour;
 &#8226; Point of sale materials, cardboard displays, using purple; and
 &#8226; Staff uniforms, including aprons, featuring purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 
 38 Dr Gibbs expressed the opinion that the use of purple by Darrell Lea, that he thus briefly describes, is likely to have the result that: 
 
 &#8226; Consumers seeking to buy Cadbury chocolate will mistakenly identify a Darrell Lea product as a Cadbury product;
 &#8226; Consumers utilising purple as a cue in decision making and choice will end up purchasing Darrell Lea chocolate and not the Cadbury chocolate that the cue was based on;
 &#8226; Consumers will draw mistaken inferences about the Cadbury and Darrell Lea brands that the common use of purple is cooperative and that there is some kind of corporate relationship between Cadbury and Darrell Lea; and
 &#8226; Consumers will mistakenly link Cadbury brand associations with Darrell Lea, and vice versa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 39 Finally, Dr Gibbs also expressed his opinion about additional effects by reason of the influence of Darrell Lea's use of purple on decision makers other than consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Thus, Dr Gibbs suggested that retailers may notice and react to the described potential for weakening of the Cadbury brand and business and Cadbury may consequently experience a loss of reputation and leverage in the distribution channel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Those effects appear to be further instances of harm that would be caused to Cadbury by reason of errors analogous to the four consumer information-processing errors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Dr Stavros 
 
15 Dr Stavros is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing in the Business Portfolio of RMIT University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">He has taught there since 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Although he has taught across a range of marketing areas, his specialty, and the subject of his doctoral dissertation, is the study of long-term relationships between professional sporting organisations and consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">He came to the notice of Cadbury when he was interviewed on the Neil Mitchell program on 3AW and volunteered the view that Cadbury has "done such a great job of making themselves synonymous [with the colour purple], in fact so synonymous at the moment in the middle of a legal proceedings --- legal proceedings to try and take ownership of that colour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">16 The evidence of Dr Stavros substantially overlapped with that of Dr Gibbs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">He said that a brand is a "set of complex offerings and associations that reside in the mind of the customer or consumer", the significance of which to its owner lies in its "psychological and behavioural effects" which influence the decision making of consumers with regard to "perceived value, product identification, risk reduction and buying process evaluation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">17 He discussed the concept of "involvement" in the consumer context which he defined as "the level of personal relevance to the consumer of the product category and/or the purchase decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">In the case of a "low-involvement" product, the consumer "perceives little risk in purchasing the product and may do so relatively automatically and committing little time or mental resources to search, evaluation or consideration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Chocolate confectionery will often be regarded as such a low involvement purchase, "made by many consumers without pre-planning and on impulse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Colour of packaging was "a more critical factor in low-involvement purchasing than in high-involvement decisions, as it becomes a more prominent factor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">18 He considered that Cadbury's marketing actions had developed a strong brand identity linked to elements including the name in the distinctive script, the glass and a half image and the colour Cadbury purple and that "while all these elements taken together sum up the Cadbury brand they do also stand individually as key elements of the Cadbury brand".</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In his opinion "it is not necessary for all three elements to be present for consumers to recognise a brand".</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In cross-examination he described the Cadbury brand as "iconic".</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">19 He said he would show his students a slide which only featured the colour purple and they would respond "often as a chorus" with "Cadbury", which in his view demonstrated a "strong, enduring relationship between the colour purple and Cadbury".</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">20 He distinguished the use of purple in the packaging of third party products such as Milka, Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble as "product specific instances of the use of a colour, rather than a corporate or master branding or mega branding approach".</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Mr Riches 
 
21 Mr Riches is the Managing Director of FutureBrand FHA Pty Ltd which is a branding and design consultancy within the Interpublic Group of Companies, the world's largest marketing services group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">He holds degrees in Law and Arts (philosophy major) from Monash University and a Graduate Diploma in Business (Marketing) from RMIT University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">22 At the time he swore his first affidavit in November 2005 he had been with FutureBrand for six years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He has been responsible for major branding projects with clients including Tourism Australia, BHP Billiton, Streets, Sensis, ANZ Bank and the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">23 Mr Riches defined a brand as
 the set of perceptions and associations that exist in a person's mind in relation to a product, service or other branded object (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">a person, a country, a cause or a sport) which influence that person's predisposition towards that product either positively or negatively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">These perceptions and associations ... add a "layer" of additional value to the product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">24 He described how corporations use brands to create business value in three broad ways, (i) by market share and/or profit margin, in attracting more customers and sales and driving price premium and thus more profit per sale, (ii) by customer retention and (iii) by innovation and extension, with new products carrying an existing brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">He explained in detail how corporations, with the assistance of his firm, implement "brand management" practices, including taking "a disciplined approach to the management of their face to the market".</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">25 He said that a "brand identity system" will contain "brand identity elements" such as a logo, distinctive typefaces, a colour palette (a limited range of colours), distinctive graphic devices and tone of voice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Such a brand identity element can be thought of as a "hook", that is to say "a simple thing on which the brand owner or marketer can 'hang' a more complex set of associations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">26 He said that as a brand identity element, colour can have "particular uses and benefits in helping to build strong brands", for example red and the combination of red and white for Coca-Cola and yellow and red for Shell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">In a competitive, crowded and visually cluttered retail environment, colour can achieve "'shelf presence'... in the otherwise highly fragmented and confusing landscape of, say, a supermarket aisle" and can alone identify a brand to a consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In Cadbury's case, colour was the most important brand element in "cutting through the clutter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">27 Mr Riches gave evidence of FutureBrand's involvement in Cadbury's promotions at the 2000 Sydney Olympics (see earlier judgment at [24], [88]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">He said that "the colour purple was Cadbury's most flexible and powerful brand identity element (and of far more utility than other Cadbury brand elements such as the glass and a half logo)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">28 He considered that Cadbury's "Masterbrand/Megabrand" strategy had a "systematic approach (which) has featured the use of purple as a widely recognisable brand identity element".</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">29 He said that Cadbury had deliberately sought to associate purple with its Dairy Milk brand and that ingredient had been "'leveraged' across the product range with the intention of communicating quality and other product associations that attach to Cadbury Dairy Milk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">30 People in the marketing industry, according to Mr Riches, described the association between Cadbury and purple as the "top of the mind" example of a strong brand colour association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It was "marketing folklore".</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">31 In his view, none of the third party users of purple such as Violet Crumble "have ever come close to dominating the chocolate confectionery market in the same way as Cadbury Dairy Milk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The use of purple was "unusual" in supermarkets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Darrell Lea criticism of the Cadbury experts 
 
32 Darrell Lea pointed out that Dr Gibbs admitted having made no specific study of the confectionery industry in Australia and being completely reliant on facts supplied to him by Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">He had only lived in Australia for some two years prior to swearing his first affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">He visited a Darrell Lea store in September 2005 and had no prior knowledge of Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">33 Dr Stavros also had no specialist experience of the marketing of confectionery in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">He had never been involved in the marketing of any confectionery product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">His specialty in the relationships of sporting organisations seems well removed from the marketing of day-to-day consumer products, let alone confectionery in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">As already noted, his recruitment as an expert seems to have been prompted by his volunteering some preconceived ideas about Cadbury and the colour purple on a popular radio program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">He visited two Darrell Lea stores in about October 2005, one in Chadstone and one in the city of Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">34 Mr Riches' direct involvement with Cadbury was limited to the Sydney 2000 Olympics promotional campaign, and then in the role of planning and design rather than the actual selling of chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">He is not a specialist in the confectionery sector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In connection with the Olympics campaign he visited "a supermarket and, I think, a couple of convenience style outlets which had a significant weight of confectionery and chocolate product on display".</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">After receiving instructions from Cadbury's solicitors he visited a Darrell Lea store in October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">35 The Cadbury experts' uniform lack of practical experience in the retail confectionery market is consistent with Cadbury's case as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Nobody has given evidence of actually buying or selling chocolate at the retail level, or observing or enquiring of those who do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Darrell Lea does not suggest the Cadbury experts' evidence is inadmissible for this (or any other) reason, but the admitted deficiency in market knowledge does go to weight, especially in a context where the Court is entitled, and bound, to form its own opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">36 The Cadbury experts relied on documentary material such as photographs of Cadbury and Darrell Lea stores and products (Document M in Exhibit Z) and instructions from Cadbury's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">As already mentioned, they also made some store visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">However, as far as the evidence goes, the visits were limited to inspection of the goods on display and physical surroundings and did not involve any observation of consumer behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">37 Darrell Lea submitted that there were many matters about Cadbury and Darrell Lea and the marketplace as to which the Cadbury experts were not instructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Senior counsel for Darrell Lea put these matters as features of what he called Marketplace B, the real retail confectionery market, as distinct from Marketplace A, the marketplace as to which the Cadbury experts were instructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">These matters included:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Darrell Lea's use of the lighter purple shade "boysenberry" for ten years, a usage not objected to by Cadbury; 
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The particular "Christmas-oriented focus" of the use of purple by Darrell Lea at Christmas 2000-2004;
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The "store-in-store" Darrell Lea sites (ie in other premises as distinct from stand alone stores where the witnesses admitted consumer confusion would be unlikely), to which Darrell Lea argued more attention should have been paid; 
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The fact that about 70 per cent of Darrell Lea's sales were at its stand alone stores (earlier judgment at [35]); 
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">A lot of the selling from the store-in-stores was gift-oriented and thus not a case of "low involvement" purchasing; 
 
6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Cadbury and Darrell Lea products were not sold side by side (earlier judgment [88]-[89]); 
 
7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">There were different product lines, eg Darrell Lea did not sell block chocolate (Mr Riches had mistakenly assumed the contrary); 
 
8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Third party usage of purple for chocolate marketing (earlier judgment [52]-[68]); 
 
9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">A majority (56 per cent) of Cadbury sales were of products marketed in colours other than dark purple (earlier judgment [22], [98]); 
 
10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">No sales of Cadbury products occurred without the presence of brand names and symbols (earlier judgment [82]-[87]); 
 
11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Price sensitivity and product choice (earlier judgment [92]-[93]); 
 
12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Cadbury's own use of purple in its marketing was based on internal marketing reports which were not admitted in evidence for the truth of their contents; 
 
13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">No evidence of consumers actually being misled (earlier judgment [80]-[81]); 
 
14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">No evidence of loss of Cadbury sales or increase in Darrell Lea sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">38 Cadbury's response was that these matters were either not put to the Cadbury experts in cross-examination or, where they were put, there was no challenge to the witnesses' opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">As an example of the latter situation, Dr Stavros had said in his second affidavit (par 88.2) that:
 It must be possible to assess the extent of such a marketing advantage by comparing Darrell Lea's sales before using the colour purple (in a shade which consumers recognise as similar to or the same as Cadbury purple), to Darrell Lea's sales after such use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">My expectation is that such sales would increase ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">In cross-examination about that passage he was asked: 
 ... but you agree with me, don't you, that you don't know of any underlying research that supports the proposition that Darrell Lea's use of purple causes any harm at all to Cadbury?</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">--- I don't know of any specific research, but I am trying to draw inferences in my affidavit as to the potential damage that could be done to Darrell ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The answer is, you don't know of any such research?</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">--- No, not of any such research.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">And you say it's a field that could be researched?</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">--- I think it's possible to assess that, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">There are other instances where the Cadbury experts conceded that a certain matter was "relevant" or "capable of being researched" or that particular research would be "helpful".</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">39 Cadbury submitted that if Darrell Lea wished to challenge or qualify the conclusions reached by the witness on the basis of different factual assumptions the Rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 required the cross-examiner to ask the witness whether such matters resulted in any change to his opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">40 As well as Browne v Dunn itself, Cadbury cited in support of this proposition the decision of the Full Court in Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">That case concerned an appeal from a jury's conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of his second wife and murder of her lover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Evidence was given by a Mr Saulwick of a survey of persons in the Australian Capital Territory as to their knowledge of the appellant's conviction five years earlier of the manslaughter of his first wife and the effect any such knowledge would have on their opinion as to his likely guilt of a similar offence in relation to the second wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">This evidence was adduced in support of an application for leave to challenge jurors as to cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">There was discussion at 557 by Drummond J (with whom Davies and Miles JJ agreed) critical of the usefulness of the survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">In substance his Honour found it was not useful and not a sufficient basis for its conclusion that at least one member of the jury would have connected the appellant with the 1987 killing and, for that reason, would have found the appellant guilty of the 1992 offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Davies J at 551-552 also gave reasons for his conclusion that the survey questions were "misconceived".</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Mr Saulwick was cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It may be that some matters relied on by their Honours were not put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">For example, in making the point that the sample was drawn from ACT voters and not the more limited population of the ACT eligible for jury service Drummond J said at 557: "This may or may not affect Mr Saulwick's opinion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">If anything, the case seems contrary to Cadbury's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">In any event, Browne v Dunn is not mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">41 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15:
 The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554---7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26---7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207---8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119---20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued:

 The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">42 Likewise in Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 236 Mahoney JA said:
 ...failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">This was pointed out by Lord Herschell ([in Browne v Dunn] at 71).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The nature of the defendant's case and the particulars given, and otherwise the conduct of it may make it sufficiently clear that such an assumption is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice concerning the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">43 As to the application of Browne v Dunn in modern commercial litigation, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR (Digest) |P 46-183 at 50,323, approved on appeal: J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [103] - [107] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">44 In the present case there was the unusual situation that Cadbury was on notice from the earlier judgment of what factual matters were claimed by Darrell Lea to bear on the passing off and trade practices claims --- and indeed what matters the trial judge had considered to be relevant and important, such as, for example, price sensitivity and product choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Cadbury was in a position to obtain instructions from its experts as to their views on these matters and the effect, if any, on their opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">As well as the affidavits sworn before the trial, the Cadbury experts all swore affidavits in August 2007, that is after the earlier judgment and the Full Court's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Moreover, any response to the matters put by Darrell Lea could have been elicited in re-examination (as in fact occurred in respect of one matter put to Dr Gibbs).</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">There was no unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">45 As to the features of Darrell Lea's "Marketplace B" ([37] above), Cadbury challenged the factual accuracy or relevance (or both) of items 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 but not the remainder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Putting aside for the purposes of argument the challenged items, I think Darrell Lea's criticism is valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The role of the Cadbury experts in the resumed hearing 
 
46 The evidence of the Cadbury experts had been excluded ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 363 at [8] - [18] ) on the ground that an expert's opinion is not admissible as to matters within the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury ( The Queen v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841, Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28 ; (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111) and specifically in relation to "ordinary human nature, that of people at large" ( Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119) such as purchasers of everyday consumer items ( Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527, Symonds Cider &amp; English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] IEHC 1 at [20] ); see also JD Heydon Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) at 930.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">47 While that is probably correct as a matter of common law, embarrassingly for myself and counsel (not including Mr Hutley SC and Mr Rebikoff, who did not appear at the earlier trial) nobody adverted to s 80 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which provides that opinion evidence is not inadmissible only because it is about a fact in issue or an ultimate issue or a matter of common knowledge: see Full Court I at [49], [52], [54].</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">48 Nevertheless s 80 of the Evidence Act deals only with the admissibility of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">It does not affect the approach to particular kinds of evidence in particular categories of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] in the context of a s 52 and passing off case (and well after the introduction of the Evidence Act ), Branson J, after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection, said:
 However, I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case, which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public, I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely 'impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">These observations are not intended in any way to belittle the importance of market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour in other types of cases and for other purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">49 In Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] , a Full Court of this Court cited the above passage with approval and continued:
 22 Consideration of these difficulties shows the practical wisdom of the firm rule that the likelihood of conduct being misleading or deceptive is a question for the tribunal of fact and not for any witness to decide: General Electric Co (USA) v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729 at 738 per Lord Diplock, applied in a s 52 context by Gummow J, with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed, in Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">23 Lord Diplock points out in General Electric that a different rule applies in the case of sales not to the general public but in specialised markets concerning persons engaged in a particular trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">In the present case the relevant market is that in which the consumers are business users of domain names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Such users constitute large sections of the public and are not participants in a specialised market in the sense discussed by Lord Diplock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">50 In Interlego AG v Croner Trader Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 Gummow J also said at 387:
 The issue of whether consumers have been or are likely to be deceived was described by Lord Diplock as a "jury question": General Electric Co (of USA) v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729; [1972] 2 All ER 507.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">His Lordship said (at 738; 515): 

 
 
 [W]here goods are sold to the general public for consumption or domestic use, the question whether such buyers would be likely to be deceived or confused by the use of the trademark is a 'jury question'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">By that I mean: that if the issue had now, as formerly, to be tried by a jury, who as members of the general public would themselves be potential buyers of the goods, they would be required not only to consider any evidence of other members of the public which had been adduced but also to use their own common sense and to consider whether they would themselves be likely to be deceived or confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">
 


 
 
 The question does not cease to be a 'jury question' when the issue is tried by a judge alone or on appeal by a plurality of judges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The judge's approach to the question should be the same as that of a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He, too, would be a potential buyer of the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">He should, of course, be alert to the danger of allowing his own idiosyncratic knowledge or temperament to influence his decision, but the whole of his training in the practice of the law should have accustomed him to this, and this should provide the safety which in the case of a jury is provided by their number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">That in issues of this kind judges are entitled to give effect to their own opinions as to the likelihood of deception or confusion and, in doing so, are not confined to the evidence of witnesses called at the trial is well established by the decisions of this House itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">
 


 
51 Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It was put that by choosing not to adduce any expert evidence, Darrell Lea "effectively accepts the (Cadbury) expert evidence" and that in accordance with Browne v Dunn "Darrell Lea is now estopped from making any submissions that the expert evidence is incorrect".</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">I do not accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">In Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278, a copyright infringement case concerning house plans, Street J said at 286:
 In view of the volume of expert evidence, and the differing views expressed by the expert witnesses, I should state the use that can properly be made of that evidence in reaching a decision in a suit such as this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">The decision upon the issue of similarity is an original decision for the court itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">It is to be reached upon an assessment of such similarities and dissimilarities as appear to the court between the plans or buildings under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">The fact that one particular expert of the highest authority and of unimpeachable credit is permitted to swear to an opinion on similarity or dissimilarity does not relieve the court of the responsibility of forming its own opinion on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">In this sense the expert evidence in a suit such as the present fills a somewhat unusual role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">It is almost as if each side calls an expert to argue out with counsel in examination-in-chief and cross-examination the similarity or dissimilarity which that particular expert sees between the plans and houses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">By attending to the progress of this argumentative process between counsel and expert the court is enabled to perceive and more readily to appreciate the points of similarity and dissimilarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">In this way the tendering of expert evidence is of value in exposing the facets of the ultimate question to which the expert opinion evidence is directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">But the important point is that, in distinction from the judicial process in relation to expert evidence such as is normally encountered in litigation, a court in the present type of litigation is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to form and act on its own original opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">His Honour's approach would seem to apply a fortiori in a case concerning the retail marketing of everyday consumer products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Revisiting the findings in the earlier judgment 
 
52 A convenient way to deal with the evidence is to revisit the findings at [95]-[112] and [121] of the earlier judgement (see [9] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">I again stress that in themselves they are not legally binding and do not create any presumptions, although the overall burden of proof in the case remains of course on Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">53 Wide awareness of Cadbury's use of purple [96].</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Cadbury's case implicitly is that this is an understatement of the importance of purple to its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Cadbury purple is said to be "iconic" and a major element in its "brand equity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">In Dr Gibbs' view purple is "strongly associated with the Cadbury brand" and can "trigger the rich set of tangible and intangible but meaningful brand judgements, attitudes, concepts, and feelings that are associated with the Cadbury brand in the mind of the consumer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">54 Characterisation of a brand element as "iconic" or otherwise has no legal significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">I accept that there is a widespread association in consumers' minds between Cadbury's business and its chocolate products and the colour purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">55 Non-exclusive reputation in the use of purple [97].</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The background to this issue is that Cadbury originally pleaded in par 10 of its statement of claim that it had achieved "a substantial, exclusive and valuable reputation and goodwill" in the colour purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">This alleged exclusivity was denied by Darrell Lea and became the subject of substantial evidence and disputation at the trial: see earlier judgment at [52]-[68].</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">56 The case was argued on the common assumption that there was no relevant difference between the passing off and trade practices causes of action: earlier judgment at [117].</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Indeed, Cadbury's final submissions at the present hearing asserted that its trade practices claims were "coextensive with its passing off claim".</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">However in Full Court I at [99] it was pointed out that there was no requirement of exclusivity in relation to the trade practices claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Their Honours said:
 The question is not whether an applicant has shown a sufficient reputation in a particular get-up or name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The question is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant's product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of the knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant's product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">57 After the Full Court's judgment Cadbury obtained leave to amend its statement of claim by deleting "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">However, lack of exclusivity remains relevant at a factual level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The more extensive a plaintiff's reputation, the easier it will be to show that any contrary message that might be conveyed to consumers by third party usage can be discounted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Conversely, knowledge of third party usage can impact on the likelihood or otherwise of consumers being misled or deceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The hypothetical reasonable chocolate consumer could think along these lines:
 Purple makes me think of Cadbury chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">But I know that other chocolate makers' products such as Violet Crumble use purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">So Cadbury does not have a monopoly in the use of purple for chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Seeing chocolate in a purple wrapper with Darrell Lea's name on it in a Darrell Lea shop does not makes me think it comes from Cadbury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">58 Cadbury submitted that the failure of Darrell Lea to adduce evidence (expert or lay) as to the effect that third party use of purple has adversely impacted Cadbury's reputation in Cadbury purple meant that the Court ought to draw a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference that any evidence it might have sought to adduce would not have assisted its case in this respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">There was substantial evidence of the fact of third party usage given by Darrell Lea's Mr Michael Lea (earlier judgment [52]-[54]) and evidence of Cadbury's "Co-existence Agreement" with Nestl&eacute; under which Cadbury agreed not to object to Nestl&eacute;'s use of get-ups for Violet Crumble (a chocolate-coated honeycomb bar which might be said to verge on the iconic), Wonka, Quality Street and Polly Waffle, all of which featured purple ([55]-[56]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">For its part Cadbury adduced evidence of its efforts to restrain third party usage, which met with mixed success ([57]-[67]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">There was evidence of actual third party usage in the present case sufficient for the Court to make its own findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">59 Mr Riches said that the third party products "did not come close to dominating the chocolate confectionery market in the same way as Cadbury Dairy Milk" and that no other brand consistently used purple as a "brand identity element" in promotional campaigns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Dr Stavros thought that purple used with Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble were "product specific instances of the use of a colour, rather than a corporate or master branding or mega branding".</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">However, the lack of specialised knowledge of the confectionery market of these witnesses has already been noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">60 Dr Stavros said that some consumers would pick up a Violet Crumble, see the Nestl&eacute; brand and "make the connection between those brands [ie Nestl&eacute; and Cadbury] and be aware that there's a distinction between those organisations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">He continued:
 There's a scope though for other consumers to see the purple, relate that to the Cadbury brand and either believe that the product comes from Cadbury, or that there is some association between those organisations, I think that's possible --- it's very possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Dr Stavros' hypothesis, involving as it does a very well known non-Cadbury manufacturer and a very well known non-Cadbury product, is speculative and quite unrealistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">61 I see no reason to vary the finding at [97] of the earlier judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">I regard it as a valid and relevant fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">62 Some (a majority) of Cadbury products feature little or no purple [98].</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">I did not understand this fact to be disputed; see earlier judgment at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Dr Gibbs thought that since "the Cadbury Milk bar [sic] is --- was kind of their flagship brand and that one is --- it prominently uses purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">So in that sense I was considering the other uses to be less important in the line".</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">It is of some significance that consumers would see Cadbury as a firm which used purple a great deal, but also other colours as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">63 Cadbury products (with or without purple) always bear the "Cadbury" script [99].</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Again, this is not disputed; see earlier judgment at [11]-[13].</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">64 Use of purple seen to be bound up with the "Cadbury" script --- purple never used in isolation [100].</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The fact that purple was never used without the "Cadbury" script does not seem to be disputed; see earlier judgment [82]-[87].</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">65 The Cadbury experts said that this was irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Cadbury's expert called at the earlier trial, Professor Roger Layton, Emeritus Professor of Marketing at the University of New South Wales, clearly regarded the association of brand with colour as relevant to consumer perceptions; see earlier judgment at [77]-[78].</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">For obvious enough reasons, consumers are never presented at the point of sale with a Cadbury product, in purple or not, without the Cadbury name prominently displayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">The ordinary reasonable consumer is to be credited with awareness of this when confronted with the allegedly misleading Darrell Lea product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">66 Cadbury products not sold at Cadbury premises [101].</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">This is not disputed; see earlier judgment [9], [88].</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">67 Heavy emphasis in Cadbury marketing on specific products, particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk [102].</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">This seems to be positively advanced in Cadbury's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">68 " Darrell Lea" name well known in connection with chocolate [103].</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Apparently not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">69 Names "Darrell Lea" and "Cadbury" quite distinct in sound and appearance [104].</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Not disputed; see earlier judgment at [38]-[39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">70 Darrell Lea used purple 2000-2004 particularly at Christmas [105].</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">This of course is a central part of Cadbury's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">The Cadbury experts relied on inspection of one or two shops and viewing of photographs and information provided by Cadbury, all in late 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The value of their opinions as to what in fact happened in the marketplace in 2000-2004 must be limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">On reflection, perhaps greater weight should be accorded to the fact that the usage of which Cadbury primarily complains, that at Christmas 2000-2004, was not just of purple but a combination of purple and copper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">As one Darrell Lea witness said, speaking of Christmas time, "everything in the store was purple and copper".</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Note also Ms McGlinchey's evidence as to the choice of copper (earlier judgment at [47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">There is no suggestion Cadbury ever used copper in conjunction with purple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">This would be a relevant distinguishing feature between Cadbury and Darrell Lea in the perceptions of consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">71 Darrell Lea did not adopt purple to mislead consumers vis-a-vis Cadbury or its products [106].</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">This was a major issue at the trial; see earlier judgment at [43]-[51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">On the appeal, Cadbury's attack on this finding was abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">It cannot be affected by the opinions of the Cadbury experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Cadbury's use of statements in its written submissions in the present hearing like "Enticing consumers into the marketing web" and "The manipulation of consumer choice is a matter of expert evidence" and assertions that Darrell Lea's use of purple was "strategic, sustained" and "a departure from previous use of red and green at Christmas time, requiring decision at CEO and Board level" may be an attempt to suggest a different, or qualified, conclusion on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">If so, it must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">72 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in its own premises --- other retailing from store-in-stores --- minor presence in supermarkets and very limited in major chains --- products not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's [107].</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The evidence was that at the time of trial Darrell Lea sold its products through 126 of its own shops and 699 "store-in-store" displays (free-standing units in other shops such as newsagencies and pharmacies --- they sold a substantially smaller range than Darrell Lea's own shops).</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">About 70 per cent of sales were through the former category, but the latter were more profitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">It is likely that category of outlet will be expanded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">73 The only qualification I would make to that finding is that, in relation to the concluding sentence, the summary of evidence at [89] of the earlier judgment has some inaccuracy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Mr Selvay took his photographs in February 2006, not 2005, in five IGA supermarkets, two video stores, a pharmacy and a newsagency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">The photographs show Cadbury and Darrell Lea products within the same picture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Sometimes they are on opposite sides of an aisle and sometimes closer together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">The name "Darrell Lea" in its distinctive script appears on prominent signage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">However, the fact remains that the familiarity of Darrell Lea stand alone shops, coupled with distinctive signage in both types of outlet, would be likely to emphasise and reinforce in the minds of consumers that Darrell Lea is a different firm from Cadbury and sells different products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Ms Linda Hurst, a Darrell Lea national marketing manager, said that the shops "were the things that generated the brand imagery for Darrell Lea" (earlier judgment at [35]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Moreover, as is mentioned in the earlier judgment at [88], IGA supermarkets were minor sales outlets for Darrell Lea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">74 Darrell Lea gives less emphasis to particular products [108].</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">This does not appear to be disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Darrell Lea had no equivalent to Cadbury's flagship Cadbury Dairy Milk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">75 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate [109].</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">Again, not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">76 Darrell Lea's distinctive script widely and consistently used [110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">77 Colour recognition can play an important part in consumer chocolate-purchasing decisions [111].</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Much of the Cadbury experts' opinions were taken up with an exegesis of this theme, which ordinary experience would suggest is fairly self-evident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Although senior counsel for Cadbury said that the science of marketing is "in great part counter-intuitive" in my view the evidence in this case rather suggests the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">78 The present case concerns the use of colour in retail marketing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Ordinary experience, history and literature all tell us that colours operate as powerful stimulants of memory, identification and loyalty: "The Wearing of the Green", "The people's flag /Is deepest red".</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">So it is not surprising that attractive colours including, but not limited to, purple, play an important part in the marketing of chocolate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The science of marketing confirms this intuitive perception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">79 Another example is the concept of "brand equity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">That a brand can be, as Dr Gibbs says, highly valuable to its owners, is not particularly arcane knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">80 Consumer chocolate-purchasing decisions often quick and impulsive, but not necessarily irrational --- price and brand recognition can be important [112].</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Again this accords with much of what the Cadbury experts said about "low involvement" products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">There was evidence about the price sensitivity of Cadbury chocolate (earlier judgment at [92]-[93]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">This is significant evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">It is virtually the only evidence of actual consumer behaviour in the retail chocolate market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The fact that consumers clearly make purchasing decisions having regard to price suggests they do not act irrationally and are capable of distinguishing between differently branded products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">81 Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market [121].</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">82 Cadbury and Darrell Lea have distinctive product lines [121].</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">This is a fair conclusion; see earlier judgment at [36], [90].</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">83 Cadbury and Darrell Lea products are sold from different sorts of premises [121].</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">This is substantially correct; see earlier judgment at [88] and [72]-[73] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">84 Cadbury and Darrell Lea products are sold under distinctive trade names [121].</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">This is an important, and undisputed, fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">85 Cadbury and Darrell Lea have distinctive identities in the retail chocolate marketplace [121].</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">While no doubt conclusionary, I think this is a fair summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The law 
 
86 Cadbury's amended notice of appeal did not criticise any statement of the substantive law in the earlier judgement at [117]-[120].</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Apart from the question of exclusive reputation in trade practices claims (see [56] above) and of course the s 80 point, Full Court I does not suggest there was any incorrect statement of principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">87 In its written submissions Cadbury cited numerous decisions which were said to involve facts or issues similar to the present case and statements of judges about the facts in those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">For its part, Darrell Lea sought to draw different messages from those, and other, cases and statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Without wishing to disparage the industry of counsel, I did not find this exercise particularly helpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">I repeat the statement of Lord Oliver in Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7, quoted in the earlier judgment at [120].</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Mutatis mutandis , similar considerations apply to the trade practices claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">As was pointed out in Domain Names and Interlego (see [49]-[50] above), these are jury questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">A jury would not be asked to consider what was said by judges in other cases because a jury has to apply legal principle to the facts before it, and no other facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">88 One additional aspect of trade practices law which should be mentioned is that conduct which results in mere confusion, or consumers being "caused to wonder", does not amount to misleading and deceptive conduct within the meaning of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The position is to be distinguished from that in trade mark law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">In Parkdale Custom Built Furniture v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198 Gibbs CJ said:
 In McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd v McDonalds System of Australia Pty Ltd (1980) 49 FLR 455 it was rightly held by Smithers J and by Fisher J that to prove a breach of s 52 it is not enough to establish that the conduct complained of was confusing or caused people to wonder whether two products may have come from the same source, and that Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 , a decision on the Trade Marks Act 1905 (Cth), as amended, is distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">I need not add to what their Honours said on this subject (1980) 49 FLR, at pp 458-459, 475-476.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Likewise in Taco Co (Aust) Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 201 Deane and Fitzgerald JJ said:
 Conduct which produces or contributes to confusion or uncertainty may or may not be misleading or deceptive for the purposes of s 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">In some circumstances, conduct could conceivably be properly categorized as misleading or deceptive for the very reason that it represents that confusion or uncertainty exists where, in truth, there is no proper room for either.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Ordinarily, however, a tendency to cause confusion or uncertainty will not suffice to establish that conduct is of the type described in s 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52.</sentence>
