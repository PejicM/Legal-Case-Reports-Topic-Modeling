 This is an appeal from an order of a Federal Magistrates Court made on 26 June 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 21 March 2006 and handed down on 11 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (the first respondent as he was then known) to refuse to grant Protection (Class XA) visas to the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellants are husband, wife and daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant husband (the first appellant) was born on 1 March 1961 and is a citizen of South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant wife (the second appellant) was born on 10 May 1962 and is a citizen of South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant daughter (the third appellant) was born on 1 October 1989 and is also a citizen of South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The first and second appellants have a son who was born on 14 October 1984 and, although he is a citizen of South Africa, he is an Australian Permanent Resident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The first appellant arrived in Australia on 15 October 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The second and third appellants both arrived in Australia on 12 September 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellants lodged applications for protection visas on 7 November 1996 (the first protection visa applications).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">These applications were refused by the delegate on 15 May 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 20 October 2005 the appellants lodged applications for protection visas with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">All of the appellants made claims under the Refugees Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On 9 January 2006 a delegate of the first respondent refused the applications for protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 31 January 2006 the appellants applied to the Tribunal for a review of those decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Tribunal found that the first protection visa applications lacked critical information relating to the reasons why the appellants claimed to be refugees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Tribunal was satisfied that the application forms lodged in 1996 did not substantially comply with statutory requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Tribunal accordingly found that the first protection visa applications were not valid and that the later application, lodged on 20 October 2005, was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It found therefore that the appellants were not barred from lodging the later application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 Background 
 
 The first appellant claimed that he feared persecution based on his ethnicity and political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The first appellant claimed that in 1994 he had become involved with the Minority Front (MF) in South Africa, a group which represented Indians in Parliament, and became interested in the party's election campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The first appellant claimed he attended a meeting of the African National Congress (ANC) when asked to do so by the MF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He stated that he spoke up at the meeting in support of South Africans of Indian descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The first appellant claimed that "one black approached [him] and told [him] to leave for [his] own safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">" The first appellant stated he began to work for the MF, including distributing pamphlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The first appellant claimed that he was attacked one day while distributing pamphlets and, out of fear, relinquished his duties with the MF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">However, despite no longer being involved with the MF, the first appellant claimed that in December 1995 he was approached by a group of four black men, one of whom stated that he remembered him from the ANC political meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">One also stated to him "that if [he] was to live, [he had] to pay for [his] life and [he] had to pay straight away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">" The first appellant handed over his wallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He reported the incident to police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The first appellant claimed that some time later a group of men attended the family home, threatened him and ordered him not to report them to the police again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The first appellant again was forced to give them money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He did not report this incident to the police as he knew he "was being watched and targeted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">" He claimed he was approached on further occasions and payment was demanded from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The first appellant claimed that in May 1996 his home was robbed and his son was held at gunpoint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Later he received anonymous phone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He reported both these incidents to the police but was told that they were unable to act as they were understaffed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Consequently, he said the second appellant left her job; they removed their children from school; and made arrangements to leave South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The second appellant claimed that Indians in South Africa were mistreated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The second appellant made claims about three particular incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">First, in May 1996 she was robbed whilst at a bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">This incident was reported to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Secondly, a few weeks later, whilst driving a car, she was followed and the car following her attempted to drive her off the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">She was convinced at that stage that she was being targeted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Thirdly, the second appellant stated that her home was robbed in August 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The second appellant also stated that returning to South Africa would not be in the best interests of particularly herself and her young daughter because "[b]eing females it [was] extremely dangerous in view of the high incidence of kidnap and rape and in most incidents murder in South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" The third appellant claimed that she feared she would be raped in South Africa because of her Indian origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 The Tribunal's Decision 
 
 The three appellants attended a hearing on 3 March 2006 and all gave oral evidence to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Two witnesses supporting the appellants also gave oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal expressed concerns about the veracity of the appellants' claims but elected to give them the benefit of the doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Although the Tribunal accepted that the first appellant was a member of the MF, it did not accept that he had an organising role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal found it difficult to accept that the appellants had been targeted due to the first appellant's political activities or at all, given the extent of his activities and the cessation of his participation in the MF after the alleged incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Tribunal found the first appellant's evidence of several of the incidents to be confused and found that there was no evidence that the South African authorities had tolerated or condoned the alleged persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Tribunal outlined that even if it did accept as plausible that the family were threatened, the police acted appropriately by taking the August 1996 incident seriously and doing whatever they could in relation to various other incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Tribunal said that if it it were to accept that there were further incidents of harm, looking at the evidence as a whole, it was satisfied that the incidents were essentially and significantly related to the generalised violence and civil disturbances that prevailed in South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the first appellant's involvement in MF or the Indian ethnicity of the family were the essential and significant reasons for any harm suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Tribunal noted that persecution by private individuals or groups did not bring a person within the Convention unless the State either encouraged it or appeared to be powerless to prevent that private persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Tribunal accepted as being plausible that the family had experienced incidents that would amount to serious harm, albeit by non-State agents but for which they received appropriate State assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Tribunal then considered whether there was a real chance of Convention-related harm occurring to the appellants in the reasonable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Tribunal addressed both the second and third appellants' claims to fear rape but found that the claims were speculative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Whilst accepting the second and third appellants were of Indian ethnicity and that the third appellant was a "beautiful young lady" as asserted in her protection visa application, and accepting independent country information that rape remained a serious problem, the Tribunal was satisfied the claims were "speculative".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Tribunal was not satisfied that, without more, there was a real chance that the second and third appellants would be raped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The Tribunal noted that the first appellant had not continued his activities with MF and was satisfied that he would be able to continue his involvement in MF if he so chose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Tribunal considered independent country information and while it was clear that there were racial tensions involving the Indian community and discrimination, the Tribunal was satisfied that there was no systematic ill-treatment of Indians by "black" South Africans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Tribunal acknowledged that if the family were to return to South Africa they may experience difficulties in finding employment, accommodation and resettling generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">While the Tribunal said that it felt for the circumstances of the family, the Tribunal was not satisfied that any difficulties which may be faced by the family would constitute persecution as contemplated by the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 Application in the Federal Magistrates Court 
 
 On 8 May 2006 the appellants sought judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal by filing an application in the Federal Magistrates Court that raised three particularised grounds of review: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Tribunal constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction when finding as "speculative" the claim of applicants 2 and 3 to fear being raped in South Africa in circumstances where the Tribunal was required to consider whether the applicants claim was genuine and well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Tribunal's finding on effective state protection is vitiated by jurisdictional error in circumstances where the evidence accepted by the Tribunal was that the police were powerless in preventing private persecution and/or sexual violence against women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not dealing with an integer of the applicant husband's claim and/or making findings of fact that were not open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In addressing ground 1, the Federal Magistrate stated that the appellant's first complaint was that by the use of the word "speculative", the Tribunal made no finding as to whether the fear of persecution was well-founded or genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Tribunal's use of the word "speculative", on a plain reading and in its context, did not reveal error on the Tribunal's part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The words preceding the use of this term revealed that the Tribunal was seized of the need to address the question of whether the fear of persecution was well-founded or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">His Honour decided that describing the appellant's claims as "speculative" was distinct from engaging in a process of speculation itself in answering that question and, for this reason, there was no jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The use of the word "speculative" to describe the claims did not reveal that the Tribunal employed a lesser or different test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Nor did it reveal any analytical or logical flaw in its reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It took into account all relevant evidence and claims before it and, based on this, found that it could not reach the level of satisfaction that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution as contemplated by the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In relation to the appellants' second ground relating to effective State protection, his Honour found that there was nothing in the evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that the police were powerless to prevent harm to the appellants in all the circumstances relevant to them or that the Tribunal ignored such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The appellants' third ground was that the Tribunal failed to deal with an integer of the first appellant's claim or, in the alternative, made a finding which was not open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The first appellant was attacked and robbed by a group of "black men".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">However, the Tribunal towards the end of its reasons referred to "a black man" instead of "a group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The appellants also argued that this error also affected the Tribunal's subsequent finding that it had doubts about the veracity of the appellants' claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had made a factual error in regard to inexplicably translating a group of men into the singular and in its finding that the appellant was distributing pamphlets as part of a group on that occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Whilst these errors could not be simply explained away as "inelegant presentations", the issue was whether these mistakes could amount to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In Abebe v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 , the Tribunal made a wrong finding of fact on its own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">His Honour found that in this case the Tribunal's mistaken finding did not lead to a failure in the exercise of its jurisdiction, relying on Abebe v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 32 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Ultimately, the Tribunal accepted that the appellant had been assaulted and robbed, and whether the appellant was on his own or a part of a group, or whether the assailant was one or part of a group, did not affect what the Tribunal accepted, which was that the appellant had been assaulted and robbed whilst distributing pamphlets on behalf of the MF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Furthermore, the Tribunal accepted that the appellant had reported the incident to police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also refused to accept that the errors were part of the Tribunal's adverse credibility findings in relation to the appellants in total.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">No jurisdictional error was found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 Appeal to this Court 
 
 The appellants' notice of appeal raised three grounds of appeal with particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">However, the appellant has expressly abandoned ground 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The remaining two grounds are: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">His Honour committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal from the decision of the Second Respondent in circumstances where his Honour construed the reasons for the Second Respondent beneficially, notwithstanding the use by the Tribunal of an inappropriate and ambiguous term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Particulars
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The Second Respondent found that the appellants' claim of fear of rape was "speculative" notwithstanding that evidence was accepted by it that indicated that "rape remains a serious problem in South Africa".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">(b) The "speculative" finding made by the Tribunal was vital to the appellants' claim of fear of persecution by reason of rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">(c) [The Federal Magistrate] agreed that the term "speculative" on its own could give rise to ambiguities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">His Honour also erred in upholding the Second Respondent's decision in circumstances where the Second Respondent committed jurisdictional error in making findings about effective state protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Particulars
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The Tribunal referred to an incident experienced by the appellants in which the police "acted appropriately" and took the matter "very seriously (of August 1996)" and that the police " couldn't have done much any way ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">(b) However, the Tribunal failed to make a finding about whether or not the authorities are powerless to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">(c) Again, [the Federal Magistrate] expressed "sympathy" with the appellants' submissions and noted that the Tribunal's findings could have been "expressed in a clearer fashion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 
 The Tribunal's reasons must be read fairly and in their context: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271, 291.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Tribunal's use of the word "speculative" was not intended, on a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision, to erect a test for a claim for a well-founded fear of persecution other than that contained in the Refugees Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Tribunal said that the fundamental question for it "is whether there is a real chance of Convention-related harm occurring to the applicants in the reasonably (sic) future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">" It then addressed the second and third appellants' fear of being raped in South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is clear that the Tribunal posed for itself the appropriate test, notwithstanding that the Tribunal answered it by saying that the claim was speculative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">That is made even clearer by what the Tribunal said after making that finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It said, "... the Tribunal is not satisfied that those factors, without more, mean that there is a real chance that they would be raped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">" Both before and after the use of the word "speculative" the Tribunal identified for itself the correct test for a well-founded fear of persecution: Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 429.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I agree with the Federal Magistrate that the Tribunal's reasons, considered as a whole, show that the Tribunal posed for itself the correct test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The second ground of appeal, even if successful, would not mean that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The question of State protection did not arise in this case because the Tribunal found that the appellants' fear of persecution was not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">That being the case, the question of State protection did not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Even if it did, however, in my opinion, the ground has not been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Whilst the Tribunal found that rape remained a serious problem in South Africa, the Tribunal raised with the appellants the proposition that they would be able to receive protection from the authorities if they were to return to South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In the end result, it is not entirely clear whether the Tribunal made a decision of that kind but, in my opinion, they were not bound to do so having regard to the conclusion that the appellants' fear of persecution was not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Insofar as the Tribunal considered the question of State protection, no error has been demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">That disposes of the two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Other matters were referred to in the appellants' written and oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In those submissions, the appellants contended that the Tribunal should have found that the second and third appellants' claims of fear of rape were well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The Tribunal found that rape was a serious problem in South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">However, the ultimate finding as to whether or not the second and third appellants' fears were well-founded was a matter for the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">This Court is not entitled to embark upon a merits review: Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In the appellants' written submissions, the appellants suggested that the Tribunal failed to assess the second and third appellants as members of a particular social group in considering their claims of fear of rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The Tribunal did assess their claims on the footing that they were females and beautiful young Indian women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">No other particular social group was propounded by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In that regard, the Tribunal assessed their claims appropriately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In any event, the Tribunal found that their claims of fear of rape were not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">During the hearing, the appellants' counsel contended that the Tribunal had fallen into error by saying that it was "no systematic ill-treatment of Indians by 'black' South Africans".</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">It was put to counsel that the appellants' notice of appeal did not make such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Nor did the appellants' application to the Federal Magistrates Court make such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Court adjourned for a short time to enable the appellants' counsel to consider whether to apply to amend the notice of appeal to include a further ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On resumption, the appellants' counsel said no such application would be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Presumably, in doing so, the appellants had regard to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In any event, for the reasons given, the appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The first and second appellants should pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
