<sentence id="s0">
 On 24 July 2009 I made orders dismissing appeals brought by Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd (in liquidation), Mr Peter Tracy and Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In so far and as the appeals were brought by Citrus Queensland, I did so because the liquidator of the company had indicated it did not wish to participate further in the appeal proceedings and plainly, it did not intend to prosecute the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In so far as the appeals were brought by Mr Tracy and Sunstate Citrus, I did so with their consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I also ordered the appellants to pay the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">This was not opposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The respondents submitted that the costs should be payable on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The solicitor for the second and third appellants resisted this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This judgment deals with that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Much of the relevant history of the litigation between the parties is recounted by Greenwood J in the judgment given on 6 May 2009 ordering the winding up of Citrus Queensland: [2009] FCA 452 at [3] - [10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Other relevant events and the more recent history of significance are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appeals were listed before Spender J as the appeals call-over judge on 13 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">His Honour listed the appeals for hearing on 17 to 20 August 2009 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Court informed the parties on about 26 May 2009 that the settling of the appeal book index was listed to 15 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellants failed to file and serve a draft appeal book index on or before 5 June 2009 as was required by the rules (8 June being a public holiday).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">At the request of the appellants on about 12 June 2009, the Court gave the appellants 14 days to determine whether the appeals were to proceed and, accordingly, the Court adjourned the settling of the appeal books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 9 July 2009 the Court notified the parties that the index would be settled on 20 July 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">No draft index was filed and served by any of the appellants and the first appellant did not attend the hearing to settle it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 21 July 2009, the respondents filed a notice of motion seeking that the appeals be dismissed for want of prosecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was listed for hearing on 24 July 2009 when the orders referred to earlier dismissing the appeals were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The gravamen of the argument of the respondents was that the appellants had not prosecuted the appeals, they had been put on notice that it would be necessary for the respondents to prepare for the hearing of the appeals and their conduct was, in all the circumstances, so unreasonable as to warrant an order for indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Reference was made to Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 , Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [23] and Khera v Jones [2008] FCA 548 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The solicitor appearing for the second and third appellants submitted that the circumstances have to be viewed through the prism created by the liquidation of the first appellant on the application of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is true that the appellants have not prosecuted the appeals with alacrity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In relation to the first appellant, that is understandable because the appointment of a liquidator alters, obviously enough, the circumstances in which and the basis on which the company then might continue to prosecute litigation in which it was involved at the time it was wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Almost invariably that will complicate and often delay the prosecution of such litigation even if it proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In a case such as the present where the direct primary beneficiary of any successful appeal was likely to be the first appellant, the winding up of the company had an impact on the participation in the litigation of other parties whose interests are allied to impose of the company in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">While it is regrettable that the liquidator was not able to make a decision about prosecution of the appeal until 23 July 2009, I do not view the conduct of the first appellant and the consequential or at least allied indecision on the part of the second and third appellant as evidencing conduct which would warrant costs being ordered on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I refuse to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice MOORE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Associate:
