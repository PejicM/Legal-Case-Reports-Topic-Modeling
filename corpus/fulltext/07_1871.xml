 Introduction 
 
1 Viva Erotica is a film which contains real depictions of actual sexual activity between consenting adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It contains no violence, sexual violence, coercion or sexual fetishes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Classification Review Board, established under a co-operative legislative scheme providing for uniform classification of films throughout Australia, determined that the film is offensive to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It classified the film as X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 Adultshop.Com Limited, which submitted the film for classification, contended that the Review Board should classify the film as R18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Both the X18+ and the R18+ classifications are restricted to persons 18 years and above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The practical effect of the higher X18+ classification is that it is not legally available for sale or hire in Australia, other than in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Adultshop seeks review of the decision of the Review Board under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It raises a number of questions of statutory construction of the legislative scheme under which the classification is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It also relies upon various grounds of review of administrative action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The uniform classification scheme was established under an agreement made in 1995 between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">An integral part of the scheme is the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The scheme incorporates a code which describes the different classification categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This is known as the National Classification Code ("the Code").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 The Code contains a table of classifications which I will set out in more detail later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the X18+ classification applies to films that contain real depictions of actual sexual activity between consenting adults "in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">"
 
6 The legislative scheme also includes Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games 2005 ("The Guidelines").</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Guidelines were made under s 12 of the Act which empowers the Minister, (that is, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth), with the agreement of participating State and Territory Ministers, to determine guidelines to assist the decision-maker in applying the criteria set out in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 The Guidelines state that the X18+ classification applies to films that contain real depictions of actual sexual intercourse but they do not include the words in the Code which refer to the likelihood of offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Guidelines recognise that the R18+ classification may contain depictions of realistically simulated sexual activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">But they go on to say:
 
 "The general rule is 'simulation, yes --- the real thing, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">'" 
 

8 Adultshop contends that these two aspects of the Guidelines led the Review Board into error by determining the classification of the film without considering whether it met the criterion for the X18+ classification in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That is to say, Adultshop contends that the Review Board failed to consider whether the film was likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 Adultshop raised a number of grounds of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">First, it contended that the Guidelines are beyond the power of the Minister under s 12 of the Act because they dictate an X18+ classification without regard to s 11(a) of the Act or the provisions of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 Second, Adultshop contended that if the Guidelines are valid, the Review Board applied them without regard to the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">This ground embraces a number of separate heads of review, namely inflexible application of policy, failure to take into account relevant considerations under the Act and the Code and Wednesbury unreasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 Third, Adultshop contended that the Review Board failed to give effect to a proper construction of the phrase "likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Adultshop argued that this test was to be determined by asking whether a majority of Australian adults consider sexually explicit films to be offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">12 Fourth, Adultshop contended that the Review Board's approach to the task led it to wrongly reject or discount certain survey and expert evidence called by Adultshop in support of its claim for an R18+ classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 Fifth, Adultshop pointed to a finding made by the Review Board that there was extensive community consultation in the process of updating the Guidelines in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Adultshop contended that the 2005 review of the Guidelines did not consider the X18+ classification and there was no community consultation on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Accordingly, Adultshop sought to raise a "no evidence" ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The legislative scheme 
 
14 The legislative scheme was described by Merkel J at first instance in Brown v Classification Review Board (1997) 145 ALR 464 at 466-468, and, on appeal from that decision, in Brown v Classification Review Board (1998) 82 FCR 225 at 231-233 (per French J), and at 252-254 (per Sundberg J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">See also New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Classification Review Board (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">2) [2007] FCA 896 at [4] - [8] (per Edmonds J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">15 The present scheme replaces an earlier co-operative legislative scheme providing for censorship of films and other publications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The revised scheme was established under an agreement made 28 November 1995 between the Commonwealth, States and Territories ("the Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">16 The Agreement provided for a revised co-operative legislative scheme for censorship in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The effect of the Agreement was to provide for the classification of films, publications and computer games through the provisions of the Act , and to leave the enforcement of the classifications and the legislative consequences of them to the States and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">17 The Agreement provided for the scheme to be administered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It also provided that the Code and the classification guidelines are not to be amended without the agreement of the responsible Ministers of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">18 Section 3 of the Act states that its purpose is to provide for the classification of publications, films and computer games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The section goes on to say that the Act is intended to form part of a Commonwealth / State / Territory scheme for classification of, inter alia , films, and for the enforcement of those classifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">19 The Act provides for the establishment of the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board: ss 45 and 72 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In the appointment of Members to the Board and the Review Board, regard is to be had to the desirability of ensuring that membership is broadly representative of the Australian community: ss 48(2) and 74 (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">20 The Code is defined by s 5 to mean the National Classification Code, set out in the Schedule to the Act as originally enacted, as amended in accordance with s 6 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Section 6(2) provides that if the Minister and each participating Minister agree to an amendment of the Code, it is taken to be amended accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">21 Section 7(2) sets out the different types of classification for films in ascending order of seriousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The classifications are:
 
 G General
 PG Parental Guidance
 M Mature
 MA15+ Mature Accompanied
 R18+ Restricted
 X18+ Restricted
 RC Refused Classification
 

22 Division 2 of the Act deals with the classification of publications, films and computer games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Classifications are to be made by the Board in writing on application: see s 10(1) and s 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">23 Section 9 provides that films are to be classified in accordance with the Code and the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Section 11 sets out matters to be considered in making the classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Those provisions are central to the questions in issue in these proceedings and I will set them out in full (as they were at the time of the Review Board's decision):
 
 "9 Publications, films and computer games are to be classified in accordance with the Code and the classification guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 11 Matters to be considered in classification 
 The matters to be taken into account in making a decision on the classification of a publication, a film or a computer game include: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults; and 
 (b) the literary, artistic, or educational merit (if any) of the publication, film or computer game; and 
 (c) the general character of the publication, film or computer game, including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character; and 
 (d) the persons or class of persons to or amongst whom it is published or is intended or likely to be published.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">" 
 

24 I referred earlier to s 12 which provides for the determination of classification guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Section 12(1) is in the following terms:
 
 "(1) The Minister may, with the agreement of each participating Minister, determine guidelines to assist the Board in applying the criteria in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 
 

25 Section 12(3) provides that if the Minister and each participating Minister agree to an amendment to the Classification Guidelines, they are taken to be amended accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">26 Section 20(1) requires the Board to determine consumer advice giving information about the content of a film where the Board classifies the film PG, M, MA, R18+ or X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">If the Board classifies a film G, it may exercise its discretion to determine consumer advice providing information about the content: s 20(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">27 Part 3 of the Act deals with approval of advertisements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Although no question arises in relation to the advertising of Viva Erotica , counsel for the Attorney-General placed some emphasis on the provisions of s 29(4) which requires the Board to refuse approval for advertising in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I will therefore set out that sub-section in full as follows:
 
 "The Board must refuse to approve an advertisement if, in the opinion of the Board, the advertisement: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) describes, depicts or otherwise deals with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that it offends against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that it should not be approved; or 
 (b) depicts or describes, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 (whether the person is engaged in sexual activity or not); or 
 (c) promotes crime or violence, or incites or instructs in matters of crime or violence; or 
 (d) is used, or is likely to be used, in a way that is offensive to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" 
 

28 Part 5 deals with the review of decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">A person who applies to the Board for classification of a film may apply to the Review Board for a review of the Board's decision: s 42(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">So too may the publisher of the film: s 42(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">29 The Review Board must deal with an application for review of a decision in the same way that the Board deals with the application for classification: s 44(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Review Board is therefore required to classify the film in accordance with the Code and the Guidelines as provided in s 9 and to take into account the matters referred to in s 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">30 Part 6 deals with the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I referred above to the provisions dealing with the establishment of the Board and the broad representation of its membership: s 45 and 
 s 48(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">31 Part 7 deals with the Review Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I referred above to the salient provisions of this Part dealing with establishment and broad representation: s 72 and s 74(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Code 
 
32 The Code states that classification decisions are to give effect, as far as possible, to four principles set out in [1] as follows:
 
 
 "(a) adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want; 
 (b) minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them; 
 (c) everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive; 
 (d) the need to take account of community concerns about: 
 
 
 (i) depictions that condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence; and 
 (ii) the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">" 
 

33 Films are to be classified in accordance with a table set out in [3] of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The table lists the classifications in descending order of gravity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">34 The table is as follows: 
 

 Item Description of film Classification 1 Films that: (a) depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified; or (b) describe or depict in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is, or appears to be , a child under 18 (whether the person is engaged in sexual activity or not); or (c) promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime or violence RC 2 Films (except RC films) that: (a) contain real depictions of actual sexual activity between consenting adults in which there is no violence, sexual violence, sexualised violence, coercion, sexually assaultive language, or fetishes or depictions which purposefully demean anyone involved in that activity for the enjoyment of viewers, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult; and (b) are unsuitable for a minor to see X 18+ 3 Films (except RC films and X 18+ films) that are unsuitable for a minor to see R 18+ 4 Films (except RC films, X 18+ films and R 18+ films) that depict, express or otherwise deal with sex, violence or coarse language in such a manner as to be unsuitable for viewing by persons under 15 MA 15+ 5 Films (except RC films, X 18+ films, R 18+ films and MA 15+ films) that cannot be recommended for viewing by persons who are under 15 M 6 Films (except RC films, X 18+ films, R 18+ films, MA 15+ films and M films) that cannot be recommended for viewing by persons who are under 15 without the guidance of their parents or guardians PG 7 All other films G 

 
 The Guidelines 
 
35 The Introduction to the Guidelines states that they are a tool for classifying films and that they help to explain the different classification categories and the scope and limits of material suitable for classification under each category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The Introduction also states that the Guidelines "are revised from time to time, with extensive community input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">" 
 
36 The Guidelines list three essential principles which underlie their use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">They are:
&#8226; the importance of context
&#8226; assessing impact 
 
&#8226; the six classifiable elements 
 
37 Each of these principles is explained further under the heading "Using the Guidelines: Essential Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">" 
 
38 The Guidelines state that context is crucial in determining whether a classifiable element is justified by the story-line or themes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">39 The Guidelines use a hierarchy, set out in ascending order of seriousness, in assessing the impact of a film.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The hierarchy is:
&#8226; very mild G
&#8226; mild PG
&#8226; moderate M
&#8226; strong MA 15+
&#8226; high R18+
 
&#8226; very high RC 
 
40 Films to be classified X18+ are not included in the "hierarchy of impact" set out in the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">41 Assessing the impact of a film is said to require consideration not only of the individual elements, but also their cumulative effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It also requires consideration of the purpose and tone of a sequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">42 The Guidelines go on to say that the impact of a film may be higher where a scene uses various visual techniques such as close-ups, accentuation techniques or repetition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">43 The six classifiable elements of a film are stated to be:
&#8226; themes
&#8226; violence
&#8226; sex
&#8226; language
&#8226; drug use
&#8226; nudity 
 
44 The Guidelines state that the classification of a film takes into account the context and impact of each of the listed elements, including their frequency and intensity, as well as their cumulative effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">45 It is unnecessary to reproduce the explanations set out in the Guidelines for the G, PG, M, MA15+ and RC categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The explanations given for the R18+ and X18+ categories are as follows:
 R 18+ - RESTRICTED 
 
 Impact test
 
 The impact of material classified R18+ should not exceed high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 Note: This classification category applies only to films.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Material classified R18+ is legally restricted to adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Some material classified R18+ may be offensive to sections of the adult community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 
 Classifiable elements
 
 THEMES
 There are virtually no restrictions on the treatment of themes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">VIOLENCE
 Violence is permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Sexual violence may be implied, if justified by context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">SEX
 Sexual activity may be realistically simulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The general rule is "simulation, yes --- the real thing, no".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">LANGUAGE
 There are virtually no restrictions on language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">DRUG USE
 Drug use is permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">NUDITY
 Nudity is permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">

 
 X18+ - RESTRICTED 
 
 CONTAINS CONSENSUAL SEXUALLY EXPLICIT ACTIVITY (Restricted to adults 18 years and over*) 
 
 * Available only for sale or hire in the ACT and Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 
 
 Note: This classification category applies only to films.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">This classification is a special and legally restricted category which contains only sexually explicit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That is material which contains real depictions of actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity between consenting adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 No depiction of violence, sexual violence, sexualised violence or coercion is allowed in the category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It does not allow sexually assaultive language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Nor does it allow consensual depictions which purposefully demean anyone involved in that activity for the enjoyment of viewers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Fetishes such as body piercing, application of substances such as candle wax, 'golden showers', bondage, spanking or fisting are not permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">As the category is restricted to activity between consenting adults, it does not permit any depictions on non-adult persons, including those aged 16 or 17, nor of adult persons who look like they are under 18 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Nor does it permit persons 18 years of age or over to be portrayed as minors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">


 
46 The explanation under the RC classification states, inter alia , that films which exceed R18+ and X18+ will be refused classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Viva Erotica 
 
47 The Review Board described the film, and made findings of fact as to its content, which are accepted as accurate by the parties to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The description set out below is taken directly from the Review Board's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">48 The film is of 98 minutes duration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It depicts men and women having sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">There is no plot and the participants are not given names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There are six separate, unrelated "vignettes" containing explicit sex scenes, five involving a man and a woman and one involving two women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">49 Various forms of sexual activity are explicitly shown including cunnilingus, fellatio, rear-entry sex, the use of dildos, self, partner and mutual masturbation, ejaculation, digital and penal vaginal penetration and tongue stimulation of the anus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">50 The camera angles are designed to accentuate and focus on the sexual activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Throughout the film there is significant and frequent use of cinematographic techniques to accentuate the sexual activity including close-ups, zooms, lighting, background music and noises by the participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">51 The Review Board did not consider that the film depicted fetishes, although Vignette 1 contains prolonged scenes of toe sucking and licking; Vignette 4 contains four-fingered vaginal penetration and Vignette 6 shows a man using his open hand to stimulate his erect penis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Review Board's Reasons 
 
52 In reviewing Adultshop's application for classification of the film, the panel was comprised of all seven members of the Review Board including the Convenor and the Deputy Convenor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">53 The Review Board observed that s 11(a) of the Act required it to take into account standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It accepted that these are a reflection of community standards which change over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">54 Although the Review Board accepted that, as a matter of principle, survey and expert evidence can be informative and persuasive, it said that:
 
 "... the Review Board cannot simply delegate its responsibility to make a decision on community standards to others --- no matter how learned those others may be or how many people may be involved in a survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" 
 
 

55 Later in its reasons, the Review Board found that the expert and survey evidence did not support Adultshop's argument that reasonable adults were not offended by the film.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It gave detailed reasons for this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">56 The Review Board considered its role to be to apply, independently, its own understanding and perception of community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It referred to the requirements of 
 s 74(2) of the Act that membership of the Review Board be broadly representative of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It said that this selection criterion was:
 
 " ... presumably to enable it to bring to its decision making the perspective of a wide cross section of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">" 
 
 

57 The Review Board stated that community standards among Australian adults are not uniform on the topic of sexually explicit films; there is a wide spectrum of views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Review Board continued:
 
 "From this broad spectrum including older and younger, liberal and conservative, passionate and ambivalent views, the Review Board must use its own perception, its experience and available evidence to form the best view in the circumstances of the current standards of the Australian community and reasonable adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">" (Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 

58 In reaching its conclusion, the Review Board stated that it had regard to its perception of community standards "as demonstrated by the process of updating the Guidelines in May 2005".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It said it also had regard to the debate over the amendments to the X classification at the turn of the decade and that both the updating and the debate, 
 
 "... involved extensive community consultation and a conclusion, by State, Territory and Australian Governments that the classification regime in relation to R and X rated films did not require an overhaul in light of changing community standards and that the current classifications were, broadly, working well and were in line with community expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">" 
 
 

59 The Review Board regarded the general rule stated in the Guidelines for R18+ "simulation yes --- the real thing, no" as broadly representative of current community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It considered that most reasonable adults would accept an exception to the general rule, permitting an R18+ classification for explicit sexual activity, where the film has artistic, or other merit, and the actual sex is not prolonged or detailed, having regard to the context of the film.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">60 The Review Board continued:
 
 "However, it is the view of the Review Board that in regard to a wholly explicit film, such as Viva Erotica, where the entire film is focused solely on sexually explicit activity and titillation that the community would not accept this under the 'exception' rule and that the general rule should therefore apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Review Board noted that the Applicant made no submission as to artistic or any other merit of Viva Erotica.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">" 
 
 

61 A factor which the Review Board took into account was that if it were to classify films such as Viva Erotica as R18+ there would be little more left for the X18+ classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It was the Review Board's view that it should not lightly make a decision that would radically alter a regime endorsed by the governments of the Commonwealth, States and Territories without persuasive evidence that such a decision was justified by changed community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">62 I do not propose to repeat the reasons given by the Review Board for finding that the expert and survey evidence was unhelpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It is sufficient to say that the Review Board observed that the survey participants were not shown Viva Erotica or a similar film.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Also, the Review Board did not consider that the evidence of the experts, Professor Lumby, Professor McKee and Ms Albury, addressed the specific question of whether a reasonable adult would be offended by the explicit content of Viva Erotica .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">63 That is not to say that the Review Board paid no regard to that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It said:
 
 "Overall, the Review Board noted and took into account all the expert evidence in its consideration of current community standards and of whether Viva Erotica contained depictions that would offend a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The Review Board did not regard the evidence as definitive on either issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The evidence was quite general in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">" 

64 The Review Board also considered the general character of the film which it said was "solely to titillate" the audience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It described the film as pornographic with all the attendant directorial and "filmic devices".</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Review Board considered that the character of the film pointed against a departure from the general rule that "the real thing" is not to be classified as R18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">65 The likely audience of the film, which the Review Board took into account, was persons in search of titillation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It noted that the effect of restrictions contained in State legislation would have the effect that the audience would be more limited if the film were classified X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">It continued by saying:
 
 "However, it is not the Review Board's task to second guess decisions of elected Governments or to ensure that a film has the widest possible audience when determining its classification.</sentence>

66 The Review Board took into account the four principles to which it is required to give effect under the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It emphasised the words in the Code "as far as possible" and noted that the principles are not absolute binding rules but really statements of principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">67 The Review Board concluded that, taking into account all the matters mentioned in its reasons, the film Viva Erotica would cause offence to a reasonable adult "(either as that term is defined in the Guidelines or as defined in the Macquarie Dictionary)" and that it was unsuitable for a minor to see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It found that there were no circumstances justifying a departure from the general rule in the Guidelines, that is, that "the real thing" should not be classified R18+, and that the most appropriate classification was X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">68 The conclusion which the Review Board reached was a unanimous one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">It decided that the X18+ classification should be accompanied with the consumer advice of "Explicit sex".</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The Expert Evidence 
 
69 Ordinarily, the acceptance or rejection of expert evidence, or the use made of it by a decision-maker, will be a question of fact which is not open to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">70 However, here, Adultshop contended that the Review Board's approach to the evidence of the three experts, and the survey evidence, raised grounds of review, including failure to consider the merits of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">I will therefore refer briefly to the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">71 Ms Catherine Lumby is an Associate Professor of Media and Communications at the University of Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">She has written extensively in the field of censorship and sexually explicit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">She has also conducted a substantial amount of research in this area, and was a "Co-Investigator" of a project entitled Understanding Pornography in Australia which was funded by the Australian Research Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">72 Professor Lumby's evidence was that:
 
 "The evidence is overwhelming that, having regard to community standards of morality, decency and propriety, the majority of Australian adults are not offended by films that primarily involve various forms of actual sexual activity, including close-ups, between consenting adults and in which there is no depiction of coercion or violence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 
 

73 Professor Lumby supported her opinion by reference to three studies conducted in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The first was a 1992 survey conducted by the Office of Film and Literature Classification; the second was a 1999 survey carried out by Roy Morgan Research; the third was a 2006 survey conducted by AC Nielsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">74 She also referred to other research studies conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom .</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">
 
75 Ms Katherine Albury is a Lecturer in Gender and Cultural Studies at the University of Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">She is also an Honorary Research Associate in Media and Communications at that University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">She has written, and carried out research in the area of contemporary community attitudes to sexually explicit media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">She has also worked, and carried out research in the field of sexual health and sexual ethics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">76 Ms Albury was also a "Co-Chief Investigator" on the project Understanding Pornography in Australia .</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">77 Ms Albury's conclusions were as follows:
 
 &#8226; "the reasonable adult" is not offended by sexually explicit films depicting various forms of sexual activity, including close-ups, between consulting adults, provided there is no coercion or violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">&#8226; This conclusion is supported by research conducted in Australia since 1992 which indicates that between 56% and 75% of those surveyed believe that non violent, sexually explicit materials depicting consenting adults should be available to adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">&#8226; It is also supported by research which indicates that most Australians have a "liberal" attitude towards sexually explicit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">&#8226; Nevertheless, attitudes vary widely according to political, religious "or other affiliations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">"

<sentence id="s183">He was a Co-Chief Investigator on the research project Understanding Pornography in Australia with Professor Lumby and Ms Albury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">79 The question which Professor McKee was asked was whether, having regard to current community standards, a film primarily involving various forms of actual sexual activity, including close-ups, between consenting adults, but with no coercion or violence, would be likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">80 Professor McKee answered this question upon the basis of a conclusion reached by him that consumers of sexually explicit material can fairly be described as "reasonable adults".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He concluded, by reference to an extensive review of available literature and a "large-scale" survey of consumers of sexually explicit materials, that such a film would be unlikely to cause offence "to this sizeable group of reasonable adults in the Australian population.</sentence>

 Whether the Guidelines are invalid 
 
81 Adultshop contends that the effect of the Guidelines is that films containing real depictions of actual sexual activity between consenting adults are to be classified X18+ regardless of the offensiveness criterion stated in the Code; that is to say, without regard to the requirement that the depiction of the activity is to be likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">82 The relief sought by Adultshop, if these contentions are correct, relates to a legislative instrument made by the participating Ministers pursuant to the Agreement and the provisions of s 12(3) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Notice of the proceedings has been given to the relevant State and Territory Ministers but they have not sought to be joined as parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">I do not consider that their absence renders the proceedings incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">83 In my opinion, Adultshop's contentions as to the effect of the Guidelines are unsustainable because they are contrary to the plain meaning and effect of the legislative scheme considered as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">84 Section 7(2) of the Act sets out the different types of classification to be given to films.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">But the Act does not contain any detailed description of the types of films which fall within each of those classifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The only description of the classification in the Act is found in s 7(2) in the words following each acronym.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Relevantly, both R18+ and X18+ are described as "Restricted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">85 Although s 11 lists four matters which the Review Board must take into account, it gives no guidance as to how the criteria are to be applied to the particular classifications stated in s 7(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">All that can be gleaned from s 11 is that each of the four listed factors must be taken into account in making a classification, whether it be PG, X18+ or any of the other classifications listed in s 7(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">86 The matters which the Review Board must take into account in accordance with s 11 are not limited to the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">They include the film's artistic or educational merit (if any), its general character and likely viewing audience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">87 Section 11 does not spell out the weight to be given by the Review Board to each of the four matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">All four factors must be taken into account by the Review Board in making classifications of the very wide range of films which come before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Plainly enough, the Review Board would need to consider more carefully the generally-accepted standards of morality and decency in its classification of Viva Erotica than it would in classifying The Sound of Music .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">88 The pivotal section of the Act , for present purposes, is s 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">That section requires the Review Board to classify films in accordance with the Code and the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">This is a mandatory requirement: see the Explanatory Memorandum to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994 at [25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">89 The gap in s 7 with respect to the description of the types of films that are covered by the specified classifications is covered by the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">That is to say, as is pointed out in the Guidelines, the Act names the classification categories and the Code describes them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">90 The table which I set out at [34] describes the film classifications in descending order of gravity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">It commences with RC and works its way down to G. Each category, other than RC, excludes the operation of the more serious classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">A film which is classified RC cannot be classified as X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">An X18+ film cannot be classified R18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">91 In this way, the Review Board would be required to work its way down from the RC classification to arrive at the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In some instances the move down the classification table would be a very quick process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">In others, difficult questions may arise as to whether the more serious classification is to be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">92 The Code also contains four statements of principle to which the decisions of the Review Board are to give effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">However, as the Review Board observed at [7.4.12], it is required to give effect to them only " as far as possible ...they are not absolute binding rules but merely statements of principle": see also NSW Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Classification Review Board (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">2) at [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">93 Having set out the classifications in the Act and described them in the Code, the Guidelines go on to explain the scope and limits of each classification category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">They identify criteria which may meet particular classifications, but they are not inconsistent with the matters which the Review Board must take into account under s 11 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">94 The Guidelines are to be read with the Act and the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">They do not replace those instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">They merely spell out in more detail how classification decisions may generally be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">They do not dictate the particular classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">To the contrary, they emphasise the importance of looking at each film on its own merits, having regard to the three essential guiding principles namely the context, the impact and the classifiable elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">95 All of these principles require the exercise of judgment of the way in which those matters appear in each film submitted for classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Context requires consideration of the story-line and theme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Impact requires assessment of the treatment of the classifiable elements (including sex, language and nudity) as well as consideration of the purpose and tone of the film sequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It also requires consideration of the cinematographic devices such as close-ups and frequency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">96 The weight to be given to each of these matters is left to the Review Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Membership of the Review Board is intended to be broadly representative of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It is for the Review Board to determine, in the exercise of its judgment, what weight is to be given to the various factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">97 The principles stated in the Guidelines may be seen as explaining and supplementing the matters specified in s 11 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">They are not inconsistent with the requirement of s 11 that each of those matters be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">To the extent that they supplement those matters, there is no inconsistency with the requirements of s 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">That section does not contain an exhaustive list of factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">It does not prevent the Review Board from having regard to other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">All that is required is that the Review Board include in the factors which it takes into account, the four matters stated in s 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">98 Nor does the explanation of each of the classification categories contained in the Guidelines conflict with the Act or the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">99 The explanations of the R18+ and X18+ classifications, which I have set out at [45], make it plain that there are two categories of classifications which cover films with high sexual content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Both are restricted to adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">100 Whilst the explanations in the Guidelines seek to distinguish such films by excluding "the real thing" from an R18+ classification and leaving it to the X18+ category (provided it satisfies the other elements), they do not dictate that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It remains for the Review Board to decide whether, in its judgment, the general rule is an accurate reflection of what is "likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">" I will return to this issue later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">101 Furthermore, it is quite wrong to read the general rule "simulation, yes --- the real thing no" as anything other than it is stated to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Plainly, the general rule admits of exceptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The Guidelines must be read as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Regard must be had to context and impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The Review Board must have regard to, amongst other things, the artistic merit and general character of the film: see s 11 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">These matters are not displaced by the general rule contained in the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">102 That the "real thing" guideline admits of exceptions is exemplified by the approach which the Review Board has taken to other films which apparently contain depictions of actual sexual activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The Review Board referred to the exception for films with artistic or other merit in its reasons and it gave examples of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">103 Thus, when read together, the Act , the Code and the Guidelines lay down a harmonious scheme for the classification of films and other subject matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This is precisely what was contemplated by the Agreement made in 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The Agreement provided for the scheme to be administered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In their present form, the Code and the Guidelines were made with the agreement of SCAG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">104 It was open to the SCAG to indicate in the Guidelines that, as a general rule, depictions of actual sexual activity would meet the test for films likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whether in any particular case it does cause such offence is a matter of judgment for the Review Board in accordance with the Act , the Code and the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">105 The Guidelines do the very work which they are required to do by s 12(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">They assist the Review Board in applying the criteria in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The submission that they go beyond this task is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Whether the Review Board applied the Guidelines without proper regard to the merits of the case 
 
106 Adultshop submitted that even if the Guidelines are valid, the Review Board applied them inflexibly without having regard to the merits of its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">107 Underlying this contention is Adultshop's submission that the Review Board failed to take into account the community standards factor stated in s 11(a) of the Act and that it failed to use the Guidelines to assist it in applying the criteria stated in the Code: s 12(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">108 Adultshop submitted that, instead, the Review Board failed, in particular, to properly consider the application of the X18+ classification described in the Code, under which the depiction of sexual activity must be likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Adultshop submitted that the Review Board applied the Guidelines, that is to say, "the real thing" guideline and the description of the X18+ category which I have set out at [45] above, as if they were determinative of the classification decision, without regard to the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">109 Adultshop also submitted that once the Review Board determined to approach the matter on the basis that the Guidelines accurately reflect current community standards for the X18+ classification, any evidence called by Adultshop could not be accepted by the Review Board regardless of the merit of such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">110 There is ample authority for the proposition that inflexible application of a policy, even if the policy is consistent with the statute under which the power is conferred, gives rise to reviewable error: see eg NEAT Domestic Trading Pty Limited v AWB Limited [2003] HCA 35 ; (2003) 216 CLR 277 at [24] per Gleeson CJ; Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">2) (1979) 2 ALD 364 at 640-641 per Brennan J; Elias v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 845 ; 123 FCR 499 at [34] per Hely J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Further authority for this proposition may be found in Khan v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1987) 14 ALD 291; Oreb v Willcock [2004] FCA 1520 at [172] ; and Le v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 51 at [100] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">111 However, in my opinion, it is clear from the reasons given by the Review Board that it did not arrive at its decision by an unthinking application of policy regardless of the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Rather, the Review Board's reasons reveal that it paid careful attention to the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">112 There are six critical aspects of the Review Board's reasons which support this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">113 First, the Review Board said that it had regard to Adultshop's written and oral submissions including its survey and expert evidence and supporting material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The Review Board's discussion of the submissions and its consideration of the survey and expert evidence make it plain that the Review Board carefully considered all of this material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">114 Second, the Review Board said that it was required to use "its own perception, its experience and available evidence" to form the best view of current community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In light of this, it cannot be suggested that it failed to give proper consideration to the merits of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">115 Third, the Review Board acknowledged that community standards can and do change and that survey and expert evidence can be informative and persuasive in considering this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Moreover, the Review Board noted and took into account all of that evidence, although ultimately it came to the view that the evidence was not "definitive" on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">116 Fourth, the Review Board indicated that it may be prepared to make a decision that had the effect of altering a regime which had the endorsement of Australia-wide governments if there was "persuasive evidence" of changed community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">However, the Board was not persuaded that such evidence existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">117 Fifth, it gave consideration to whether the overall character and impact of the film justified a departure from the general rule that actual sexual activity is to be classified as X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It said that where the entire film is focused solely upon actual sexual activity, the film did not fall within the exception for artistic or other merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">It noted that Adultshop did not make any submission that the film had such merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">118 Sixth, the Review Board considered all of the expert and survey evidence provided by Adultshop but came to the view that it did not lend "significant support" to the contention that reasonable adults would not be offended by the film's content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">It gave detailed reasons for this finding, all of which were open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">119 It is plain from the reasons given by the Review Board that it considered the case advanced by Adultshop and rejected it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">120 Adultshop made lengthy complaints about the Review Board's treatment of its evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">However, this merely serves to emphasise that the Review Board did give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Indeed, what Adultshop seeks on this application is merits review which is not the function of an application for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">121 It is true that the description of the X18+ classification set out in the Guidelines, and reproduced at [45] above, may be seen as applying in its entirety to the content of Viva Erotica .</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">It is also true that the description makes no reference to the requirement of the Code that the depictions of sexual activity would be likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">122 However, it is plain that the Review Board did not simply apply this description as determinative of the classification of the film.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It treated the description of the X18+ classification in the Guidelines as indicative of community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It also regarded the general rule "simulation yes --- the real thing, no" as broadly representative of current standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">But its observations about the relevance of artistic and other merit show that it did not treat the Guidelines as an exclusive or determinative test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">123 Instead, the Review Board made its own finding as to current community standards based upon its perceptions, experience and available evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">124 It is true that the Review Board considered that if Viva Erotica were to be classified R18+ rather than X18+, the X classification would have little work to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">But this does not indicate any failure to have regard to the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Rather, it reflects the Review Board's view of the proper construction of the Code; indeed it is one with which I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I will deal with this issue below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">"Likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult" 
 
125 A central plank in Adultshop's attack upon the Review Board's decision was the proposition that the phrase 'likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult' imports a test of whether a majority of Australians would be likely to be offended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">126 Senior Counsel for Adultshop called in aid the remarks of Wheeler JA in Hutchins v The State of Western Australia [2006] WASCA 258 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Her Honour there observed that the broad social purposes of censorship include ensuring that ordinary members of the community are not affronted by the display of material to which a majority of reasonable adults would object.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">127 It is of course well established that the general purpose and policy of a statutory provision are a guide to its proper construction: see Australian Broadcasting Authority v Project Blue Sky [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69] --- [71]; see also CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited [1997] HCA 2 ; (1995) 187 CLR 384 at 408.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Ordinarily, the purpose will be gleaned from the legislative history and other extrinsic material as well as from the provisions of the statute considered as a whole: Newcastle City Council v GIO General Limited [1997] HCA 53 ; (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 112-113 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Regard may be paid to an object clause but it is to be read in light of the overall statutory regime: IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1 at 12 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">128 Wheeler JA's observations in Hutchins were not based upon a consideration of the extensive material or the statute as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Nor was her Honour considering the cooperative legislative scheme which is the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Rather, her Honour's remarks were directed at the broad social purpose of this type of legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">A statement of legislative purpose at this level of generality cannot displace the construction of the statute which emerges from an analysis of the language of the provision in its full context: Victims Compensation Fund v Brown [2002] NSWCA 155 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 668 at [9] --- [10] per Spigelman CJ; his Honour's dissenting judgment was approved by the High Court in Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Brown [2003] HCA 54 ; (2003) 201 ALR 260.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">129 It follows in my view that the observations of Wheeler JA in Hutchins are not authority for the proposition that the words "likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult" imports a test of whether a majority of Australians would be likely to be offended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Moreover, if her Honour intended to say that the test is one of ascertaining the views of a simple majority, that is, 51% of the population, I respectfully disagree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The legislative history, overseas and Australian authority as well as the construction of the phrase in its statutory context all point against that construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The legislative history 
 
130 The genesis of the co-operative legislative scheme for censorship of films and other publications is to be found in the Australian Law Reform Commission Report No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">55, Censorship Procedure .</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The ALRC Report was produced following upon a reference from the then Commonwealth Attorney-General dated 10 May 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">131 The Attorney noted in the terms of reference to the ALRC that the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories were in broad agreement as to the policy that ought to be pursued in relation to the censorship of imported and locally produced films.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">The terms of reference also noted that the ALRC was to draft legislation to give effect to its recommendations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">132 The ALRC observed at [1.7] that the objective of Australian censorship laws is to regulate the availability of films and publications within the broad framework of 'general community standards'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">133 The draft classification bill prepared by the ALRC was in similar, but not identical, terms to the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">It provided, in draft cl 5, that publications and films were to be classified in accordance with the classification code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">134 The ALRC's draft national classification code was set out in a schedule to the draft bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It was a similar table to that which is now contained in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The X classification applied to films that explicitly depict sexual activity between consenting adults where there is no sexual violence, coercion or non-consent of any kind 'in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">135 The ALRC's draft explanatory memorandum did not explain the individual classifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">It merely said that the schedule to the draft bill reproduced the national classification code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">However, in its report, the ALRC observed that classification decisions being made by the existing boards were to be made:
 
 "... on a judgment of how much the material offends, or is likely to offend, the standards or sensibilities of the reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">This judgment is, and because of its nature can only be, a subjective one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">" 
 
 

136 The ALRC recognized the need for classification decisions to reflect the community's views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It said that there should be a strong emphasis on public participation and consultation in the classification boards' work: see [2.5] of the ALRC Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">137 The ALRC also recognized that the classification criteria in the draft code were broad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">It agreed with the need for guidelines but recommended that they be issued by the federal Attorney-General after consultation with the States and Territories: [3.7] of the ALRC Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">It commented that the Guidelines are:
 
 "... an important way of ensuring that the classification criteria reflect community standards, without the need for constant changes to the national code.".</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">See [3.8] of the ALRC Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">


 
138 Although the ALRC did not explain the concept of 'a reasonable adult', three points emerge from its discussion of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">First, the application of the test is to reflect 'community views'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Second, it involves an element of subjectivity, but it is expected to reflect community views through the broadly representative nature of the classifying body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">139 The third point is that guidance as to community standards is to be found in the classification guidelines which are intended to be an expression of current standards, based upon public input: see ALRC Report at [3.8].</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">140 The regime proposed by the ALRC, which is for present purposes virtually identical with that contained in the Act and the Code, is not the same as a majoritarian test for what is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">What the ALRC proposed was that the Review Board make its own assessment of how much the material is likely to offend the sensibilities of the reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">This is a value judgment which is to be guided by the classification guidelines as indicative of current community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">141 The process envisaged by the ALRC was not that the Review Board would simply form an opinion as to whether 51% of the community would, or would not, be offended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Instead, the ALRC's emphasis upon the reaction of the reasonable adult and the importance of community views show, in my opinion, that the process was not to be a mechanistic one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">It was to involve a value judgment about the views of the reasonable adult in the diverse Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">142 As with any value judgment, this involves an element of subjectivity which is not based upon precise measurement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Overseas Authority 
 
143 It is of course critical to construe the phrase at issue in these proceedings in its own statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Overseas regimes are different and accordingly the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions will not, as a general rule, be of assistance in construing the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">144 Nevertheless, it does seem to me that the approach of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins [2006] 4 All ER 602 provides some assistance in determining what is intended by the concept of "offence to a reasonable adult".</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">145 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins the respondent had been charged with an offence under s 127(1)(a) of the Communications Act 2003 (UK), which provided, inter alia, that a person was guilty of an offence if he or she sent, by means of a public electronic communications system, a message that was "grossly offensive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The charges arose from telephone calls to a member of Parliament and his staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">The respondent had strong views on immigration policy and shouted references to "wogs", "Pakis" and "black bastards".</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">146 Their Lordships were of the view that the question of whether a message is "grossly offensive" is to be determined by the standards of an open and just multi-racial society and that the words used must be considered in their context and all relevant circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">147 Lord Bingham observed at [9] that there can be no yardstick of gross offensiveness other than by the application of reasonably enlightened, and not perfectionist contemporary standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">His Lordship concluded at [13] that the respondent's messages were grossly offensive and would be found "by a reasonable person" to be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">148 Lord Carswell said at [18] that the Court's task was to determine whether the communications were grossly offensive "in the eyes of reasonable people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">" His Lordship also said at [21] that what mattered was "whether reasonable persons in our society would find it grossly offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">"
 
149 Lord Carswell also referred at [22] to two factors which justified the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">He said:
 
 "First, it appears that the justices may have placed some weight on the reaction of the actual listeners to the messages, rather than considering the reactions of reasonable members of society in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Secondly, it was conceded by the respondent's counsel in the Divisional Court that a member of a relevant ethnic minority who heard the messages would have found them grossly offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">If one accepts the correctness of that concession, as I believe one should, then one cannot easily escape the standards of an open and just multiracial society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The terms used were opprobrious and insulting, and not accidentally so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">I am satisfied that reasonable citizens, not only members of the ethnic minorities referred to by the terms, would find them grossly offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">" 
 
 

150 This passage provides support for the view that the test of what is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult is not a simple majoritarian one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">It takes into account the wide diversity of views that may be held by different sectors within today's society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">151 Moreover, the decision recognises that what is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult musts be determined in each case in its entire context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">It is not a question of whether the racial labels, or depictions of sexual activity, are likely to cause such offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">It is whether statements or the cinematographic images considered in their entire context meet the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Australian authority 
 
152 Australian authority on offensive behaviour also recognises the need to take account of contemporary standards, the context of the act in question and the balancing exercise that is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">153 In Wurramura v Haymon (1987) 44 NTR 1, the appellants had been convicted of offensive behaviour for the act of sexual intercourse in a private house, at night with the light on in full view of a public street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">On appeal, Asche J said, at 5, that the concept of offensive behaviour depends upon the circumstances in which it takes place and it must be looked at in a contemporary light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">154 His Honour continued as follows:
 
 "No doubt on the question of sexual mores the present age is more tolerant than any in the last century, but there are obviously still limits to what the general public will stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Even in this day and age, performance of the act of sexual intercourse in public would be considered by the normal reasonable citizen of Australia as offensive, and offensive in the sense that some form of legal prohibition should occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">This does not in my mind make the average Australian some form of narrow minded Puritan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">It merely means that he or she accepts that there are boundaries (liberal though they may be) which for the sake of themselves and their families should not be transgressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">" 
 
 

155 Justice Asche also said that behaviour is not necessarily offensive because it offends a particular person; there is a wide variety of personal idiosyncrasies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">He quoted part of a passage from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice but said that, having some Scottish ancestry, he indignantly refused to quote the next few lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">I have no such ancestry, and will therefore happily quote the passage in full:
 
 "Some men there are love not a gaping pig; 
 Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; 
 And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose, 
 Cannot contain their urine; for affection, 
 Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood 
 Of what it likes or loathes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">" 
 

156 His Honour went on to say that the law on offensive behaviour is not for the unduly sensitive or the totally permissive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">It strikes a balance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Construction of the phrase in its statutory context 
 
157 Both Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins and Wurramura v Haymon dealt with offensive behaviour under penal statutes rather than depictions of acts likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult under a film classification scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Nevertheless, the definition of "offensive" in the Guidelines adopts the ordinary meaning of that term, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">material which causes outrage or extreme disgust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Both of the authorities to which I have referred would appear to approach the meaning of the term in that sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">158 It is also to be noted that although the statute under consideration in Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins did not expressly proscribe messages which were (grossly) offensive to "a reasonable person", both Lord Bingham and Lord Carswell proceeded upon the basis that this was to be established in order for a contravention to be made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Lord Carswell drew no distinction between the concept of "a reasonable person" and that of "reasonable persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">"
 
159 The Act refers in s 11(a) to the standards "generally accepted by reasonable adults".</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">By contrast, the description of the X18+ classification in the Code refers to depictions likely to cause offence to "a reasonable adult".</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">This distinction also appears in s 29(4)(a) and s 29(4)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">160 I do not consider that anything turns on the difference in this language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Director of Public Prosecutions v Collins suggests that there is no difference between those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">In any event, in a cooperative legislative scheme which provides for the classification of films, it would be wrong to draw narrow distinctions between "reasonable adults" and "a reasonable adult".</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">161 The words "a reasonable adult" in the X18+ classification are part of a composite phrase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">That phrase has special work to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">It must be considered in light of the objective referred to by the ALRC, namely that censorship, and classification categories, are aimed at regulating the availability of films within the broad framework of general community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The Act and the Code establish a regime for classification of films which applies nationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Community standards differ widely across Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The search is not for one reasonable representative person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The scheme takes account of diverse Australia-wide community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">162 The Review Board said it had regard to the definition of "reasonable adult" either as contained in the Guidelines or in the Macquarie Dictionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">However, the Guidelines (ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The Guidelines for Classification of Films and Computer Games) contain no definition of that term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">(Nor, for that matter, does the Macquarie Dictionary).</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">There is a definition of "reasonable adult" in the Guidelines for the Classification of Publications, 2005, as follows:
 
 "Possessing common sense and an open mind, and able to balance personal opinion with generally accepted community standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">" 
 
 

163 Even if it is legitimate to take this definition into account, it merely serves to emphasise the breadth of the value judgment which is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">The concept of generally accepted community standards involves a judgment about the standards of the diverse Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It is for the members of the Review Board, who are to be broadly representative of the community, to make that value judgment of the film in its full context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The analogy of the "reasonable person" test in the law of negligence 
 
164 In my view, the concept of "the reasonable person" which underlies the law of negligence is of no real assistance in construing the phrase "likely to cause offence to a reasonable person".</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The objectives of the regulatory scheme which govern the classification of films and other publications bears no similarity to the policy considerations which inform the law of negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">165 Nevertheless, the warning recently given by the High Court against a mechanistic approach to the concept of reasonableness is apt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">166 In New South Wales v Fahy [2007] HCA 20 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1021, Gleeson CJ observed at [6], that the balancing exercise to be undertaken to determine the standard of "the reasonable person" should not be described as a "calculus".</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">His Honour said that what is involved is a judgment about reasonableness which is not amenable to exact calculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">167 Chief Justice Gleeson continued at [7] by referring to an earlier authority which pointed out that there are cases in which an unduly mathematical approach to the exercise can lead to an unreasonable result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">See also at [57] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">"Likely" 
 
168 Nor do I think that the word "likely" in the phrase at hand calls for a rigid or technical approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Mr Walters SC, for Adultshop, referred to the discussion of the meaning of "likely" in Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Limited v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 27 ALR 367 at 375, 380-382.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">That question arose in considering the construction of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act where entirely different considerations apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">169 I do not consider that a statutory body charged with the task of determining whether a sexually explicit film would be likely to cause offence need ask itself whether there is more than a 50% chance that this would be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The Review Board must engage in a question of judgment, based upon its perception of the community standards of a diverse community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">It seems to me that the degree of likelihood that it is required to assess is best described by the "real chance or possibility" test to which Deane J referred in Tillmanns at 382.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Summary of the offensiveness/reasonable adult tests 
 
170 In summary, the "offensiveness" test for the X18+ classification in the Code is not determined by a mechanistic majoritarian approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">It calls for a judgment about the reaction of a reasonable adult in a diverse Australian society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">171 The "reasonable adult" test must accommodate the community standards of Toorak and Newtown as well as those of Kunnanurra and Broken Hill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">It must also accommodate the standards of various subgroups within a multi-racial, secular society which nonetheless includes persons of different ages, political, religious and social views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">172 Even if the question of what would be likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult calls for a judgment as to "what most people think," it is a value judgment which is not susceptible to a bright line test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">173 The Code calls for the Review Board to make a judgment on the "reasonable adult" question in deciding whether to classify a film as X18+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">This is plain from the words "likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult".</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Not every film which depicts actual sex will meet this classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Yet on the approach urged by Adultshop, no film containing real depictions of actual sex between consenting adults, where there is no violence etc, would be so classified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">This is because, on Adultshop's approach, no such film would be offensive to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">In light of its own findings on current community standards, the Review Board was correct to reject Adultshop's approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Whether the Review Board improperly rejected the expert evidence 
 
174 No error is disclosed in the way in which the Review Board dealt with the expert evidence or the survey evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">There are three reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">175 First, the Review Board's findings were not directed by an inflexible application of the Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The Review Board considered the evidence but found it unhelpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">176 Second, the expert and survey evidence did not address the question which the Review Board had to answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">That question was whether Viva Erotica depicted actual sexual activity in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">It called for a judgment as to whether the images and the film, viewed in their full context, would cause offence to a reasonable adult member of a diverse society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">177 This question was to be judged by contemporary Australian standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">It involved a consideration of the reactions of a wide variety of adults to the whole of the specific film, Viva Erotica .</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">This question was not answered by evidence at the level of generality of that which was provided by Professor Lumby and Ms Albury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Professor McKee's evidence addressed the wrong question because he focussed only on the attitudes of consumers of sexually explicit films.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">178 The third reason why no error is disclosed is that Adultshop's submissions on this point amounted to a claim for merits review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">This is plain from its lengthy complaints about the reasons given by the Review Board for its treatment of the expert and survey evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Wednesbury unreasonableness 
 
179 On appeal in Brown v Classification Review Board , Sundberg J said that a court should only interfere with the decision of the Board (or the Review Board) if the conclusion was not reasonably open on the material before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">This states the test for unreasonableness in similar terms to that of Gibbs J in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">180 Adultshop submitted that the Review Board's decision was unreasonable within this test on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">First, the Review Board "unreasonably refused to accept persuasive, unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence in deciding that Viva Erotica was offensive to a majority of adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">" 
 
181 The second ground of unreasonableness was said to be that the Review Board relied on facts for which no supporting evidence existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">182 Both of these contentions fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The Review Board was not bound to accept the survey and expert evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Moreover, as I have said, the question for the Review Board was not whether the film was offensive to a majority of Australian adults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">Furthermore, for reasons set out below, the no evidence ground cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">183 Finally, the X18+ classification, as described in the Guidelines, appears to apply in every respect to the content of Viva Erotica .</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">It is difficult, if not impossible to see how the Wednesbury unreasonableness ground can have any application to the Review Board's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The "no evidence" ground 
 
184 In order to succeed on the "no evidence" ground contained in 5(1)(h) and 5(3)(b) of the ADJR Act , Adultshop must do more than negative the existence of a fact on which the decision is based; it must adduce evidence positively establishing the contrary fact: Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at [580] per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">185 This ground of review is confined to findings of fact; it does not extend to expressions of opinion; Reserve Bank Case at [581].</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The fact, as to which there is said to be no evidence, must be shown to be critical to the impugned decision: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222; Reserve Bank Case at [584].</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">186 Adultshop contended that the relevant fact was the finding that there had been extensive community consultation in the process of updating the Guidelines in May 2005 and in the debate over the amendments to the X classification at the turn of the decade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">187 However, the "no evidence" ground is not established within the principles stated in the Reserve Bank Case .</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">First, Adultshop did not positively establish the contrary fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The submission contained in [131]-[134] of Adultshop's written submissions deals with the question of research into community attitudes to the X category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">However, this was not evidence which positively established that there had been no consultation in 2000 or in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Second, the existence of community consultation was not critical to the Review Board's ultimate finding that the film was likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Conclusion and Orders 
 
188 All of the grounds of review fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">The orders I will make are that the application be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">I certify that the preceding one hundred and eighty-eight (188) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
