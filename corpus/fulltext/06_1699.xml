1 This is an appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Riethmuller of 10 May 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 19 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs of 28 July 2004 to cancel the appellant's visa for breaches of s 101 and s 104 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He first entered Australia on 7 November 1995 as the holder of a Student (Temporary) visa class (Class TU) visa, sub-class 560 (student).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He was subsequently granted further sub-class 560 visas through to 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 17 June 2001, the appellant married an Australian citizen, Sara Masotti, and on 5 July 2001, the appellant applied for a Partner (Temporary) visa class (Class UK) visa, sub-class 820 (Spouse) ('temporary visa') which was subsequently granted on 13 September 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 20 August 2003, the appellant was granted a Partner (Residence) visa class (Class BS) visa, sub-class 801 (Spouse) ('permanent visa').</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 In the appellant's visa application dated 4 July 2001 there was a line ruled through the part of question 37 which asked him to give the names and other details of all of his children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">At the time the application was completed, the appellant did not have any children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In addition, he filed with his visa application a curriculum vitae in which he claimed that he had graduated from Swinburne University of Technology ('Swinburne') with a Bachelor of Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant reiterated his claim to have graduated with a degree from Swinburne in the documents lodged in support of his permanent visa in August 2003, shortly before the permanent visa was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 However, there was a change in the appellant's circumstances in that he later had a child by a woman, Thi Thanh Huong Hoang, who was not the nominating spouse in the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Ms Hoang, the mother of the appellant's daughter, had been a friend of the appellant before his marriage to Ms Masotti.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Ms Hoang moved into the house with the appellant and Ms Masotti after their wedding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Ms Masotti worked nightshift and the appellant states that as he was lonely, he and Ms Hoang were intimate on a couple of occasions but did not enter into a serious committed relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">As a consequence Ms Hoang became pregnant with the child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The child was born on 7 January 2003 but the appellant did not advise the Department of the change in circumstances at this time, despite being made aware of the child shortly before the child was born.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 On 18 August 2003, some seven months after the birth of the child, but before the grant of the appellant's permanent visa, and for the purposes of the grant of that visa, the appellant lodged with the Department various supporting documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Those documents included a statutory declaration sworn by the appellant on 11 August 2003 together with a document headed 'Documentation Guide'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In neither of these documents did the appellant disclose the birth of his daughter on 7 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellant claims that he told his wife in October 2003 that he was the father of the child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant and his wife separated permanently in December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 A notice of intention to consider cancellation of the visa was sent by the Department to the appellant on 27 May 2004 primarily concerning the incorrect statements about the appellant's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The appellant, by his migration agent, responded to the notice of intention to cancel the visa on 16 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 On 29 June 2004, the Department sent another notice of intention to consider cancellation of the visa to the appellant concerning the incorrect statements about Swinburne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">This notice explained that further information had come to the Department's attention indicating the appellant had not in fact obtained a Bachelor of Business from Swinburne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Instead he had applied for leave of absence but was subsequently excluded from the course on 16 July 1999 for two academic years, which was extended by Swinburne on 20 December 2000 for another two academic years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In the letter dated 16 June 2004 from the appellant's migration agent in response to the first notice of intention to cancel the visa, the appellant maintained that he had 'pursued various academic courses from which he has graduated'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">8 On 28 July 2004 the delegate proceeded to cancel the appellant's visa and on 30 July 2004, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
9 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision to cancel the appellant's visa by decision dated 19 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In its decision, the Tribunal recounted all the relevant facts and circumstances and noted that there was no factual dispute about the significant events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 The Tribunal found that the appellant failed to declare to the Department that he had not been in an exclusive relationship with his wife and his affair with Ms Hoang had resulted in the birth of his daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Additionally, it found that in support of his visa application he submitted a Documentation Guide on which he failed to disclose the birth of his daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal having found that the appellant had not complied with s 101 and s 104 of the Act in the manner specified, identified that cancellation in this case was not mandatory but discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It then proceeded to consider the exercise of the discretion to cancel the appellant's visa in accordance with reg 2.41 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations').</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">11 In considering the circumstances prescribed under reg 2.41, the Tribunal found that the appellant's extra-marital relationship was likely to have impacted on the outcome of his visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal also found that there was evidence of previous non-compliance by the appellant in his failure to report to the Department when he deferred his studies at Swinburne and his subsequent exclusion from the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">12 The Tribunal noted that in its consideration of whether to cancel the appellant's visa, it had regard to the appellant's false claims that he had a degree from Swinburne and his deception in hiding his extramarital child from his wife and from the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It also considered significant that the appellant and his wife had separated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Tribunal concluded that the grounds for cancellation of the review were made out and affirmed the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 
13 By amended application, the appellant appealed from the Tribunal's decision to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The appellant's case before Riethmuller FM was that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make the decision because it involved jurisdictional errors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">14 The appellant alleged error in the Tribunal's hearing process by not conducting a de novo review and instead conducting the process as if an appeal or judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">However Riethmuller FM found that due to the appellant not disputing that he had separated from his spouse, that he had fathered a child, and that he did not have a degree from Swinburne, there was no call upon the Tribunal to make detailed findings about these issues and instead the Tribunal correctly reviewed the facts and circumstances and exercised afresh the relevant discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">15 In relation to the appellant's contention that the Tribunal had erred in finding that the appellant and his wife were not in a spousal relationship for the purposes of reg 1.15A(1A), Riethmuller FM held that the Tribunal had only to consider the likely effect of the non-compliance on the outcome of the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal had done this and concluded it was likely to have impacted upon the visa application and the appellant had now separated from his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">16 The appellant also alleged that the Tribunal had not considered each false statement made by the appellant separately and instead addressed the matter as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Federal Magistrate Riethmuller found that once the Tribunal identified more than one ground of cancellation, it was not appropriate that each statement be considered separately when exercising its discretion in accordance with reg 2.41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">His Honour held that 'it would create a wholly artificial assessment and exercise of the discretion if these matters were to be balanced against the individual non-disclosures without the Tribunal being able to consider the matter as a whole'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">17 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal should only consider the nature of the relationship up until the time of the grant of the permanent visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The marriage did not break down until after the visa was granted due to the appellant's spouse gaining knowledge of the affair and the child after the visa was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">His Honour found that the Tribunal was not obliged to ignore the undisclosed information in exercising the discretion under reg 2.41, by limiting its inquiry to the time of grant of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">His Honour found that the whole purpose of the provisions would be defeated if the Tribunal were obliged to ignore the undisclosed information in exercising the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The very purpose of reg 2.41(c) is to consider the likely effect of the information on the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
18 By notice of appeal filed 19 May 2006, the appellant appeals from the decision of Riethmuller FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">19 The appellant relies on the following two grounds of appeal from his notice of appeal:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Learned Federal Magistrate erred in law in failing to find [26] that the Appellant was at all material times and in particular on 20 August 2003 a spouse as that term is defined for the purposes of the Migration (1994) Regulations in reg 1.15A(1) and 1.15A(1A).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Learned Federal Magistrate erred in holding at [37] that question 37 in the Form 47SP completed by the Appellant on 4 July 2001 constituted a "question" for the purposes of s 101(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">

20 The appellant sought leave to rely on a third ground of appeal as set out in his submissions:
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">That the learned Federal Magistrate erred in law in failing to hold the [Tribunal] had made a jurisdictional error by failing to find what acts or omissions of the appellant was the non-compliance relied on for either or both of ss 101 or 104 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

 may cancel the visa.</sentence>

 To avoid doubt, sections 107 , 108 and 109 apply whether the non-compliance was deliberate or inadvertent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 

22 Pursuant to s 109(2) of the Act, there were no relevant prescribed circumstances under which the appellant's visa must have been cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The decision to cancel was therefore discretionary: s 109(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Regulation 2.41 of the Regulations prescribes the circumstances to which a decision-maker must have regard in deciding whether to cancel a visa: s 109(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It provides:
 
 2.41 Whether to cancel visa -- incorrect information or bogus document (Act, s 109(1)(c)) 
 For the purposes of paragraph 109(1)(c) of the Act, the following circumstances are prescribed: 
 (a) the correct information; 
 (b) the content of the genuine document (if any); 
 
 
 (c) the likely effect on a decision to grant a visa or immigration clear the visa holder of the correct information or the genuine document; 
 
 
 (d) the circumstances in which the non-compliance occurred; 
 (e) the present circumstances of the visa holder; 
 
 
 (f) the subsequent behaviour of the visa holder concerning his or her obligations under Subdivision C of Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act; 
 (g) any other instances of non-compliance by the visa holder known to the Minister; 
 
 
 (h) the time that has elapsed since the non-compliance; 
 
 
 (j) any breaches of the law since the non-compliance and the seriousness of those breaches; 
 
 
 (k) any contribution made by the holder to the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 Note Under s.109 of the Act, the Minister may cancel a visa if there was non-compliance by the holder of a kind set out in Subdivision C of Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Minister is to have regard to the prescribed circumstances in considering whether to cancel the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 Ground 1 --- whether the appellant was a spouse 
 
23 The first ground alleged by the appellant is that the Federal Magistrate should have found that the appellant was the spouse of the nominating spouse at all relevant times, and particularly at 20 August 2003, being the date the appellant was granted his permanent visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">24 In my view neither the Tribunal nor the Federal Magistrate were required to make a finding in the terms suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The questions for the Tribunal in the present case were whether the appellant had given correct information to the Department, whether he had failed to notify the Department of changes of circumstances and whether any failures in that regard warranted the appellant's visa being cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">25 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal concluded that the reference in the definition of spouse in sub-reg 1.15A(1A)(b)(i) to the Minister being satisfied that the parties to a marriage had a commitment to a shared life as husband and wife 'to the exclusion of all others' had the consequence that the Minister 'could never be so satisfied when infidelity was established'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">26 The Tribunal did not make that specific conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It said that the correct information was likely to have impacted on the outcome of his permanent visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The significance of the statement by the Tribunal is that the appellant's failure to give correct information to the Department may have enabled him to obtain a permanent spouse visa, to which he was not entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">27 The Tribunal had to consider, in deciding whether or not to cancel the appellant's visa, 'the likely effect on a decision to grant a visa...of the correct information: sub-reg 2.41(c) of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In the present case, once the correct information became known, that is, once the appellant's wife discovered that the appellant had had an extra-marital child, the marriage ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">However, this may not be directly to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">If the correct information had been given to the Department about the birth of the appellant's extra-marital child, even if the appellant and his wife had not separated, it is likely that the delegate would have investigated whether the appellant's infidelity, and the circumstances surrounding it, meant that he did not have a genuine commitment to the marriage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">At the time of the cancellation, the Department had some evidence suggesting that the relationship may not have been genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Upon proper investigation, the delegate may have concluded that the appellant did not have a genuine commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others with his wife and the appellant's permanent visa may have been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Ground 2 --- whether question 37 constituted a 'question' for the purposes of par 101(a) of the Act 
 
28 The second ground contended for by the appellant is that the Federal Magistrate should have found that question 37 in the visa application form, which required the appellant to give details of 'All your children', was not a 'question' for the purposes of par 101(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">29 I agree with the finding of Riethmuller FM that the word 'question' has a broad meaning and includes not only a simple interrogative statement but also a sentence worded or expressed in a form such as to elicit information from a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In so finding, reliance was placed on the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford: 1993).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">His Honour, in my view correctly, concluded that question 37 was a question within the meaning of ss 101 and 104 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">30 Further, the real matter in contention is whether an incorrect answer was given for the purposes of para 101(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">So, whether there was a 'question' for this purpose, the matter is placed beyond doubt by the effect of s 99.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Section 99 of the Act operates so that information given by an applicant is taken to be an answer to a question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">That section so far as is relevant, provides that:
 
 Any information that a non-citizen gives...to the Minister...is taken for the purposes of section 100 , paragraphs 101(b) and 102(b) and sections 104 and 105 to be an answer to a question in the non-citizen's application form, whether the information is given orally or in writing and whether at an interview or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">

31 The issue is to identify the information the appellant was asked to provide by completing item 37 of the application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Whatever may be the normal meaning of the word 'question', s 99 operates in this case to mean that item 37 is a question, provided that item 37 relevantly enquires as to the situation of the appellant's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In other words, if the appellant's daughter was alive at the time of completing item 37, would the answer have been incorrect?</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Item 37 is addressed to the appellant, not to the appellant and his spouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Therefore, the reference to 'your' family or children is a reference to the appellant's family or children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I do not see the request as limited to dependent children, as there is nothing in the relevant Regulations, the terms of the application as a whole, or item 37 in particular, to so limit its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">When the appellant was asked to complete the column 'All your children (including from previous marriages/relationships)' this would have included his daughter (if born prior to completing the form).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">I do not regard the reference to 'including from previous marriages/relationships' as doing anything other than directing the mind of any applicant to complete the answer by reference to marriages/relationships other than the one the applicant may currently be enjoying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The information sought after was the appellant's children --- the answer given was correct at the time, but incorrect in the new circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Therefore I would not uphold this ground of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Ground 3 --- acts of non-compliance 
 
32 The third ground of appeal upon which leave to raise is required and which is now asserted by the appellant is that the Federal Magistrate should have found that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by failing to find what acts or omissions of the appellant was the non-compliance relied on for either or both s 101 or s 104 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In support of the proposed ground the appellant made written submissions in the following terms:
 
 The decision to cancel the visa of the Appellant saw two factual matters (the exclusion of the Appellant from Swinburne and the birth of the child) used as the basis for making two possible findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">One is that the Appellant had breached s 101 by not filling in his application in such a way that "all questions on it are answered and no incorrect answers are given" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The first notice specifies a question that has not been answered (AB 47 para 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The second notice does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Another is that the Appellant breached s 104 because circumstances had changed such that "...an answer to a question on a non-citizen's application form or an answer under this section [i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">s 104] is incorrect in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">" The first notice refers to the birth of a child as a new circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The second sets out facts the [sic] occurred before the first from [sic] was completed on 4 July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">This is not a new circumstance for a [sic] 104(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">

33 The Tribunal clearly proceeded on the basis that the incorrect statements in relation to the non-disclosure of the existence of the appellant's daughter were the primary grounds for cancelling the appellant's visa pursuant to s 109.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">34 The Tribunal regarded the incorrect statements in relation to the appellant not graduating from Swinburne and not disclosing that he had been excluded from Swinburne for two years simply as other instances of non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Those instances of non-compliance were matters that were required to be considered under reg 2.41(g) in the exercise of the discretion to cancel the appellant's visa pursuant to s 109.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Whether or not those instances of non-compliance were in fact instances of non-compliance was a factual matter for the determination of the Tribunal and one which the appellant did not dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">35 Accordingly, the Tribunal's approach in cancelling the visa under s 109 was entirely proper and reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Tribunal under the heading 'Grounds for cancellation', set out s 101 and s 104.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">It then found that the appellant had failed to declare to his wife or the Department that he had not been in an exclusive relationship with his wife and that his affair with Ms Hoang had resulted in the birth of his daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It further found that he had failed to disclose the birth of his daughter in the 'Documentation Guide' which was submitted to the Department in support of his application for permanent visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">These were the matters the subject of the particulars of the possible non-compliance given in the notice of intention to cancel the visa dated 27 May 2004 and given under s 107(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">That is, it determined that there had been a failure to comply as described in the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">That clearly satisfies the requirements of s 108 and s 109.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">36 The Tribunal then proceeded under the heading 'Discretionary cancellation' to set out reg 2.41 prescribing the circumstances to which the Tribunal was required to have regard, pursuant to s 109(1)(c) , before determining whether the visa should be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It proceeded to have regard to each of those matters (a)-(k).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">37 In having regard to the prescribed circumstances, the Tribunal noted that there was evidence of previous non-compliance in that as the holder of a student visa the appellant had failed to report to the Department when he had deferred his studies and when he was excluded by his education provider, Swinburne, for two years: reg 2.41(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">This had been the subject of the second notice of intention to cancel the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">As is evident from the Tribunal's reasoning however, these instances of non-compliance were not relied upon as a ground for cancellation, but were matters taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to cancel the visa pursuant to par 109(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It was also a matter referred to in the 12 November 2004 notice under s 359A given to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">However, those instances of non-compliance did not need to be separately considered by the Tribunal pursuant to s 109 as the basis for cancelling the appellant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">38 I am mindful that one must read the Tribunal's decision fairly, bearing in mind that they are the reasons of an administrative decision-maker: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272 and the authorities referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">As Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in that case at 272:
 
 The reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed in the present context, any court reviewing a decision upon refugee status must beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">

See also at 291 per Kirby J and Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35---6 per Brennan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">39 When one reads the Tribunal's decision fairly and in light of the above structure of reasoning, no error is apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In light of my view on this, leave to amend the notice of appeal to allow for the proposed third ground of appeal should not be granted as there are no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">CONCLUSION 
 
40 I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Associate:
