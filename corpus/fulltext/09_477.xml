<sentence id="s0">
 On 16 April 2009 I delivered reasons (the trial reasons) for the making of a declaration that the respondent has been guilty of wilful and contumacious contempt of court on 24 occasions between 7 December 2007 and 25 June 2008 by publishing on the World Wide Web to the public material in disobedience of orders made by Branson J on 17 September 2002 (the September 2002 orders) and in breach of an undertaking given by the respondent to Moore J on 27 November 2007 (the November 2007 undertaking).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I adjourned the matter until 28 April 2009 in order that the parties might make submissions on costs and penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On this application the applicant has sought costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I will deal with that application immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">There is no doubt that the applicant is entitled to an order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The application needed to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The question is, costs on what basis?</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I asked the applicant to provide the Court and Dr Toben with the sum which was claimed for costs on an indemnity basis, which he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The sum which is claimed is $228,852.20, which includes $46,244.89 for solicitor's costs, $161,483.40 for counsel fees and $12,234.17 for travelling and accommodation expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I am not prepared to make an award for costs on an indemnity basis in that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">There were four directions hearings and the trial went for only three days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The applicant's evidence was in affidavit form which exhibited the publications on the World Wide Web.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Those affidavits were uncomplicated and would not have, I would have thought, required the input of Senior Counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicant also provided helpful written submissions at the trial and as to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">However, the sum claimed appears to me to be far too high having regard to what was involved in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Dr Toben would have no prospect of paying costs of that kind if they were awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His financial circumstances are such that he could not pay anything near that amount by way of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There will be an order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It will be for the taxing officer to determine the amount of costs payable on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">At the previous hearing the applicant filed submissions in which the applicant addressed the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">A further written submission was put by the applicant also in relation to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The respondent did not tender any written submissions in relation to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">However, the respondent tendered two affidavits which he had sworn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Dr Toben addressed his history and personal circumstances which are relevant to the question of penalty, to which I have had regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">However, the matters deposed to in the two affidavits were largely irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In the first affidavit he dealt at length with the circumstances which pre-dated the hearing before Branson J and the making of the September 2002 orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He observed that the applicant made a complaint to the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) within days of the commencement of the Adelaide Institute website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He deposed to a complaint that he and another man made to the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth on 5 July 1996 in which they alleged that the Jewish teachings were anti-Christian and contrary to the multiracial and multicultural policy of the Australian Government and violate the United Nation's Human Rights Charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">They requested the Attorney-General's Department investigate "the Babylonian Talmud to ascertain whether any of its contents is in breach of any Australian law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Dr Toben said in that affidavit that he did not receive actual notice of Mr Jones' complaint until 29 July 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">He then detailed his and his solicitor's exchanges with HREOC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He deposed to the course of the complaint and pre-hearings before Commissioner Kathleen McEvoy who was assigned to the hearing of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">His complaint to the Attorney-General was dismissed, so he has said, in early January 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He deposed to a thesis that he received from a New Zealand resident, Dr Hayward, which he said substantially made out his defence which he tendered to the inquiry conducted by Commissioner McEvoy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He alleged that the applicant applied "considerable pressure" to Dr Hayward to have him recant his views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Dr Toben also alleged that Dr Hayward wrote to Commissioner McEvoy at HREOC but that HREOC refused to give him a copy of that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In his second affidavit he referred to the fact that Commissioner McEvoy received a Human Rights award from the University of Mannheim whilst he was imprisoned in Germany awaiting trial in relation to publications which he had made about the holocaust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">He referred at length to the result of the publication of Dr Hayward's thesis and the resultant public controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is difficult to understand how Dr Toben could have thought that any of those matters were even remotely relevant to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The two affidavits suggest that Dr Toben, notwithstanding an apparently high level of education, has some difficulty in understanding the nature of this inquiry and, in particular, the nature of the hearing on penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Any complaints that Dr Toben might have about the HREOC inquiry, which predated the September 2002 orders, could not be in the least bit relevant to a hearing on penalty for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">For those reasons, I refused to admit those parts of the two affidavits which were irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I will have regard to the relevant matters in Dr Toben's two affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The respondent also gave oral evidence relevant to the question of penalty and to which I will also have regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">At the hearing on 28 April 2009 the respondent was again represented by counsel, Mr Perkins who made oral submissions to which I will have regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The applicant contended in his final submission: So far as penalty is concerned, the public interest reasons for punishing the respondent's contempt now outweigh in this case the applicant's private interest in securing obedience to the orders of Branson J and the undertaking to Moore J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">For this reason, the applicant, while he still has an interest (itself a form of public interest) in securing that obedience, makes no submission as to the specifics of any penalty, leaving that to the Court as guardian of the administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It is submitted that any penalty ought be sufficient to achieve the remedial effect of securing future obedience to the orders and undertaking, to punish the respondent's determined challenge to the Court's authority and effectively to deter others from following his example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I think the applicant was right to adopt the attitude expressed in paragraph 8 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Dr Toben's evidence shows an enmity on his part to the applicant and to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry who Mr Jones represents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In those circumstances, the applicant, in my opinion, was right to leave the question of penalty to the Court which in a case such as this has the responsibility of vindicating its own authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There is no need to recount the matters which I addressed in the trial reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It is enough to say that in the trial reasons I reached the conclusion that the respondent had, in disobeying the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking, conducted himself in contumelious disregard for both the orders and the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">For the reasons which I then gave, because the respondent gave an undertaking to obey the September 2002 orders, on each occasion upon which he disobeyed the September 2002 orders he also breached the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I should therefore proceed upon the basis that on 13 occasions the respondent has breached both the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">However, that said, he disobeyed those orders on the various dates stipulated in the trial reasons which indicates an ongoing disregard for the orders of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In particular, he disobeyed the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking within days of giving the undertaking and in circumstances where he had been advised by counsel to comply with the September 2002 orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">No evidence has been adduced on his behalf to explain his conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In particular, he made no attempt during his evidence to give any explanation as to why he has conducted himself in the manner that he has.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is relevant, in my opinion, that as the applicant's and his solicitor's affidavits show Dr Toben has continued to disobey the September 2002 orders and breach the November 2007 undertaking after the trial of these proceedings and whilst my judgment was under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The applicant has deposed to accessing the Adelaide Institute website on six occasions between August 2008 and April 2009 and the applicant's solicitor has deposed to accessing the same website between December 2008 and April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">They have exhibited a number of documents which show continuing breaches by the respondent of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">That evidence has not been tendered and is not relevant for the purpose of establishing further charges of contempt against Dr Toben, but is relevant to indicate that even after the hearing before me the respondent has continued to disobey the September 2002 orders and breach the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The continued publication of material in public defiance of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking indicates a continuing attitude of contumacy on the respondent's part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The applicant tendered a document (Exhibit A), against Mr Perkins' objection, which was a print out of a publication which the applicant said in evidence he viewed on the Adelaide Institute website shortly after 9.00 am on the morning of the hearing on penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The publication on the website was after Dr Toben had sworn his first affidavit and at the same time or shortly after he had sworn his second affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr Perkins objected to the tender on the ground of relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I allowed the tender of the document on the ground that it was relevant to showing the respondent's contemporary attitude to the proceeding before the Court and the authority of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">After the admission of Exhibit A, Mr Perkins applied to call Dr Toben to explain Exhibit A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The document was in the following form: BATTLE OF THE WILLS

<sentence id="s84">

 It is necessary to understand the events to which Exhibit A is referring when it speaks of Mr Pratt and the "indulgence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It was a notorious fact that Mr Pratt was a wealthy Melbourne businessman who on 28 April 2009 was dying and who had been the subject of considerable publicity in the preceding week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Pratt was Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">His race and religion were well-known to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">He was a party to proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia in the Victorian Registry and was seeking a ruling from Ryan J to the effect that a document which he had signed in relation to civil proceedings should not be admitted in criminal proceedings which had been brought in relation to the evidence he gave in the civil proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Ryan J had reserved his judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Pratt's lawyers applied to Ryan J to deliver the ruling urgently so that Mr Pratt would know before he died whether he had been successful on that application and whether the criminal proceeding which had been brought against him would be ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Ryan J responded to the application by delivering his ruling as a matter of urgency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">On the same day as Ryan J made his ruling the criminal proceedings against Mr Pratt were ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The document (Exhibit A) should be understood to refer to the application made to Ryan J and to describe Ryan J's accelerated ruling as an "indulgence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The document invites those accessing the Adelaide Institute website to speculate as to whether Dr Toben will receive the same "indulgence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The readers are also asked to speculate that if such an indulgence is not granted to Dr Toben, "what does this tell us about Australia's justice system?</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">" Dr Toben admitted to being the author of the document and, in particular, writing the two questions after the reference to Mr Pratt receiving an indulgence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He was asked in evidence-in-chief when he wrote the sentence "Richard Pratt received a Judge's indulgence" and his understanding of what had happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He said: 
 "I have been in legal litigation for nearly one and a half decades, and I'm following the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I'm following developments, and only recently Justice Marcus Einfeld was sentenced to prison ..." 

 
He was interrupted by his counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It was also a notorious fact that Mr Einfeld is a former Judge who was recently sentenced to imprisonment for a lengthy period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Mr Einfeld is also Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mr Perkins asked Dr Toben the same question again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Dr Toben said that he had been in Melbourne and had become aware of Mr Pratt's dying and the intense publicity associated with Mr Pratt dying and, in particular, the media referring to Mr Pratt as having received an indulgence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">When he read that in the media he said that the use of the word "indulgence" brought to his mind other things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">His evidence was: 
 I thought of the period of history where we had a total breakdown of the Catholic faith, where indulgences were sold, I think.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It was --- this is what aroused me when I saw the word "indulgence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I didn't quite understand that, because --- and I may add this --- because if a man is sick I fully understand that he should not be brought to court, something that, of course, doesn't happen to those who are labelled Nazi war criminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">

 When asked why it was that he posed the questions in the form proposed he said: 
 To point out that, for example, Marcus Einfeld, who was sick, did not receive any indulgence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He was sent to prison, and now there's Richard Pratt, and now there's here am I.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It is a mere questioning of that --- our cases do reflect what is going on in the court, what is going on in a judge's mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">That for me is an important thing, and that will reflect Australia's justice system, how these difficult cases are handled by judges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It's not an easy task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">

 His counsel then asked him about the second question as to Australia's judicial system and Dr Toben said: 
 That's the future, the development of these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">For example, the Einfeld case clearly illustrated that there was no remission given, as such, for his prostate cancer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He had a similar problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">He has faced similar problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Now, Richard Pratt here is close to death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I just found that it's interesting how --- or the problems the judges have in deciding these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It's very, very difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">And as I maintain that we are still in a common law country, where we can speak freely, and openly, where thoughts are not criminalised, where we are free to speculate, and hypothesise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">

 He was cross-examined by Mr Margo SC, counsel for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In answer to Mr Margo's question about the use of the word "indulgence", Dr Toben said that when he heard the word in relation to Mr Pratt he thought of the Catholic Church selling indulgences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">He said, when asked about the connection between the selling of indulgences and the publicity about Mr Pratt: 
 I am a student of history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">I did not --- I have not in the last --- as Mr Jones would know --- in '96, from '96 onwards, since we've been locked in battle, I have not come across this term "indulgence," and the first thing that came to mind was when this --- there's this historical event occurred many centuries ago, I think, fourteenth, fifteenth century or so, and this is where the term came in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">And so I certainly wondered, what's going on here, and then, of course, I thought of Marcus Einfeld, and I realised, no, the justice system is functioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Therefore, the reason in this case, the indulgence referred to a kind of mercy, that the judge was showing towards Mr Pratt, who was dying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">And as someone who cannot justify himself in court, surely he should not be continued to be prosecuted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The case goes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It drops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">

 Mr Margo put to Dr Toben that his evidence was disingenuous and that what he meant by the questions which he posed was that if he did not receive an indulgence it would "tell us something bad about Australian's (sic) justice system".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Dr Toben replied: 
 Mr Margo, you've been doing this for many years now, and Mr Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">You've been slandering me, you have done this again and again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">

 When Dr Toben was requested to answer the question he said that the proposition was "a nonsense".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I asked Dr Toben what indulgence he was seeking as suggested in the document and he said he was not seeking an indulgence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Margo asked Dr Toben whether it was a coincidence that Dr Toben referred to Mr Pratt and Mr Einfeld who were both Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Dr Toben replied, "Are you feeling persecuted?</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Please don't start that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">" I put to him the following, and he answered: 
 Dr Toben, the question, I think, to put it bluntly, is did you not compare yourself with Mr Pratt and have you not compared yourself with Mr Einfeld this morning, because they were Jewish and you're not?---No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">That's nonsense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It is --- I'm --- and this is where the question that this final thing, "What does this tell us about Australia's justice system", comes in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Very simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">I see it as a very simple thing, but it's got nothing to do with being Jewish or non-Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">We've got to do --- we're dealing here in justice that transcends any --- 

 Mr Margo reminded Dr Toben that he had since the hearing of the contempt charges before me published material which referred to the judiciary as the "Jewdiciary" and that his questions in Exhibit A asked people who accessed his website to compare his treatment with Mr Pratt's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">He was asked whether the document was meant to convey the imputation that people should be alert to see whether a Jew receives more favourable treatment than Dr Toben from this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Dr Toben replied: 
 I would see that as your typical interpretation because this is the tenure of the attack against my person, to defame me, to smear me and to insinuate that I am what I'm not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

 Dr Toben said that the second question implied that in fact the Australian justice system was working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It was put to him that that answer was dishonest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Dr Toben offered an apology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In his second affidavit Dr Toben said: I am advised, and I accept, that in the circumstances that I have been found by this Honourable Court to be guilty of contempt, it is absolutely incumbent upon me to apologise for carrying out the actions which are the foundation of the findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">I do apologise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">I am also advised, that I must acknowledge, and be fully aware, that failure to adhere scrupulously and fully to the terms of orders of this Honourable Court undermines the authority of this Honourable court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I acknowledge that my actions have had that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In his evidence-in-chief he gave the following evidence: 
 Dr Toben, in the affidavit which was filed today you related that you were given certain advice about apologising for what his Honour has found to be contempt of court, and you apologised?---Indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">

 
 Is there anything about that apology that you don't stand by?---It is an unequivocal apology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">This is why I'm rather amazed that this item was brought into court this morning, because I cannot see --- I cannot understand why I'm not allowed to ask questions, express my doubt about these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I cannot --- I cannot follow this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It is not a wilfulness, it is accepting your authority, your Honour, but I cannot understand why Mr Jones feels offended, or says that this is an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">I cannot understand that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I'm asking questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">I don't understand that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">

 
 Now, Dr Toben, in the next paragraph of the affidavit which was filed today, you accepted, did you not, that a failure to adhere to, and comply scrupulously with orders of the Federal Court of Australia undermines the entire system of --- the entire judicial system; is that true?---Indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">And I would be the last one to challenge the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">

 
In the second of these answers the item to which he referred was Exhibit A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">He was cross-examined about his attitude and about the apology which he had given in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Dr Toben apparently had difficulty in understanding propositions put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">He was not apparently able to understand a question put to him that if he were obliged to comply with the September 2002 orders he would thereby be prevented from telling what he perceived to be the truth, notwithstanding that in Exhibit A he posed the question "Do I tell the truth or do I obey the Law?</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">" Next it was put to him that he could not publish material which conveyed any of the imputations in paragraph 2 of the September 2002 orders: 
 Dr Toben, there won't be an order made that in the future either Mr Jones or the court will act as censor or as adviser to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The question that Mr Margo is presently asking you is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Do you accept that if you comply with her Honour's orders made on 22 September 2007 (sic), and comply with the undertaking you gave to Moore J on 27 November 2007, you cannot, in the future, publish information or material which conveys the following imputations, or any of them: 

 
 That there is a serious doubt that the Holocaust occurred; that it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz; that Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence, and some Jewish people, for improper purposes, including financial gain, have exaggerated the number of Jews killed during World War II and the circumstances in which they were killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">
 
 
 Do you accept that you cannot publish any information which conveys those imputations?---Your Honour, I informed my counsel that I have had problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I have done my best to negotiate these orders because they are rather general and confusing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">I now will, from now on, not print anything unless I seek legal counsel, whether it's --- whether --- they will have to interpret the law, these orders, court orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">I can't, I'm at an end, I'm here now, because I have done my best and what's happening is that I've been smeared as someone who is totally unwilling, unable to comply with these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I've done my best.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">But I cannot, without any authority, judicial authority, to negotiate these courts orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The court orders don't make sense to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">They don't make sense to me, your Honour.</sentence>

 MR MARGO: Dr Toben, you had had legal advice at the time you gave --- 

 
 HIS HONOUR: Just a minute Mr Margo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Mr Margo, just a minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">

 
 MR MARGO: I'm sorry, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">

 
 HIS HONOUR: In what way do the orders not make sense?---Because they are so broad that to be limiting --- they are so broad they catch everything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It reaches the point to this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Apparently Mr --- if I may say this, your Honour --- Mr Margo brings this front page and says, "This is evidence of something," and here am I just printing this and --- 

 
 But you're misunderstanding, Dr Toben.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Mr Margo is not putting forward the document, exhibit A, this morning as evidence of breach of the orders?---No, but I'm indicating --- 

 
 No, no, but listen, listen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He's putting it forward as evidence of your attitude?---I understand that, but I'm saying now, this is my problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">

 
 Well ---?---I accept this problem and, therefore, I will submit to censorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">

 
 Well, then can I ask you this question?</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">You say the orders are confusing and you're unable to understand them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">What is it about the order which Branson J made, which says you were not to publish the document about the Adelaide Institute, which was confusing?---That's what --- if you remember, your Honour, I wrote a lot of affidavits which was going to present my case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">

 
 You didn't ---?---And this document I removed, of course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">As you know I removed, in 2000, out of the Human Rights Commission I removed all the material from the website, as I have now; it's wiped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">This document I found on the internet, and I wanted to show that I had nothing to do with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">That the item --- which, by the way, the Germans also used in their proceedings against me, so the Commissioner McEvoy used it as well, and Branson J used it --- that this document, although it's not on our website, it's on this Way Back material --- other material, other websites that I have no control over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">I have never been in contact with The Way Back machine, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">

 It was put to Dr Toben that he had not shown any "real contrition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">He said: 
 There's no real contrition there, is there?---I don't see the contrition --- why should I --- I said to the lady who interviewed me, I said, "Why should I regret anything?</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">I'm doing my very, very best, my very best to negotiate through these orders which I don't quite follow, and I don't even understand why they weren't in force in 2004, and only because I managed to get to Tehran I sort of escaped your legal clutches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">" But the problem is highlighted by this approach, Mr Margo, and that's why I wish you to concede to this, that it is possible that I will submit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It's very difficult for me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">As you see, the last page there's nothing --- nothing offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">But, of course, anything I write may be offensive to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">

 He agreed that he told a reporter on 14 April 2009 before I handed down judgment, "If I'm found guilty, and a fine is handed down, I will, on principle, refuse to pay the fine, so that means I will have to go to gaol, go in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">" He repeated in cross-examination that he unreservedly apologised to the Court for the various acts of contempt since 27 November 2007 and he would stand by and not withdraw the apology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">He also said that he accepted that his conduct since 27 November 2007 undermined the authority of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Dr Toben said in his cross-examination that he considers that the orders which he is obliged to obey are unreasonable and absurd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He was asked: 
 So if we could go back then to the words which appear under Do I Tell the Truth or Do I Obey the Law?</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It's your position, is it, that if the judge takes the view that you should obey the law, obey the law, obey the law, that he is falling in with the program of Zionists and Talmudists?---That would be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The purely --- no judge has an objective, the way I understand the judges acting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">And we see this with the Pratt and Einfeld case where there is that element of the moral dimension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Every judge has that moral dimension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It's all there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">I see no conflict here, except I know that in what's happening in Palestine and so on, that the mindsets are uncompromising, and it flows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">All this flows into the Australian judicial system, how they handle this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It's a reflection --- there's nothing sinister about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">It's an observation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">

 Dr Toben was born in Jaderberg in Germany in June 1944.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In 1954 his parents immigrated with him to Australia, eventually becoming farmers in West Wimmera in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">He was educated in Germany, Victoria and South Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">He completed his matriculation at Edenhope in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Melbourne majoring, I understand, in literature, philosophy and German.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">In 1967 he completed a second Bachelor of Arts degree at the Victoria University at Wellington in New Zealand, majoring in economics and psychology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">While studying in New Zealand, he taught mathematics and English at a secondary college.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In 1971 he enrolled at the University of Stuttgart undertaking a doctorate in philosophy which he was awarded in 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">In 1978 Dr Toben studied for and obtained a teaching certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He subsequently taught in Rhodesia and Nigeria before returning to Australia and teaching in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">He was dismissed as a teacher in 1985 which led to litigation involving his dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Dr Toben has said that he was involved in Family Court proceedings between 1988 and 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">He came to South Australia in 1992, obtained teacher registration and taught as a relief teacher until 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">He has a medical condition which affects his legs, as a result of which he became eligible for a disability pension in 1997 which he still receives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">He will be 65 later this year when he will become eligible for an age pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">He does not own the house in which he lives but does own a house in the western district of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">However, that house is subject to two caveats and he has no equity in the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Dr Toben's only assets are a car worth about $5,000 and some books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">His financial circumstances would not allow him to pay a fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The continuing publications of material in disobedience of the September 2002 orders and in breach of the November 2007 undertaking indicates continuing public defiance of the authority of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Moreover, the document (Exhibit A) which was published as late as the morning of the hearing on penalty indicates, in my opinion, a continuing disrespect for this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The imputation contained in that document challenges the impartiality of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Although Dr Toben rejected the proposition put to him by Mr Margo that his reference to Mr Pratt and to Mr Einfeld was because they were Jews, I reject that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">I find that Mr Pratt was referred to in the document because he was Jewish and that Dr Toben wanted those who accessed the website to ask for themselves whether Dr Toben, being non-Jewish, would receive the same indulgence that had been given to a Jew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Dr Toben made reference to Mr Einfeld also because Mr Einfeld is Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">His explanation as to why he referred to those two persons was disingenuous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">In my opinion, the question as to the state of the Australian judicial system was posed so that the reader might infer that the failure of this Court to grant Dr Toben an indulgence would indicate that this Court would treat a Jew more favourably than Dr Toben.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">An important consideration on the question of penalty for a contempt of court which involves disobedience of a court order is whether the contemnor has purged his contempt and is truly contrite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The respondent apologised to Justice Moore on 27 November 2007 when he gave the November 2007 undertaking but withdrew that apology and indicated he would not comply with the undertaking within days of doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">He has apologised again in his affidavit which he tendered on this hearing and in his oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The apology, both to Moore J and me, was unreserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Whilst the apology has been noted, in my opinion it was given for the purpose of influencing the penalty to be imposed by this Court and for no other reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">It was given at the very last moment and on the advice of his counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">His affidavit shows that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">His answer referred to in [50] of these reasons shows a lack of remorse and contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">I am satisfied that Dr Toben has apologised only because he was so advised and his apology does not reflect a frank acknowledgement of the contempt which has been committed or any true expression of regret on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">I do not accept that he is contrite for what he has done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">His claim that he now recognises that his conduct has undermined the authority of the Court is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In my opinion, he always knew that his conduct would undermine the authority of the Court and his conduct was calculated to achieve that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In his evidence Dr Toben was incapable of addressing a simple proposition simply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">His evidence was often quite confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">He did not answer questions directly but often, as shown in the evidence identified, made speeches which had little relevance to the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">He made a number of references to Nazi war criminals, Jews and Zionists, and he asserted in his evidence, as he had in the document (Exhibit A), that Australia was a country controlled by Zionists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Dr Toben has not attempted to give any explanation in mitigation of his conduct except perhaps his claim that he finds the September 2002 orders confusing, a claim which I reject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">I have taken into account his personal circumstances including his age and his physical disability, although his disability has not been fully explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">I am of the opinion that Dr Toben's conduct evinces a calculated intention to disobey orders of the Court and undertakings given to the Court for the purpose of bringing the Court into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">He has no respect for this Court or the authority of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The applicant brought a contempt proceeding against Dr Toben in relation to his conduct between September 2002 and November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Dr Toben offered an apology and an undertaking to obey the September 2002 orders which brought that application for contempt to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Within days he had publicly withdrawn his apology and reneged on his undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">He thereafter committed 24 counts of contempt on 13 different occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">After the hearing of the contempt charges he continued his public defiance of the Court's authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">He published a document on the day of the hearing on costs and penalty which identified his current attitude to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The applicant brought this proceeding initially for the purpose of having the Court make orders of the kind in the September 2002 orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">He sought and obtained orders restraining Dr Toben from continuing to unlawfully publish material that is likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people or a group of people because of their race or nationality or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The applicant is entitled to expect the orders which he has obtained be obeyed by Dr Toben.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">If Dr Toben refuses, as he has, to obey those orders the applicant is entitled to expect that the Court will do what is necessary to require Dr Toben to comply with the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The Court has the same power to punish contempts as the High Court: s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The High Court has the same power to punish for contempts as was possessed by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England at the time of the enactment of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The High Court Rules 2004 (r 11.04.1(a)) provide that the High Court may order "that the contemnor pay a fine, be committed to prison, or both pay a fine and be committed to prison".</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">This Court has power to punish by way of fine: Coonan &amp; Denlay Pty Ltd v Superstar Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [1981] FCA 197 ; (1981) 57 FLR 118.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The Court has the duty of ensuring that its orders are complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">If its orders can be disobeyed with impunity, public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">There is therefore not only Mr Jones' private interest that must be considered but the public interest in protecting "the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the court's orders will be enforced": AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 107.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">In this case, Dr Toben's conduct has amounted to a public defiance of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He made it clear to the public immediately after the hearing before Moore J that he would not honour his undertaking or comply with the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The Court therefore has an interest over and above Mr Jones' private interest in securing the benefit of the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking and having Dr Toben comply with its orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">His public defiance of the Court's orders has called into play the "penal or disciplinary" jurisdiction of the Court: Whitham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 533; AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The primary purpose to be achieved in this case is the vindication of the Court's authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The purpose of punishment for contempt in a case such as this is to vindicate the authority of the Court by punishing the contemnor and at the same time seeking to deter both the contemnor and other like-minded people from disobeying orders of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Apart from the aspect of punishment, there is therefore a need to have regard to both personal and general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">In Dr Toben's case the question of personal deterrence is more important than it is in many other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">He showed, when he was previously before the Court on contempt charges, that he was when it suited him prepared to apologise for his conduct but then to almost immediately withdraw that apology and refuse to honour an undertaking given to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">He must understand that compliance with Court orders is not optional, but obligatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Like-minded people must understand that people like Dr Toben cannot choose to ignore orders of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">For all of those reasons, a fine would not be a sufficient penalty even if Dr Toben were in a position to pay it which he is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">If I had thought a fine were appropriate, but was of the opinion that Dr Toben could not pay a fine, that would not have been a reason to impose a sentence of imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">If a contemnor is impecunious and the Court thinks a fine is appropriate, the fine would have to be of a kind that the contemnor could pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Impecuniosity could not be a reason to imprison a person when the appropriate penalty would otherwise be a fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">However, because I do not think a fine is an appropriate penalty, his financial circumstances are largely irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">I have reached the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment, although a sentence of last resort, is required in this case because of Dr Toben's conduct --- not because of Dr Toben's financial circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Dr Toben will be imprisoned for three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">I have considered whether it would be appropriate to suspend that sentence by making an order that the warrant for his arrest lie in the Court for a period of time and not issue so long as Dr Toben complies with the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">In the end result, however, I am of the opinion that the conduct has been too serious to make orders of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Dr Toben has shown on a number of occasions that he is not prepared to recognise the authority of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">As I have already indicated but it bears repeating, the proceedings which were before Moore J for contempt of the September 2002 orders between 2002 and 2007 were brought to an end by the respondent giving an apology and the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Immediately after giving an apology and an undertaking he withdrew the apology and failed to honour the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">He continued to disobey the September 2002 orders and breach the November 2007 undertaking throughout the period that contempt proceedings were being organised to be heard between November 2007 and August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">He continued to disobey the September 2002 orders and breach the November 2007 undertaking after the hearing of the contempt charges and up until the time of the hearing for costs and penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">He published provocative material calculated to scandalise the Court in the document published on the website on the day of hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Although he is only to be punished for the 24 charges which have been proved and which were committed on 13 occasions, Dr Toben has now continued his public defiance of the September 2002 orders for a number of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In all those circumstances, it would not be appropriate to suspend the sentence and a warrant for Dr Toben's arrest will issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Dr Toben should understand that even after he has served his sentence of imprisonment he must comply with the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking otherwise he will be liable to further proceedings for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The orders of the Court will be: 
(1) the respondent is to pay the applicant's costs on a party and party basis;
 
(2) the respondent is to be imprisoned for a period of three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I certify that the preceding ninety (90) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
