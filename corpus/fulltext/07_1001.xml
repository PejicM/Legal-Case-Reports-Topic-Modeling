 BUCHANAN J: 
 
1 This judgment concerns the penalties to be imposed upon a union official and a federal union for admitted breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The parties are agreed on declarations to be made and upon the penalties to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Nevertheless, it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the penalties proposed are, having regard to the facts as established or agreed, within the range of penalties that arise for consideration in the exercise of the Court's discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">That said, it has been held that it is not necessary or useful for the Court to be diverted by the question whether precisely the same penalty would have been applied in the absence of agreement (see Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 65 at [57] and [126] applying Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 and N W Frozen Foods Proprietary Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The proceedings were commenced by Application and Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They were originally defended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">They concerned allegations that Mr Lanscar (and through him the second respondent ('the CFMEU')) advised, encouraged or incited Papas Painting Contractors Pty Limited ('Papas Painting') to take discriminatory action against individual contractors which it had engaged and to refuse to use their services because they were not union members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It was further alleged that Mr Lanscar (and through him the CFMEU) by his actions intended to coerce Papas Painting to take discriminatory action against the contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The pleadings alleged contraventions of s 298S(2)(a) and (b) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 as in force on 9 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">5 The offences were pleaded in the following way:
 
 ' THE FIRST BREACH

 (d) During the course of that meeting, the ABN painters were told by Mr Papas in Mr Lanscar's presence that unless they joined the Union, they could not work on the project site.</sentence>

<sentence id="s21">The conduct referred to in the preceding paragraph hereof was: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15.1 carried out with intent to coerce Papas Painting to take discriminatory action against the ABN painters because they were not members of the Second Respondent; and

 15.2.1 Mr Lanscar; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15.2.2 The Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 
 
 

6 Although the particular breaches charged occurred on 9 February 2005 it was pleaded in the Statement of Claim that there had been a previous meeting on 19 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Statement of Claim asserts:
 
 
 '11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">On 19 January 2005, there was a conversation at a meeting which was held between Messrs Papas, Lanscar and Johnstone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 Mr Lanscar, on behalf of the Union, informed Mr Papas that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the ABN painters had to become members of the Union; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the ABN painters did not become members of the Union, Mr Lanscar would close Papas Painting and would stop all its work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">' 
 
 

7 On the first day of the hearing the applicant read its affidavit evidence after rulings were made on objections and opened its evidentiary case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mr Lanscar's diary was produced in response to a notice to that effect by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Leave was sought and granted that it be uplifted for inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">When the proceedings resumed the following morning the applicant called expert evidence from Dr Steven James Strach, a forensic document examiner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Dr Strach had, during the period of the adjournment, examined Mr Lanscar's diary and discovered that an entry in the diary on 19 January 2005 had been altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He provided a written report in which he stated that the alterations were detected by him with the use of infrared and red/infrared luminescence detection techniques.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The diary in its altered form read: ' Meeting with Papas over... wages and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' The diary in its original form read 'Meeting with Papas over... union membership' the words 'union membership' had been heavily scored out on both sides of the relevant page and the other words written in underneath.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Dr Strach was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 Following Dr Strach's evidence the respondents elected to withdraw the defence which had earlier been filed and not to lead evidence in the proceedings or to cross-examine the applicant's witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In these circumstances the allegations in the Statement of Claim stand unchallenged, as does the evidence which was read in the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">9 The orders which the parties asked me, by consent, to make in the matter are as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">BY CONSENT, THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 
 
 
 
 
 a) By making a representation on 9 February 2005 to Paul Papas, a director of Papas Painting Contractors Pty Limited, to the effect that in order to work on the Avenue Apartments site (a site at the corner of Barry Drive and Northbourne Avenue, Turner in the Australian Capital Territory), painters were obliged to join the second respondent, and advising, encouraging or inciting Papas Painting Contractors Pty Limited via Mr Papas to refuse to make use of painting services offered by persons who were not members of the second respondent (whether they were or should have been employees or independent contractors), the first respondent contravened s.298S(2)(a) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b) By making a representation on 9 February 2005 to Paul Papas, a director of Papas Painting Contractors Pty Limited, to the effect that in order to work on the Avenue Apartments site, (a site at the corner of Barry Drive and Northbourne Avenue, Turner In the Australian Capital Territory), painters were obliged to join the second respondent, and thereby intending to coerce Papas Painting Contractors Pty Limited via Mr Papas to refuse to make use of painting services offered by any of its employees who were not members of the second respondent, the first respondent contravened s.298S(2)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 c) By the actions of the first respondent referred to in paragraph 1(a) and 1(b) above, the second respondent contravened s.298S(2)(a) and s.298S(2)(b) of the pre-reform Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">BY CONSENT, THE COURT ORDERS THAT:-

<sentence id="s43">' 
 
 (proposed orders) 
 
 
 
 

10 On 28 May 2007 I made other orders by consent that Mr Lanscar's diary be held by the solicitor for the respondents for a period of one month in order to allow the applicant a period in which to consider whether it wished to take any further action about the matters referred to by Dr Strach in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is not necessary for the Court to deal further with this aspect of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">11 I am satisfied on the basis of the unchallenged assertions in the Statement of Claim and having regard to the evidence in the applicant's case that the declarations in proposed Order 1 are appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It is not necessary, in the light of the parties' agreement that breaches have occurred in the terms suggested, to undertake any separate analysis of the legal elements of those offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">12 The conduct admitted by Mr Lanscar and by the CFMEU is serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It must be regarded as a deliberate breach of a clear legislative prohibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It is appropriate that the penalty reflect this fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 The applicant informed me, in unchallenged written submissions on the question of penalty, that the CFMEU has a prior record of breach of provisions in Part XA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">They are as follows:
 
 * CFMEU v Hamberger [2003] FCAFC 38 ; (2003) 127 FCR 309 - penalty of $3,000;
 * Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 917 - penalty of $5,500;
 * Hadgkiss v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 524 - penalty of $6,000;
 * Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 4) [2007] FCA 425 --- penalties totalling $10,000 ($5,000, $2,500 and $2,500).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">

14 The maximum penalties prescribed for a single course of conduct (which the applicant accepts is the appropriate way to regard the breaches in the present case) are as follows: for an individual - $6,600; and for a union - $33,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">15 I am satisfied that the penalties proposed by the parties in proposed Order 2 are, having regard to the seriousness of the breaches, within the range from which the Court would itself have selected a penalty to impose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In those circumstances there is no need to depart from the penalty which the parties have agreed is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">16 I will, accordingly, make the orders which the parties have, by consent, proposed should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan J.</sentence>
