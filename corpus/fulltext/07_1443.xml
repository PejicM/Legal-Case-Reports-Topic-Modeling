 Introduction

<sentence id="s2">In that document various allegations of fact are made setting out a history of events followed by a number of questions arising out of those events, which the Court is asked to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The procedural question that arises is whether, in order to ensure a complete and expeditious disposition of disputes underlying the questions raised by the liquidator, affected parties should be permitted to file cross-claims in the liquidator's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">There is an element of urgency about the matter which involves disputes about entitlements and priorities in relation to a fund of some $6,400,000 presently held by the liquidator following settlement of a claim against valuers which was funded by IMF (Australia) Ltd (IMF), a litigation funder.</sentence>

<sentence id="s14">3 On 16 September 1998, Meadow Springs was incorporated to acquire Lot 22 at Oakmont Avenue, Meadow Springs in Western Australia, to construct 54 serviced apartments and related facilities, to sell the apartments using a prospectus based product and to distribute the net sales of the proceeds to its shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The apartments and facilities were to face the Meadow Springs Golf Course on the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 The company raised $4,850,000 from its shareholders pursuant to a prospectus lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on or about 24 March 1999 and supplemented from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It applied to KFP to broker a loan of $6, 350,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Subsequently, WCH agreed to advance that amount to Meadow Springs pursuant to a loan agreement dated 24 September 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The loan agreement was secured by a first registered mortgage over the Oakmont Avenue property in favour of WCH and a fixed and floating charge over Meadow Springs' assets.</sentence>

<sentence id="s21">5 Hurly Investments and Casey agreed to advance $1,000,000 under a loan agreement dated 24 September 1999.</sentence>

<sentence id="s29">They raised the funds from private investors initially under an unregistered managed investment scheme and subsequently a registered managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The managed investment scheme (the KFM Scheme) covered monies raised between 3 April 2000 to September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">That was done pursuant to the KFM Scheme Prospectus, the first part of which was dated 21 December 1999 and was common to all proposed loans by or brokered by the Knightsbridge Parties.</sentence>

<sentence id="s40">After 3 April 2000 either KMF or KFP advanced the balance which WCH had agreed to lend.</sentence>

<sentence id="s42">By that declaration of trust KMF agreed to hold on trust the shares of the KFM Scheme investors in the WCH mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The trust did not extend to the charge.</sentence>

<sentence id="s50">11 The statement of claim then turns to advances by HG &amp; R, now known as Balanced Securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It will be referred to as Balanced Securities hereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On or about 24 May 2000 Balanced Securities agreed to advance to Meadow Securities $3,000,000 of the $6,350,000 previously agreed to be advanced to Meadow Springs under the WCH loan agreement.</sentence>

<sentence id="s56">A third registered mortgage over the property in favour of Balanced Securities dated 24 May 2000 secured Meadow Springs' obligations under the WCH loan agreement, the Balanced Securities loan agreement and the Balanced Securities facility agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A fixed and floating charge over the assets and undertakings of Meadow Springs in favour of Balanced Securities dated 24 May 2000 secured payment of money for which Meadow Springs might be indebted to Balanced Securities.</sentence>

<sentence id="s59">That was secured by a fourth registered mortgage over the property in favour of KMF.</sentence>

<sentence id="s61">This is referred to in the statement of claim as the "Second Deed of Priority".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The loan agreement, facility agreement, mortgage and charge were all stamped collateral to the WCH loan agreement.</sentence>

<sentence id="s64">The Balanced Securities facility agreement was not collateral to the WCH loan agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">There were a number of material differences between the two, including the interest payable so that the Balanced Securities agreement did not secure part of the same money as the WCH loan agreement.</sentence>

 72.1 whether the Hurly Investments and Casey have a priority over or are subordinated to IMF for all or any of the amount owing by Meadow Springs to the Knightsbridge Parties by reason of the matters referred to in paragraph 62; and 
 
 72.2 in relation to the amount owing by Meadow Springs to Hurly Investments and Casey under the Hurly Investments and Casey loan agreement: 
 
 
 
 
 
 72.2.1 whether Hurly Investments and Casey are also required to give a credit to Meadow Springs for the amounts particularised in items (ii) --- (iii) to the particulars to paragraph 70 above; 
 72.2.2 further or alternatively, whether Hurly Investments and Casey are also required to give a credit to Meadow Springs for the amount particularised in item (iii) to the particulars to paragraph 70 above; 
 
 
 

36 The liquidator seeks declarations in relation to the questions to be determined pursuant to s 511(2) of the Act and an order that all parties' costs of the proceeding be taxed and paid out of the Claim Proceeds as liquidation expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Procedural proposals 
 
37 At the directions hearing on the first return of the application, the liquidator proposed that the matter proceed on the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">IMF submitted in addition that each of the defendants should be granted leave, pursuant to s 471B of the Act to file and serve a cross-claim against the plaintiff within the scope of the controversy raised by the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Its minute of suggested directions provided for the filing of defences to the statement of claim and defences to the cross-claims, if any.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Counsel for the liquidator said that the directions proposed by IMF were consistent with the orders that he would be seeking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He had also intended that there be cross-claims within the application so that other parties could resolve their issues inter se.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">38 In discussion about the utility of s 511 as a vehicle for this kind of procedure, counsel for the liquidator made the point that the claims of secured creditors were increasing at a rate of $60,000 to $70,000 a month and that it was in the interests of the unsecured creditors to ensure that the resolution of issues between the defendants be conducted in as expeditious a manner as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Counsel for the liquidator supported the IMF proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He suggested that although there might be some scope for oral evidence on the question of a possible estoppel against the secured creditors raised by IMF, there was unlikely to be any controversy about the transaction documents or payments, advances and repayments actually made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">39 Counsel for Balanced Securities had filed submissions opposing the proposal to proceed on the pleadings on the basis that a s 511 application was not a suitable vehicle for resolving questions about the validity of its security, the amount secured by it or the priority to be accorded to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Balanced Securities put before the Court a proposed statement of claim in separate proceedings it proposed to initiate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">A draft of the statement of claim was annexed to an affidavit sworn by one of its solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">40 There was further discussion about the appropriate procedure in this case having regard to the need to proceed in an expeditious fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">41 I reserved judgment until today and in the meantime requested the parties to consult with a view to agreeing appropriate directions in the event that they were to proceed to deal with disputes inter partes under the umbrella of the s 511 proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Statutory framework 
 
42 Section 511 of the Act, which applies to voluntary winding up, provides: 
 
 (1) The liquidator, or any contributory or creditor, may apply to the Court: 
 
 (a) to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company; or 
 
 
 (b) to exercise all or any of the powers that the Court might exercise if the company were being wound up by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">...
 (2) The Court, if satisfied that the determination of the question or the exercise of power will be just and beneficial, may accede wholly or partially to any such application on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit or may make such other order on the application as it thinks just.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 

43 Reference should also be made to s 479(3) of the Act which applies to a court appointed liquidator in a court ordered winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It provides: 
 
 (3) The liquidator may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">

44 It is also useful to recall the source of the Court's jurisdiction in such applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It is conferred by s 1337B(1) of the Act in the following terms: 
 
 Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia with respect to civil matters arising under the Corporations legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 
 
 

 Principles governing the application of s 511 
 
45 There is a distinction between s 511 under which the present application is brought and s 479(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The latter provision applies to liquidators appointed by the Court who are officers of the Court and therefore subject, at least by implication, to its supervision and control and the exercise of its general powers to make orders in aid of its jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In the case of the Federal Court these general powers are found in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Section 511 applies to liquidators appointed to companies voluntarily wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">They are not officers of the Court in the same sense as court appointed liquidators and so the section confers explicit powers to make orders relevant to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Even then, those orders may be supplemented by the powers conferred on the Court by s 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">46 The distinction between the status of court appointed liquidators and liquidators appointed under voluntary administrators, as a basis for the distinction between the language of s 479(3) and s 511 has long been recognised: see eg, Australian Securities Commission v Melbourne Asset Management Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1994) 49 FCR 334 at 348-349 (Northrop J); Deane-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 42 NSWLR 209.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In the latter case Young J said that: 
 
 ... the authorities tend to suggest that the court has the same jurisdiction under both sections...
 

The reasons advanced in those and other cases for the conferral of express powers in s 511 are supported by the comment on one of its many predecessors, s 274 of the Uniform Companies Act 1961, in Wallace and Young, Australian Company Law and Practice (Law Book Co, 1965) at 759: 
 
 the effect of this section (which the court has interpreted so as to give it wide powers) ... is to lessen the distinction between a voluntary and compulsory winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">

47 The facilities provided by ss 479(3) and 511 have a long ancestry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Section 479(3) of the former Corporations Law was considered by McLelland J in Re GB Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (In liq) (1991) 24 NSWLR 674.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">He traced its origins back to the Joint Stock Companies Winding Up Act 1848 (UK) which allowed an official manager to apply for directions from the Master from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">A similar facility has long existed for trustees, administrators and executors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">As McLelland J said (at 677):
 
 These various statutory provisions for directions were a development from the practice of the Court of Chancery under the general law in giving directions to those entrusted with the administration of property under the control of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Two main classes of such persons were (1) trustees of trust property, or executors or administrators of a deceased estate, under administration by the court pursuant to a decree for general administration, and (2) receivers (and managers) appointed by the court in respect of property the subject of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">

48 A direction given or a question determined under s 479(3) or s 511, as the case may be, will protect the liquidator who acts in accordance with the direction or determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In relation to a determination under s 511 it may be an open question whether it establishes a res judicata between the liquidator and any parties affected by it who are named as defendants in the application but neither direction nor determination gives rise to a res judicata as between parties who may have competing interests affected by it: Equity Funds of Australia (In Liq) (1977-78) CLC 40-303 at 29,253-29,254 (Bowen CJ (in Eq)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">McLelland J said in GB Nathan &amp; Co 24 NSWLR 674 (at 677): 
 
 The protection of the official administrator, acting under a direction of the court, from personal liability would not however affect the rights of creditors and beneficiaries as between themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">

So far as s 479(3) is concerned, McLelland J was of the view that it does not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments and that the function of an application for directions under that section is to give the liquidator advice about the proper course of action in the liquidation and not to determine rights and liabilities arising from pre-liquidation transactions (at 679).</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">See also Re JW Murphy and PC Allen (1996) 19 ACSR 569 at 570 (McLelland CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">49 On the other hand there is sufficient flexibility in the procedures of the Court to enable proceedings begun as an application for directions to be converted into proceedings for the determination of substantive rights: Re GB Nathan &amp; Co 24 NSWLR 674 at 680.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In Melbourne Asset Management Nominees 49 FCR 334, Northrop J said (at 352): 
 
 It has been accepted that Courts have power to make final orders in preference claims on an application by a liquidator under sections similar to s 479(3) of the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">There is no logical reason why final orders binding on other persons cannot be made on applications under s 479(3) with respect to other subject matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">

And further (at 352): 
 
 
 I can see no reason why binding orders cannot be made where the parties affected have been given the opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">

50 Given the more substantive character of the applications contemplated by s 511(1)(a) the preceding observations are even more apposite in applications made under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Whether the Court should proceed to entertain applications for the determination of substantive rights and award final relief as between competing creditors and others in an application under s 511, is a matter of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">As Young J said about s 511 in Deane-Willcocks 42 NSWLR 209 (at 212): 
 
 There are many questions where the only order that the court should make is that the liquidator or the claimant proceed in the ordinary courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">However, there are many other situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in a cheap and efficient manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Where this can be done it is "just and beneficial" to exercise the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">

51 In my opinion it is open to the Court, in a suitable case, to entertain an application for the determination of questions under s 511 by joining affected parties with competing interests as defendants and permitting them to file cross-claims for declaratory relief as between themselves and any other interested parties and the liquidator so that there can be a res judicata between all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Such a course may be appropriate where the evidence necessary to determine the questions and the competing claims is largely documentary and amenable to expeditious hearing and determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Otherwise the parties can simply commence their own substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The appropriate procedure in this case 
 
52 On the basis of the information provided at the directions hearing and the nature of the factual matters underpinning the questions raised by the liquidator, it appears likely that the resolution of the competing claims reflected in the liquidator's questions could proceed expeditiously on a largely documentary basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I accept that there may be some oral evidence going to questions of estoppel in relation to IMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Although the proposed statement of claim outlines a somewhat complex and convoluted sequence of transactions, the heavy documentary emphasis suggests that a largely documentary case can be run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">53 I have had regard to the procedure which was agreed between the parties in the event that I was of the view that they could raise their claims against each other in the context of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">I think it is preferable to vary their proposals a little closer to the form of the original IMF proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">On that basis the liquidator's application remains on foot with the named defendants bringing cross-claims against Meadow Springs and such other of the parties as are appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The cross-claims should be confined, as proposed by the parties, to the scope of the controversies identified in the draft statement of claim prepared by the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">In the event that the resolution of the cross-claims resolves all the questions raised by the liquidator then it may not be necessary to make a separate determination of those questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">If there is any question not effectively resolved by the determination of the cross-claims then the Court will be able to consider determining such questions on the basis of the liquidator's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">54 Although it appear unlikely that any additional parties will need to be joined, it will be necessary for both the plaintiff and any cross-claimant to ensure that all parties whom it is necessary to join for a complete resolution of the matters raised by the liquidator's questions, are joined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">They will necessarily have to have the opportunity to apply to the Court for directions as to their participation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">However in default of any such application then it will be taken that the procedural directions generally will apply to them also.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">There will be a general liberty to apply to ensure that there is a degree of flexibility in the application of the procedures leading up to the trial of the application and any associated cross-claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">55 There will be no need for any party to file a defence to the liquidator's statement of claim which merely exists to define the questions he seeks to have determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It can be filed and served as a statement of the case upon which the liquidator bases his questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">56 The parties will be required to jointly prepare a book of relevant agreements and other transaction documents referred to in the statement of claim and any other document to be relied upon by any of them in any cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">I do not contemplate any form of discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I will not order discovery as I do not expect it will be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The parties will be required to disclose documents which they propose to put in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">I do not expect that, save by informal agreement, they will be producing documents to each other apart from those which they intend to rely in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">I will also require the parties to file outlines of the evidence of any witness to be called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The evidence-in-chief of each witness will be oral unless a witness statement is tendered by agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I am prepared to allocate four days for the trial of the action and the parties will be expected to agree to divide the time for the presentation of their cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Consistently with the proposed agreed procedures, the liquidator can tender all transaction documents underlying the questions he seeks to have determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">There should also be an agreed statement of facts setting out a chronology of transactions, events and payments related to the questions in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Further directions can be made as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
