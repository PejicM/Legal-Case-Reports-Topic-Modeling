 EDMONDS J: 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
1 On 14 December 2000, pursuant to subs 86(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ('the Act'), a delegate of the Health Insurance Commission ('HIC') made Investigative Referral No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">223 ('the investigative referral') to the second respondent, in his capacity as the Director of Professional Services Review ('the Director').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The investigative referral concerned whether the applicant, Dr John William Mathews ('Dr Mathews'), a general practitioner, had engaged in inappropriate practice within the meaning of s 82 of the Act in connection with the rendering and initiating of:
 
 &#8226; All services provided within a specified location, namely 11 Patrick Street, Campbelltown, New South Wales, 2560.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">&#8226; All services provided within a specified period, namely on and from 1 January 1999 to and including 31 December 1999 

('the referred services').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Pursuant to subs 89(1) of the Act, the Director conducted an investigation into the referred services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He did not dismiss the referral under s 91 of the Act as he was not satisfied that there were insufficient grounds on which a Committee established under s 93 of the Act could reasonably find that Dr Mathews had engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with rendering and initiating the referred services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 Pursuant to subs 93(1) and in accordance with Division 4 of the Act, on 14 September 2001 the Director set up the Professional Services Review Committee No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">223 ('the Committee') to consider whether Dr Mathews' conduct in connection with rendering and initiating the services listed below constituted engaging in inappropriate practice as defined in the Act and made an adjudicative referral to the Committee for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 The services the subject of that adjudicative referral were:
 
 'ALL Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item 23, 24 and 193 services from the practice location at 11 Patrick Street, Campbelltown, NSW 2560 during the period on and from 1 January 1999 to and including 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 

('the selected services').</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 Dr Mathews was given notice of proposed hearings of the Committee in November and December 2001 but these were subsequently postponed owing to pending litigation in this Court concerning the validity of such referrals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Indeed, the hearings of the Committee were not held until 30 and 31 October and 8 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">7 On 23 June 2004 the Secretary of the Committee wrote to Dr Mathews attaching a draft report prepared by the Committee ('the Draft Report') and inviting him to make 'written submissions suggesting changes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The letter went on:
 
 'The Draft Report is provided to ensure that you are fully informed of the Committee's preliminary finding and to allow you every opportunity to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">' 
 

8 By letter dated 30 September 2004 the Secretary of the Committee sent Dr Mathews, in accordance with s 106L of the Act, a final report of the Committee signed by the members of that Committee and dated the same date ('the Final Report').</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The letter went on to say:
 
 'In accordance with subsection 106L(4) of the Act, a copy of this Final Report will be given to the Determining Authority not earlier than 28 days after the day this copy is given to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">' 
 

9 On 2 November 2004 Dr Mathews instituted this proceeding by the filing of an application for an order of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The application has been amended on at least two occasions and on the first day of the hearing I gave leave to Dr Mathews' counsel to file a second further amended application for an order of review ('the Application').</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Application invokes the jurisdiction of this Court under ss 5 and 6 of the Administration Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act') and s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to review:
 
 (i) The decision, conduct or action of HIC on or about 14 December 2000 to make an investigative referral to the Director under subs 86(1) of the Act in respect of the conduct of Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">(ii) The decision, conduct or action of the Director on or about 14 September 2001 to set up a Committee comprising the third respondents to make an adjudicative referral to them under s 93 of the Act in respect of the conduct of Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">(iii) The decision, conduct or action of the Committee in preparing and delivering to Dr Mathews for his submissions a draft report on or about 23 June 2004 regarding the Committee's preliminary findings as to the conduct of Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">(iv) The decision, conduct or action of the Committee in preparing and giving to the Determining Authority a Final Report dated 30 September 2004 regarding the conduct of Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

10 The grounds of the Application are diverse and have changed in a number of respects from the time of the institution of the proceeding until the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Grounds 1A, 1B and 1C raise constitutional grounds which, apparently, by order of a judge of this Court, are to be heard separately by another judge of this Court, leaving grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Grounds 1, 2 and 6 have been abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Ground 7 is not a separate ground; it appears to be conclusive of something that has preceded it, however, it is not clear whether this is abandoned ground 6 or some earlier ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Similarly, grounds 9 and 11 are conclusive and do not raise separate grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">This leaves grounds 3, 4, 4A, 5, 8 and 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">THE GROUNDS OF REVIEW 
 Ground 3 
 
11 Ground 3 is as follows:
 
 ' [The Committee's] preparation of the Draft Report involved a breach of the rules of natural justice (s 39B of the Judiciary Act , and s 5(1)(a) of the ADJR Act) and/or the procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with [the Committee's] preparation of the Report were not observed (ADJR Act ss 5(1)(b) and 6(1)(e), or s 5(1)(e)) in that [the Committee] breached s 106KD(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">[The Committee] failed to set out in the Draft Report: 
 
 
 
 (a) Its proposed findings on material questions of fact; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Refer to the [evidence] upon which the proposed findings were based (Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 25D); and/or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Its reasoning processing or sufficient reasons for it making the preliminary conclusions; 
 
 
 
 
 so as to allow [Dr Mathews] to respond at all or in a meaningful fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">' 
 

12 The Application contains the following particular in support of this ground of review:
 
 'Nowhere in the body of the report, nor the appendices, does [the Committee] employ a chain of reasoning analysing the evidence, leading from what did, may have, or did not occur in connection with the provision of the services under review, to findings of inappropriate practice, so as to expose a process of reasoning at all or one sufficient to allow [Dr Mathews] to respond or respond meaningfully, as was intended under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">' 
 

13 There are a number of difficulties with this ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">First, while the Application seeks to review the decision, conduct or action of the Committee in preparing the Draft Report, it does not state that Dr Mathews is aggrieved by the Draft Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It asserts that he is aggrieved by the Final Report because it exposes him to sanction by the Determining Authority under Part VAA of the Act, however, it could not be suggested that he is aggrieved by the Draft Report on that basis: See s 106KD of the Act; cf., s 106KL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Moreover, the Application does not contain any prayer for relief in respect of the Draft Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">14 Second, the Draft Report has no impact on rights and is not a reviewable decision because it is neither final nor operative, nor is it substantive in character: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The preparation of the Draft Report is not reviewable as 'conduct' engaged in for the purposes of making a decision in circumstances where it is superseded by a final and operative decision that is reviewable, that is, the Committee's Final Report: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Ozmanian (1996) 71 FCR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">15 Third, at the time when the Draft Report was prepared, the Act contained no statutory requirement that it contain reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Subsection 106KD(1A), which provides that 'a draft report must set out the reasons for the preliminary findings' did not come into force until 1 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It does not apply to the present case --- see Item 118(1) Schedule 1, Health Insurance Amended (Professional Services Review and Other Matters) Act 2002 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), which operates only where there is such a statutory requirement, did not apply to the Draft Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Dr Mathews' contention to the contrary was rejected in Dimian v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCA 1615 at [78] --- [80] per Jacobson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I agree with his Honour's view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">16 In any event, this ground cannot be sustained because the Draft Report does contain reasons --- see ground 4 below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Ground 4 
 
17 Ground 4 is as follows:
 
 ' [The Committee] failed to observe procedures that it was required to observe by law (ADJR Act, s 5(1)(b) or 5 (1)(e)), in the making of its Final Report in that it failed to make or set out: 
 
 
 
 (a) Findings or sufficient findings on material questions of fact; and it 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Failed to refer to the evidence upon which those findings were based (the Act, s 106L and Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , s 25D) and/or it 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Failed to expose its reasons or sufficient reasons for making its ultimate conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">' 
 
 
 

18 The Application contained the following particular of this ground of review:
 
 'The Final Report did not set out specific findings as to what did, did not, or may have occurred in the provision of the services under review (for instance, making assertions in most cases that services "lacked clinical input" without making specific factual findings to underpin the assertion, referring to the evidence on which it was based or setting out its reasoning process).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 
 

19 There are two bases why, in my view, this ground of review cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">First, while subs 106L(1) of the Act contains requirements that the Committee must set out its 'findings' or the 'findings' of the Committee members, judicial observations on s 106L indicate that Dr Mathews' criticisms of various deficiencies in the Draft Report and Final Report are unwarranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Beaumont J said in his dissenting judgment in Adams v Yung (1998) 83 FCR 248 at 284F:
 
 'In my opinion, the Committee addressed the correct legal question posed by s 106L(1)(a), and no other legal error in the Report has been demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In particular, in my respectful opinion, the Committee was not bound to make findings in respect of individual patients in its Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Its duty was to report on Dr Yung's conduct in relation to all of his Kirrawee patients over the year in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 

20 The majority in Yung (Burchett and Hill JJ) did not comment on the Committee's obligations under s 106L, but in Lee v Maskell-Knight [2004] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 207 ALR 362 at [43] , Hill and Marshall JJ quoted Beaumont J's remarks with apparent approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Heerey J also commented on s 106L in Mercado v Holmes [2000] FCA 620 , overturned on appeal at [2000] FCA 1848 ; (2000) 111 FCR 160, but without any disapproval of this comment: 
 
 '... the task of the Committee is not to make a finding as to the occurrence or otherwise of a specific event but, pursuant to s 106L, to express an opinion in generalised and conclusionary terms by reference to a subjective and value-laden criterion, namely what members think the general body of general practitioners would think about the conduct in question: s 82(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">' 
 

21 Second, while s 106L does not contain a requirement that the Committee is to set out reasons in its Final Report, the Committee did give reasons for its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As Dr Mathews' counsel acknowledged, the Draft and Final Reports are similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It suffices to identify the relevant portions of the Final Report:
 
 &#8226; The Committee explained its findings regarding Item 23 services in general terms at [52] --- [64], and addressed each of the thirty services in the 'exploratory sample' individually in Appendix 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">&#8226; The Committee explained its findings regarding Item 24 services in general terms at [69] --- [76], and addressed each of the thirty services in the 'exploratory sample' individually in Appendix 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">&#8226; The Committee explained its findings regarding Item 193 services in general terms at [84] --- [88], and addressed each of the thirty services in the 'exploratory sample' individually in Appendix 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 Ground 4A 
 
22 Ground 4A is as follows:
 
 'Further or in the alternative, [the Committee] denied [Dr Mathews] natural justice or failed to accord him procedural fairness in the making of the Report in that: 
 
 
 
 (a) No reasons or sufficient reasons for the preliminary findings were provided to him in the body of the Draft Report or at all prior to the making of the Report as were required to be provided by the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">[Dr Mathews] was thereby denied the ability to respond or meaningfully respond to the apparent concerns of [the Committee] ; and/or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) No reasons or sufficient reasons for the findings in the Report were provided to him as were required to be provided by the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">[Dr Mathews] was thereby denied the ability to understand the reasoning process of [the Committee] in the making of the Report and to identify errors, if any.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">' 
 
 
 

23 With respect, I also have difficulty with this ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Indeed, counsel for Dr Mathews accepted that there is no 'general law' requirement that administrative decision-makers must give reasons: Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In that case, it was acknowledged by Gibbs CJ (at 670) and by Deane J (at 676) that there may be 'special circumstances' where natural justice requires reasons to be given, however, only one instance was cited in which 'special circumstances' have been found in the intervening period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">This suggests that 'special circumstances' are particularly rare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">24 On behalf of Dr Mathews, it was submitted that the legislative context in the present case gives rise to such 'special circumstances'; the statutory provision regarding the drawing and provision of a draft report and permitting further submissions on it from an applicant would be meaningless unless the reasoning were to be exposed both as a necessary matter of statutory construction and as a matter of procedural fairness to Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Whether or not this is so, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the Committee did give reasons in its Draft Report --- see ground 4 above --- and it is idle to suggest that an applicant who is able to produce submissions responding to virtually every sentence in the Draft Report was not informed about the reasoning process which the Committee had adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I agree with this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Ground 5 
 
25 Ground 5 is as follows:
 
 ' [The Committee's] Draft and Final Reports, considered together, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, in that a fair-minded lay-person, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings and the matters in issue, who is aware of the evidence and submissions in the proceedings, including the further evidence provided by [Dr Mathews] after the hearing, would consider that [the Committee] was biased against [Dr Mathews] , in the sense that their mind was closed to the issues raised by [Dr Mathews] and nothing [Dr Mathews] said after the preparation of the Draft Report could have changed the view that [the Committee] had taken about [Dr Mathews'] case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">' 
 

26 The Application contains the following particulars with respect to this ground of review:
 
 
 '(i) Nowhere in the appendices to the Final Report, in which the purported reasons for the material findings were outlined, is there any express acknowledgment of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) But for formal acknowledgement that the submissions and evidence were received, and several minor modifications, no change to the findings or reasons for findings is made as a result of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) [Dr Mathews'] oral evidence, accepted with little comment at the hearing, is barely referred to in either the body of the report or the appendices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 
 
 
 
 (iv) [The Committee] failed to undertake its own random sampling in accordance with s 106K of the Act, relying instead on a pool of samples drawn by [HIC] and already examined in detail by the [Director] (in his investigation prior to the Adjudicative Referral) and already found by him (or his officers, servants and agents) to have been sufficiently deficient and/or adverse to [Dr Mathews] to cause him to refer the matter to [the Committee] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The pool was accordingly, no longer a random sample by any definition of that expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 
 
 

27 Dr Mathews submits that the Final Report contains only the most grudging and minor amendments (styled by the Committee as 'clarification' --- see [98] of the Committee's Final Report), makes no acknowledgement of Dr Mathews' further evidence, and, in the main, ignores Dr Mathews' submissions entirely and is, for those reasons, affected by apprehended bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">28 In relation to this ground, I was referred to what was said by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [28] as to the proper test to be applied for apprehended bias in the case of administrative proceedings held in private.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">To fully appreciate what their Honours there said, one needs to refer also to the surrounding context of [27] --- [31] inclusive:
 
 ' [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of "a fair-minded lay observer" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 [29] Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 [30] Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented -- often vigorously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Similar questions by a judge in curial proceedings in which the parties are legally represented may more readily give rise to an apprehension of bias than in the case of inquisitorial proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 [31] Where, however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person whose evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">If that should happen, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision-maker's view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 

29 There is no submission on behalf of Dr Mathews in relation to this ground of apprehended bias that he was overborne or intimidated by vigorous testing of his evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses at the hearing before the Committee such as to lead a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person to infer that there is no evidence he could give which could change the Committee's view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The only basis of this ground is put in terms of [27] supra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">30 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Dr Mathews' contention that the Committee ought to have had regard to unspecified 'further evidence' allegedly incorporated in his submissions on the Draft Report should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It was submitted that while Dr Mathews was entitled to make '... written submissions suggesting changes to the Draft Report ...', he was not entitled to give evidence --- see subs 106KD(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">31 The Committee was required to prepare a Draft Report setting out its preliminary findings --- subs 106KD(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It was submitted that the fact that those views were unfavourable to Dr Mathews is not, of itself, evidence of bias or pre-judgment: see Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431 at [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That is undoubtedly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">32 The Committee discussed Dr Mathews' submissions on the Draft Report in the Final Report at [95] --- [100].</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It declared at [96] that after careful consideration of the submissions, it was not persuaded to change its finding that Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Dr Mathews characterises his submissions as 'careful, detailed and reasoned' and the amendments which the Committee made in its Final Report as 'grudging and minor', but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language, without more, is unhelpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It was further submitted that, in essence, Dr Mathews' contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the Committee did not accept the changes to the Draft Report which he proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In my view, there is substance in that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">33 Dr Mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged pre-judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">These were summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions as follows:
 
 ' (a) Appendix 1, service no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">4 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 30 October 2003 the applicant told the Committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist, ordered an IGE test, thinks he performed a spirometry test and that "the management plan for her was Ventolin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">" 
 
 In the Draft Report the Committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patient's presenting problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I do not accept this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I referred the patient to an allergy specialist; ordered an IGE pathology test and performed a spirometry test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I had also been prescribing her Ventolin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 
 
 
 (b) Appendix 2, service no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">1 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">At the Committee's request, he read out his clinical note: "Vomiting, Promethazine, 4 u.e., urea, electrolytes and creatinine which is --- in those days --- I think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days I think.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">"
 
 In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that "At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">"
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I did record a selective history of "vomiting".</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">I knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of Promethazine and I advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function, kidney function and the state of her hydration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">"
 
 In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">
 
 
 
 (c) Appendix 2, service 3 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">He read out his clinical note: "FOC, Ceclor CD, Ventolin and Becloforte.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In answer to a question about whether he performed a peak-flow reading, he said: "I did not perform a peak flow reading, it is not written down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I do not know whether I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Sometimes --- yes I did but it is not written down there so I do not recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that "At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">No peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">"
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: "I did record a selective history with my shorthand notation 'FOC'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The patient's history of asthma and smoking was known to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I did record my management plan which was to prescribe Ceclor for his chest infection; Ventolin and Becloforte for the patient's asthma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the Committee cannot make such a finding (see T p 26 line 31 ff).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">"

 (d) Appendix 3, service 15 
 
 
 
 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that: "I gave him the Ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner, Christine, who was an invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">So in a fashion he was a carer, and as I said, his legs --- he had been my patient for probably 15 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">"
 
 The applicant also told the Committee that: "The presenting complaint with Ron was that he was --- had massive anxiety because he was worried about Christine and his knees --- there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before, that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine, because when Christine fell over he would have to pick her up, and as I said he has --- I have asked him to have his knees x-rayed many, many times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">He has never had it x-rayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He is non-compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia: "No evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input, limited examination and management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In Dr Mathew's oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for Ducene for the pain to damaged knees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">"
 
 The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report that: "I do not agree with this view of the consultation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">At T p 49 line 32, I said that I gave Ducene in an attempt to reduce the patient's alcohol consumption, not for pain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">My oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patient's household.</sentence>

34 However, in response it was submitted that the examples involved judgments by the Committee on issues which it was required to determine; the adequacy of management plans, whether a particular history amounts to a 'selective history', whether the evidence indicated that the requirements of the relevant MBS Item were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">These are matters upon which reasonable minds may differ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The third and fourth examples also involved alleged errors of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Further, Dr Mathews has not explained how being unpersuaded by his submissions, or making a factual error about the reason why a drug was prescribed, would lead to the conclusion that the Committee did not bring an open mind to its task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It was submitted that the onus lies on Dr Mathews to prove his claim of apprehended bias and the examples he has given fall well short of demonstrating that a disinterested informed observer would form the necessary conclusions about the Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">35 I am not persuaded, on the evidence to which I was taken, that this ground is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Even accepting that the test is one of objective possibility, I am not persuaded that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Committee might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided --- whether Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the selected services.</sentence>

 6 Preliminary random sample 
 
 
 
 In having regard, under subsection 106K (1) of the Act, only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services, a Committee must ensure that the sample (the preliminary random sample ) is a random sample.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 
 
 7 Appropriate sample size 
 
 
 
 
 (1) The preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95% confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within +/- 10% of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled, at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50% of services rendered or initiated (the incidence requiring the largest sample).</sentence>

 where: 
 
 N = class size.</sentence>

 8 Exploratory sample

 (a) examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services) (the exploratory sample ) , randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample; and

39 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Paragraph (d) contains the first allegation of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Dr Mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, in particular the words 'must ensure', when used in relation to the words 'that the sample (the preliminary random sample) is a random sample', effectively requires the Committee to undertake the sampling itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Alternatively, it is said that if s 6 does not require the Committee to do the sampling itself, it requires the Committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services, included in a particular class of selected services, is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the Committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class, derived from a larger list of services of that particular class, 'fed' to them by the Director, even if the Committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">40 The primary submission can be rejected out of hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">On no construction of s 6 of the Sampling Determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the Committee itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">41 It is not advanced on behalf of Dr Mathews, nor could it be, that the samples provided to the Director by HIC (see [44] infra) are not random samples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The alternative submission is that, in terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, the Committee must ensure that the samples are random samples and that requirement is not satisfied where the Committee proceeds on an understanding that certain services were randomly sampled by HIC at the request of the Director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">There is no doubt that the Committee proceeded on that understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">At [100] of the Final Report, the Committee wrote:
 
 'The Committee understands that certain services were randomly sampled by the HIC at the request of the Director (to facilitate his review) --- this is exhibited by the words "Randomly Selected Services Rendered to Patients ..." in the header of each of the lists of services in Attachment C of the Adjudicative Referral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">' 
 

42 Attachment C was not in evidence but is described in [6] of the Adjudicative Referral dated 14 September 2001 in the following terms:
 
 'Lists provided by the Health Insurance Commission of randomly selected MBS item 23, 24 and 193 services rendered by Dr Mathews during the referral period; photocopies of medical records of a selection of patients from these lists to whom Dr Mathews rendered services during the referral period; and calendar charts ("PIRT reports") provided by the Commission of all services rendered during the referral period in relation to these patients.</sentence>

43 The starting point for the lists that are Attachment C to the Adjudicative Referral dated 14 September 2001 is the request dated 19 December 2000 by the Director of the Professional Review Division of HIC in the following terms:

48 The only observation I would make to this extract from the Committee's Draft Report is to observe, in relation to footnote 18, that it is common ground that the Director also provided the Committee with a list of 40 sample services for MBS Items 24 and 193.</sentence>

50 No challenge is made to the number of total services stated to be rendered by Dr Mathews for each relevant MBS Item during the referral period, namely 8,947 for item 23, 2,406 for item 24 and 1,366 for item 193.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">51 However, challenge is made to the 'preliminary random sample' size of 90 for each relevant MBS Item in the Final Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is common ground that applying the formula in s 7(2) of the Sampling Determination to the total services rendered during the referral period for each relevant MBS Item, the 'preliminary random sample' sizes were:
 
 Item 23 99
 Item 24 96
 Item 193 93 

52 Of itself, the fact that incorrect numbers are given in the Final Report for the number of services in each 'preliminary random sample' does not, in my view, infect the integrity of each sample as a random sample.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">53 In short, in the absence of any challenge that the HIC lists are not random samples, the Committee was entitled to proceed on the understanding that it did, and the obligation of the Committee under s 6 of the Sampling Determination that it ensure the samples are random samples is satisfied.</sentence>

<sentence id="s260">I am unable to identify any obligation of the Committee, under the Sampling Determination, to ensure itself that each 'preliminary random sample' was in fact of an 'appropriate sample size' within the meaning of s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Section 7 undoubtedly requires the 'preliminary random sample' to be of an 'appropriate sample size'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">However, provided the number of services in a relevant class of service specified in a referral satisfies the formula in subs 7(2) of the Sampling Determination, the 'preliminary random sample' will be of an 'appropriate sample size'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In the present case, HIC lists did satisfy, in terms of the number of services in each relevant class of service specified in the referral, the formula in subs 7(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The fact that the Committee, in its Final Report, incorrectly stated what that number of services was for each relevant class of service, does not, in my view, detract from that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">It follows, in my view, that this second allegation of error must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">56 Paragraphs (f) and (g) together contain the third allegation of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It is said that the Committee had regard to a sample size of 90 services in each relevant class of service provided by Dr Mathews in the referral period when the correct sample size calculated in accordance with the formula in subs 7(2) and (3) of the Sampling Determination should have been:
 
 99 services for MBS Item 23
 96 services for MBS Item 24
 93 services for MBS Item 193 


It follows, so it is said, that the Committee failed to comply with the Sampling Determination in that it failed to have regard to the 'appropriate sample size'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">57 This allegation of error overlaps with the second allegation, although, to be fair, it is articulated in different terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">However, the fact remains that the Committee did not have regard to a sample size of 90 services in each relevant class of service provided by Dr Mathews in the referral period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Nor did the Committee have an obligation under the Sampling Determination to have regard to the numbers of services referred to in [56] supra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The only obligation of the Committee to have regard to a number of services in each relevant class of service is the obligation to be found in s 8 of the Sampling Determination, and that obligation is that the Committee must examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services), randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample and determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The provisions of s 8 of the Sampling Determination form the basis of the fourth allegation of error (see [58] infra), however, I can find no foundation in the Sampling Determination for this third allegation of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">For the sake of completeness, I would merely add that the fact that the Committee incorrectly stated the number of services in the 'preliminary random sample' for each relevant class of service in its Final Report, provides no basis for error of the kind alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">58 Paragraphs (h) and (i) contain the fourth allegation of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It is said that the Committee had regard to 30 services of Dr Mathews in each relevant MBS Item class of service purportedly as an 'exploratory sample' within the meaning of that expression in s 8(a) of the Sampling Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It is further said that the Committee failed to examine samples 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample' within the meaning of that expression in s 8(a) of the Sampling Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The Committee, it is said, merely examined the first 30 services on lists of the first 40 services taken from the HIC lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">They were not, therefore, 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">59 There is no doubt that the Committee examined the first 30 services on lists of the first 40 services taken from the HIC lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">To be completely accurate, the Committee did not examine service nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">6, 8 and 9 for MBS item 23 owing to lack of records maintained by Dr Mathews but it examined the remainder of the first 30 services as well as nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">31, 32 and 33; it did not examine service nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">18 and 24 for MBS item 24 owing to lack of records maintained by Dr Mathews but it examined the remainder of the first 30 services as well as nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">31 and 32; and it did not examine service nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">5 and 9 for MBS item 193 owing to lack of records maintained by Dr Mathews but it examined the remainder of the first 30 services as well as nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">31 and 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">60 Professor D F Nicholls from the School of Finance and Applied Statistics at the Australian National University, Australian Capital Territory, gave evidence on behalf of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">In relation to this fourth allegation of error, his report recorded the following:
 
 'While the Determination states that the exploratory sample should be "randomly" drawn from the preliminary sample, from a statistical point of view to state that it should be randomly drawn from a random sample is redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The preliminary random sample is a sample randomly drawn from the total number of services rendered for each class of services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Consequently any sample chosen from the preliminary random sample will itself be a random sample (of the total number of services of the item class under review) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The exploratory sample of 30 services, for each of items 23, 24 and 193 will themselves be random samples from each of their respective items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">... 
 
 As has been argued above, the preliminary samples for each of the three items have been confirmed by the HIC to be random.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Any subset of services chosen from a preliminary random sample will itself be a sample of random services from the total number of services of each item under investigation .</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">' (Emphasis)
 

61 Dr M J Stevenson from the School of Business, Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Sydney, New South Wales, gave evidence on behalf of Dr Mathews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">In response to Professor Nicholls, Dr Stevenson said:
 
 'Had the Committee, in following section 6 of the Determination, ensured that the preliminary random sample was a random sample and, in doing so by independently selecting a sample of 99 records randomly from a sampling frame of 8,947 records then, it might be argued from a statistical point of view that to insist the exploratory sample of 30 be further selected randomly is redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">In this case, the exploratory sample of 30 would be random irrespective of how the smaller sample of 30 records comprising the exploratory sample were selected from the preliminary random sample of 99.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">' (Emphasis)
 

62 However, with respect to both Professor Nicholls and Dr Stevenson, the issue raised by this allegation of error is not whether the first 30 (record available) services of each relevant item of service is a random sample of the total number of services of each relevant item of service specified in the referral , but whether the first 30 (record available) services of each relevant item of service are 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">One has only to put the issue in those terms to realise that what the Committee examined as 'exploratory samples' is infected with error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">63 The fact that the first 30 (record available) services of each relevant item of service is a random sample of the total number of services of each relevant item of service specified in the referral by reason that it is a sub-set of services chosen from a preliminary random sample which, by definition, is a random sample, is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Unless those first 30 (record available) services of each relevant item of service is randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample, it is not an 'exploratory sample' for the purposes of the Sampling Determination: s 8(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">64 Relevantly, the Oxford English Dictionary meaning of the word 'random' provides:
 
 
 ' b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Statistics .</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Governed by or involving equal chances for each of the actual or hypothetical members of a population; also, produced or obtained by a random process (and therefore completely unpredictable in detail);' 
 
 
 

Under the same heading 'Statistics', the phrase 'random sample' is defined to mean ---
 
 
 'A sample drawn at random from a population, each member of it having an equal or other specified chance of inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">' 
 

65 The selection by the Director of the first 40 services from each of the HIC lists would, on the theses of Professor Nicholls and Dr Stevenson, constitute random samples themselves of the total number of services of each item under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">However, that selection was not itself 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">To say otherwise is to fly in the face of the dictionary meaning of the word 'random' referred to at [64], supra, and to read the phrase 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample' as if the word 'randomly' had no work to do; or to read the phrase as if the word 'randomly' was not there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">66 The same observations can be made of the examination by the Committee of the first 30 (record available) services of each list of the first 40 services from each of the HIC lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">They may also be random samples as sub-sets of sub-sets of random samples (the preliminary random samples) but they do not qualify as being 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Indeed, on the evidence, the Committee never had before it the preliminary random sample of each item of service under review, that is, the HIC lists, from which to randomly draw the exploratory samples; it only ever had before it the first 40 services in those lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">67 The question which arises is whether this error invalidates the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report, namely, that the conduct of Dr Mathews in connection with rendering MBS Item 23, 24 and 193 services that were the subject of Adjudicative Referral 223 was, in the Committee's opinion, unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners and constituted inappropriate practice as defined in s 82 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">In my view it does and for the following reasons:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The importance of complying with the sampling methodology in the Sampling Determination is borne out by all the provisions of s 106K of the Act, but in particular the deeming operation of subs 106K(2) and the fact that the Committee is, by subs 106K(4), prohibited from using a sampling methodology that is not specified in a determination made under subs 106K(3), unless it is ordered by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia that the sampling methodology is statistically valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">The opening words of s 8 of the Sampling Determination make it clear that its requirements are mandatory: 'In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, the majority rejected (at 389 --- 391, [92] --- [93]) the traditional distinction between 'mandatory' and 'directory' requirements, saying that: '[a] better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">In determining the purpose of the legislation, regard has to be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Nevertheless, having regard to the mandatory terms of s 8 of the Sampling Determination and its importance in the process of statistical sampling upon which the Committee's finding is ultimately made, I am of the view that it is a purpose of the Sampling Determination that a finding made in reliance on an act done in breach of s 8 of the Sampling Determination is an invalid finding: See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 per McHugh J at [72] --- [73]; per Hayne J at [205].</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">

68 Paragraph (j) contains the fifth allegation of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It is said that the Committee examined 30 services in each MBS item of service under review from a list of 40 services provided to the Committee by the Director and that the examined services had already been examined by the Director or by servants, officers or agents on his behalf and had been found to be deficient or sufficiently deficient in relevant respects and adverse to Dr Mathews such as to cause the Director to set up a Committee and refer the matter to it by way of Adjudicative Referral pursuant to s 93 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It follows, it is said, that the purported 'exploratory sample' in the hands of the Committee could no longer be considered (if it ever was) a sample 'randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample' within the meaning of s 8 of the Sampling Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">69 In view of my finding in relation to the fourth allegation of error, it is unnecessary to reach a concluded view on this allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Counsel for Dr Mathews put his case on this fifth allegation of error as being 'where fairness meets statistics'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Whether or not the Director's prior examination of the first 30 (record available) services on the list of 40 services provided by the Director to the Committee does lead to the result contended for, namely, non-compliance with the requirements of s 8(a) of the Sampling Determination, it is clear, in my view, that had the Committee undertaken its task according to the terms of s 8(a) of the Sampling Determination and randomly drawn, from the preliminary random sample, 30 services of each item of service under review, the likelihood of all 30 services of each item of service under review being a service which the Director had already examined is negligible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">That, of itself, might suggest that this fifth allegation of error in the sampling process should be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Ground 10 
 
70 Ground 10 is as follows:
 
 
 '10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The making of [the Committee's] Report involved a jurisdictional error or error of law in that [the Committee's] incorrectly interpreted and applied the meaning or definition of the expression "inappropriate practice" in section 82 of the Act and asked itself the wrong question in that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) [The Committee] adopted and applied a particular test or definition of "inappropriate practice" that did not exist for the majority of the referral period under consideration (1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999) (Report paragraphs 38-39).</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) That test was in relevantly identical terms to the tests provided for "an adequate record" in regulation 5 of the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review) Regulations 1999 ("the Regulations ") which did not commence operation until 1 November 1999 (Regulation 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) The Regulations were supported by sub-section 82(3) and the definition of the expression "adequate and contemporaneous records" contained in section 81(1) of the Act, each of which did not commence operation until 1 November 1999 (by section 2(2) of the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999 (Cth) (Act No 95 of 1999).</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) Accordingly, [the Committee] incorrectly and impermissibly adopted, in terms, and applied a statutory test and standard that did not exist in respect of 10 calendar months of the 12 month referral period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) The application of this statutory test pervaded the entire Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">' 
 
 
 
 

71 The basis of this ground is that the Committee applied the wrong test of the expression 'inappropriate practice' in s 82 of the Act by having regard to the adequacy of medical records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">At [38] of the Final Report, the Committee wrote:
 
 'While record keeping is not an explicit requirement for payment of Medicare benefits under the Act or the tables of medical and like benefits, it is the Committee's opinion that the general body of general practitioners would expect a medical record to clearly identify the name of the patient, contain a separate entry with a date for each attendance by the patient, provide clinical information adequate to explain the type of service rendered, and be sufficiently comprehensible for another practitioner, relying on the record to effectively undertake the patient's on-going care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">' (Footnotes omitted)
 

72 For Dr Mathews it is submitted that this statement is in 'relevantly identical' terms to the test provided for 'inadequate record' in reg 5 of the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review) Regulations 1999 ('the Regulations') which did not commence operation until 1 November 1999 (reg 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The Regulations were, in turn, supported by subs 82(3) and the definition of the expression 'adequate and contemporaneous records' contained in subs 81(1) of the Act, each of which did not commence operation until 1 November 1999 (by subs 2(2) of the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999 (Cth) (Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">95 of 1999).</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">73 For Dr Mathews it is said that the Regulations and the applicable test therefore did not exist for the majority of the referral period that was under consideration by the Committee (1 January 1999 --- 31 December 1999) and that the Committee accepted this fact in [60] of the Final Report where it wrote:
 
 'Since 1 November 1999, the legislation has explicitly required committees to have regard to the adequacy of medical records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">' 
 
 

It follows, so the submission went, that the Committee incorrectly and impermissibly adopted, in terms, and applied a statutory test and standard that did not exist with respect to ten calendar months of the 12 month referral period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">As the application of this statutory test pervaded and infected the entire Final Report, the Final Report is accordingly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">74 For the respondents it is submitted that 'inappropriate practice' is defined in s 82(1) of the Act relevantly as 'conduct ... such that a Committee could reasonably conclude that ... the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The Committee addressed itself to the correct test --- [36] of the Final Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">It 'applied its combined professional expertise' --- [37] of the Final Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">As an expert body, it was entitled and expected to do so: Tankey v Adams [2000] FCA 1089 ; (2000) 104 FCR 152 at [107] ; Minister for Health v Thomson (1985) 8 FCR 213 at 217 and 224.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">75 It is further submitted that at the time when Dr Mathews rendered all of the referred services, the keeping of records is recognised as an activity which properly forms part of a professional attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">All three of the MBS item services examined by the Committee were 'professional attendance' items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">'Professional attendance' was defined in the relevant general medical services tables in the following terms:
 
 '4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Meaning of professional attendance in certain terms
 
 
 
 In items 1 to 172, 193 to 338, 348 to 388, 601, 602, 697, 698 and 10900 to 10929, professional attendance includes (but is not limited to) the provision in relation to a patient of 1, or more than 1, of the following services: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the evaluation of the patient's condition or conditions including, if applicable, evaluation using the health screening services mentioned in subsection 19(5) of the Act; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the formulation of a plan for the management and, if applicable, for the treatment of the patient's condition or conditions; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the provision of advice to the patient about the patient's condition or conditions and, if applicable, about treatment; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if authorised by the patient, the provision of advice to another person, or other persons, about the patient's condition or conditions and, if applicable, about treatment; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) the recording of clinical details of the service or services provided to the patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">' 
 
 
 
 

76 Counsel for the respondents acknowledged that the definition of 'inappropriate practice' in s 82 was amended with effect from 1 November 1999 to incorporate a specific reference to record keeping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">She also acknowledged that subs 82(3) relevantly required the Committee to have regard to '... whether or not the practitioner kept adequate and contemporaneous records of the rendering ... of services'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">She further acknowledged that the new provision applied to the services rendered by Dr Mathews during the last two months of the referral period and that a definition of 'adequate and contemporaneous records' was also inserted with the same commencement date --- s 81.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">77 On the other hand, counsel for the respondents submitted that, while the Committee acknowledged that 'record keeping is not an explicit requirement for payment of Medicare benefits', it expressed an opinion that the general body of general practitioners would have certain expectations --- which it particularlised, about medical records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">As an expert body, the Committee was entitled to form the opinion it expressed in [38] of the Final Report extracted in [71], supra, and to give effect to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">78 I agree with the submissions of counsel for the respondents that the Committee treated the deficiencies which it found in Dr Mathews' records as one only of the relevant factors which it took into account when making findings of inappropriate practice in respect of each of the three MBS item services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">It did indeed treat adequate record keeping as a component of the clinical input necessary for proper treatment of the patient and that approach is consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97 at [82] where Tamberlin J said:
 
 'It is evident from the language of the Final Report that the Committee did not treat the failure to keep records, for example, in itself sufficient justification to arrive at its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Rather, the Committee took this into account as a relevant factor and in my opinion, it was entitled to adopt this approach and to enquire into this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">' 
 
 

I agree with his Honour's approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">79 For the foregoing reasons, this ground of appeal cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">CONCLUSION 
 
80 It follows from the foregoing that the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report is invalid because it is predicated upon the Committee's failure to observe the sampling methodology of the Sampling Determination, in particular, the provisions of s 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In the circumstances, the appropriate declaration and orders are that:
 
 1.</sentence>
