 INTRODUCTION 
 This is an application for a determination of native title in respect of an area of approximately 143.9 hectares ('the claim area') comprising various allotments in the locality of the town of Elliott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application was filed with the Court on 6 July 2001 and registered with the National Native Title Tribunal ('the NNTT') on 3 August 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Leave was granted to the applicants to amend the application by this Court on 25 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The amended application was accepted for registration by the Registrar of the NNTT on 17 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A further amendment to the application was made on 4 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The parties to the application have reached agreement about the existence of native title and about the nature and extent of those native title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">They now ask the Court to make an order in the terms that they have agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The order sought gives recognition to a native title claim group comprising fifteen Mudburra or Jingili or mixed Mudburra/Jingili estate groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The primary estate group is the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) estate group who, in accordance with traditional law and custom are recognised to have exclusive and non-exclusive native title rights and interests within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The other fourteen neighbouring estate group members and their spouses, in accordance with their and the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) estate group's traditional law and custom are also recognised to have exclusive and non-exclusive native title rights and interests within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">These fourteen estate groups are described in the following way: The Marlinja (Collins) group; The [Y]Ijiparta (Kingston) group; The Warranangku (Beetaloo) group; The Kulaja (North Waterhole) group; The Powell Creek (Walanpiri) group; The Ngapurr (Nellis Waterhole) group; The North Western group; The Murranji (Narlwan/Nyirrinji) group; The Tururrutpa (Hidden Valley) group; The Powell Creel (Japurla-japurla/Yapa-yapa/Mali-mali) group; The Top Springs (Yingawunarri) group; The Badpa (Daly Waters) group; The Bamarrnganja (Walanja) group; and The Kinbininggu (Peter's Hole), Abie Thomas and Major Taylor group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In support of the orders sought the parties have filed their minute of proposed orders, joint submissions in support of the minute, and a statement of agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In addition to this material the Applicants have filed a number of supporting documents, including two anthropological reports by Mr. Robert Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 THE CLAIM AREA 
 The area for which the determination is sought is, as mentioned above, various allotments in the locality of the town of Elliott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The determination area is part of Mudburra-Jingili country lying to the south and east of the determination area recognised in the matter of King v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCA 944.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">(Hereafter referred to as the Newcastle Waters matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">) The proximity of the determination area to that of Newcastle Waters is relevant to this proceeding as the Applicants are the same estate groups recognised as Native Title Holders by the Newcastle Waters Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Schedule A of the parties minute of proposed orders describes the determination area by reference to lot and portion numbers and an accompanying map (referred to as schedule B) clearly identifies the location of all parcels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The parties' joint submission informs the Court that section 47 B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) have been met in relation to a number of the parcels, with the effect that any prior extinguishment of native title over these parcels can now be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">WHETHER THE PROPOSED CONSENT DETERMINATION SHOULD BE MADE 
 Section 87 of the Act sets out the Court's power to make orders sought by consent of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That section requires the period of notice under s 66 of the Act to have elapsed, that a signed copy of the agreed orders has been filed with the Court, and that the Court is satisfied that the orders are within its power and appropriate to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In this application the period of notice under s 66 of the Act expired on 16 January 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">A written agreement, signed by the parties, relating to the whole of the application area was filed on 15 July 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It remains for the Court to be satisfied that the orders sought are within power and are appropriate to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the Court can, and should, make an order in the terms the parties seek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The material before the Court in support of the application informs the Court of the history of the application and the process that the parties engaged in to reach the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The joint submission explains the agreement and informs the Court that the peoples who comprise the fifteen estate groups relationship with the land is governed by a body of laws and customs which are expressed through spiritual, religious and physical associations, and through descent and processes of succession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">This material supports the finding that the peoples have native title in the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That native title is regulated by the law and custom of the groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The material speaks in support of this and the observance of it is reflected in the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In relation to that part of the determination area where native title rights and interests are to be recognised to the exclusion of all others, the rights and interests are to be held by members of all of the fifteen estate groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In relation to those parts of the determination area where non-exclusive native title rights and interests are to be recognised, the determination sought differentiates between the primary rights of the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) estate group members and the secondary rights and interests of the other fourteen estate groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 Is it appropriate to make the orders?</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 The discretion conferred by s 87(1) of the Act must be exercised judicially, and in exercising it, the Court must have regard to the object and purposes of the Act, one of the most important being the resolution of disputes by negotiation and agreement, rather than litigation Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v State of Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62 at [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The words of the section make it clear that the question for the Court is whether it is appropriate to make an order in the terms of the agreement reached between the parties, with the central focus of the section being the existence of an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Satisfying the Court that it is appropriate for an order to be made should not be seen as the last hurdle to be overcome before the parties reach their ultimate goal of a consent determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Instead s 87 should be regarded as the opportunity for the Court to recognise the parties' success in reaching the ultimate goal of a negotiated agreement, and facilitating that agreement by making an appropriate determination in accordance with its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As North J said in Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474 at [61] : 
 
 " ... when the Court is examining the appropriateness of an agreement, it is not required to examine whether the agreement is grounded on a factual basis which would satisfy the Court at a hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The primary consideration of the Court is to determine whether there is an agreement and whether it was freely entered into on an informed basis...." 
 
 In Munn v Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 Emmett J observed that the Court's deliberations on an application under s 87: 
 "... would include a consideration of the extent to which the State is a party, on the basis that the State, or at least a Minister of State, appears in the capacity of parens patriae to look after the interests of the community generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The mere fact that the State was a party may not be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Court may need to be satisfied that the State has in fact taken a real interest in the proceeding in the interests of the community generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">That may involve the Court being satisfied that the State has given appropriate consideration to the evidence that has been adduced, or intended to be adduced, in order to reach the compromise that is proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Court, in my view, needs to be satisfied at least that the State, through competent legal representation, is satisfied as to the cogency of the evidence upon which the applicants rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">" 
 
 The terms of the agreement between the parties are in writing, the agreement is signed by or on behalf of the parties and the agreement is filed with the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The parties have had the benefit of independent and competent legal representation in arriving at this agreement, the terms of the order are clear and the agreement has been produced as a result of a process of negotiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In this matter the Northern Territory is the sole respondent party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It is clear on the evidence before me that it has taken a real and significant interest in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Before the proposed consent orders were signed the Northern Territory had Emeritus Professor Sansom, who had also been the expert anthropologist for the Northern Territory in the Newcastle Waters matter, consider the anthropological material going to the existence of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Professor Sansom's queries in relation to the material initially provided in this matter were subsequently answered to his satisfaction by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Furthermore, the Northern Territory Cabinet considered the proposed consent orders and instructed the Solicitor for the Northern Territory to agree to the proposed consent determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I am therefore satisfied that the interests of the community generally have been properly considered by the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There can be no doubt about the jurisdiction of the Court to make the orders sought (see s 81 of the Act) and there is nothing in the agreed terms that would suggest that the power of the Court would be exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The proposed order set out details of each of the matters mentioned in s 225 thus satisfying the requirements of s 94A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I am therefore satisfied that it is appropriate that the Court make the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">PRESCRIBED BODY CORPORATE 
 The parties have not nominated a corporation to be the prescribed body corporate, however provision has been made in the orders for an Aboriginal corporation to be nominated within 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">CONCLUSION 
 Finally, I wish to make some remarks about the process by which the proposed consent determination has come about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Because of a long history with the Northern Territory land claims process and native title claims, the legal practitioners employed with both the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council are generally very experienced and competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The legal practitioners employed to deal with land claims and native title claims in the Northern Territory government are similarly experienced and competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Moreover from my experience with the native title list in the Northern Territory, all of the legal practitioners involved appear to be willing to progress the matters in the list, as quickly and efficiently as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is, however, a large number of outstanding native title applications in the Northern Territory native title list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Court and the parties are presented with a considerable challenge - to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately in accordance with the provisions of the Act, but in an efficient and timely manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">To that end, and with the support generally of the parties, the Court adopted a strategy of hearing selected cases to determine particular issues of principle, or perhaps more accurately, issues which relate to the decided case and to a number of others with similar geographical, cultural, social or legal characteristics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">That process has now been completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It was and continues to be my expectation that, as a result of those cases having been decided and the commitment of the parties in 2008 to finalise all matters in the Northern Territory native title list by 2013, most of the outstanding applications will be progressively resolved by a series of consent determinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">I therefore hope this is the first of many consent determinations that the Court will be making in the Northern Territory as a result of this strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I congratulate the parties to the agreement, in so doing I congratulate the native title holders whose rights are now recognised over two areas of land and waters within the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I am encouraged by this determination and encourage the parties to continue with their active engagement in the resolution of native title cases by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I now make the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Reeves.</sentence>
