1 This morning, after hearing the submissions of counsel for the appellant and some brief submissions from counsel for the first respondent to which counsel for the appellant had an opportunity to reply, the Court informed the parties that it did not wish to hear further from counsel for the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Court ordered that the appeal be dismissed with costs and said that it would publish its reasons at 2.30 pm today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">What follows are my reasons for the making of those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The appellant, Jia Da Shen, is aggrieved by the decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to cancel his student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He applied to the Migration Review Tribunal for a merits review of the decision but the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant then sought judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal but the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He now appeals to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The main issues for determination in the appeal are:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Did the Tribunal ask itself the wrong question in deciding a factual matter adversely to the appellant concerning his attendance during contact hours at school?</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Was the Tribunal able to rely on grounds for cancellation other than the one originally identified to the appellant by the Minster's delegate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Was the validity of the cancellation affected by technical problems with the notice sent to him under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Was the appellant denied natural justice?</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 Background 
 
4 The appellant is a citizen of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He came to Australia in August 2001 as the holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) Visa, subclass 560.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The visa had an expiry date of 15 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 The appellant enrolled in a course of secondary education at Eltham College for the academic years 2002 and 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 Semester 1 in 2003 commenced on 3 February 2003 and concluded on 27 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 On 4 June 2003, Eltham College sent the appellant a notice under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The s 20 notice advised the appellant, amongst other things, that he had breached a condition of his student visa relating to course attendance requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 In response to the s 20 notice, the appellant attended the office of the respondent Minister's department in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne on 23 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On that day, a departmental officer handed him a " Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation " under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 The s 116 notice under the heading "possible grounds for cancellation" stated that:
 
 "You have been reported by Eltham College on 4/6/03 that you have been absent for 19 out of 43 classes for maths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Absent for SAC on 29/5/03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Absent for Further Methods for 26 out of 46 classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Has not submitted 4 assessment tasks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">ESL --- absent for 6 lessons and 30 minutes late on 2 occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Physics --- missed at least 4 lessons and absent for Physics SAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Possible breach of 8202 condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 

10 The reference to "8202 condition" was one to condition 8202 to the student visa, referred to at r 2.43(2)(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">At the material time condition 8202 relevantly provided:
 
 (1) The holder...must meet the requirements of subclasses (2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of his subclause if: 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (b) in the case of the holder of Subclass 560 ... visa who is an exchange student - the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study... 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">A holder meets the requirements of his subclause if: 
 
 
 
 (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records --- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term and semester of the course; and 
 (b) in any case --- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 ..." 

11 On 3 October 2003, an officer of the department provided the appellant with a further s 116 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The second notice stated:
 
 "Visa holder has been previously notified of an intention to consider cancelling his visa on 23/6/03 for a breach of visa condition 8202 due to poor attendance at Eltham College.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The notification is still valid but non-enrolment has also been added for the client as he has no current enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Breach of visa condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">" 

12 Earlier in June 2003, Eltham College had notified the department that the appellant was not enrolled at the College as at 11 June 2003, as the appellant had left school on 10 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">13 After interviewing the appellant on 3 October 2003, the delegate cancelled the visa under s 116(1)(b) and (3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Under those provisions, the Minister may cancel a visa if the holder has not complied with a condition of it and must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">14 The delegate found that:
 
 &#8226; the appellant breached condition 8202(3)(a)(ii) by attending less that 80% of scheduled contact hours in Semester 1 of 2003; and
 &#8226; The appellant breached condition 8202(2)(b) by not being enrolled in a full time course of study in Semester 2 of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

15 On 6 October 2003, the appellant sought a review of the delegate's decision in the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">On 22 March 2004, the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal's decision 
 
16 The Tribunal noted that the delegate calculated the appellant's attendance at his classes in Semester 1 of 2003 at 75%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It also noted that the appellant left school on 10 June 2003 to transfer to another course due to commence on 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It further observed that, on his own evidence, the appellant either did not enrol in that other course or had enrolled but did not pay fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">17 Before the Tribunal the appellant took issue with the accuracy of the attendance records provided by Eltham College.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal found that it had "no reason to believe that the attendance records provided by Eltham College are other than an accurate record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">" It considered that the appellant had not met condition 8203(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It also said that condition 8203(3)(b) had not been met as the College had not certified that the appellant had achieved a satisfactory academic result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Further, it found that the appellant had breached condition 8202(2) by not being engaged in full time study at any institution between 11 June 2003 and the cancellation of his visa on 3 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Federal Magistrate's Judgment 
 
18 Federal Magistrate Phipps dismissed the application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision on 10 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">His Honour noted that the appellant had raised two main issues before him:
 
 1. the Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant had attended 80% of contact hours but rather looked at daily attendance records, thereby asking itself the wrong question; and
 2. the Tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not making its own inquiries about the attendance records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

19 On the first issue, Phipps FM, referred to the judgment of Jacobson J in Quan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 764.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In Quan , the Court held that the Tribunal had asked itself the wrong question by not considering "whether it had reached a state of satisfaction as to the contact hours attended"; see Quan at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">20 In Quan the attendance records related to only the total number of days at which Mr Quan attended at the school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">They bore no relation to what actually occurred during his attendance at school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">21 The Federal Magistrate observed that the records from Eltham College were class attendance records and not daily attendance records as in Quan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">At [14], his Honour said:
 
 "The reasonable reading of them is that the tribunal considered that when the College records and other material showed that the [appellant] was absent from a class, that meant he missed the class, not that he was there for part of the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Therefore, to calculate a percentage of classes attended was to calculate a percentage of contact hours attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">" 

22 His Honour then noted the appellant's submission that the Tribunal had not taken into account other activities at the College in assessing attendance, such as School Assessed Coursework.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">His Honour said that the Tribunal had evidence before it about attendance and determined, on that evidence, that the required percentage of contact hours was not attained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Therefore, he considered that the Tribunal did not ask itself the wrong question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">23 The Federal Magistrate also dismissed the appellant's submissions based on natural justice and related grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He said that the Tribunal was not obliged to search for evidence on the College's practice of recording lateness for class or the way attendance on medical practitioners affected attendance records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">24 His Honour found, in any event, that the Tribunal had independent valid grounds for affirming the cancellation of the visa given the lack of certification of a satisfactory academic result and the failure of the appellant to be enrolled in full time study from 11 June 2003 until the cancellation of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The competing submissions 
 
25 Counsel for the appellant took issue with his Honour's distinguishing of Quan .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Counsel also said that the Tribunal was not able to rely on a breach of condition 8202(2)(b), or the condition relating to satisfactory academic performance, given that the s 20 notice only referred to attendance requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Counsel contended that reliance on these conditions by the Tribunal amounted to a denial of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In his oral submissions, counsel contended that the Tribunal's reliance on the condition relating to satisfactory academic performance amounted to a breach of s 359A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Counsel also submitted that the Tribunal erred by considering whether the applicant was engaged in full time study, and not whether he was enrolled in a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Counsel further submitted that the Tribunal erred by disregarding the effect of the alleged statement of the delegate that the applicant was not permitted to study in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">26 Counsel for the Minister submitted that "contact hours" in condition 8202 refers to the proportion of required contact hours attended by the student.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He said that there was no suggestion before the Tribunal that the length of classes varied from subject to subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Counsel also agreed with the Court below that Quan was distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Counsel stated in his written outline of submissions that Quan :
 
 "...was a case in which there was no inquiry made as to the number of classes attended, and the decision rested on a simplistic calculation based on the number of days the visa holder had not attended school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">" 

27 Counsel for the Minister calculated from the attendance records before the Tribunal that "expressed as a proportion of the total number of classes the appellant was required to attend in term 1, [of 2003] his attendance was less that the required 80%".</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Counsel also contended that there was no basis for the submission of the appellant that the attendance records did not properly reflect when he was late, as distinct from absent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Counsel drew attention to the appellant's failure to persuade the Tribunal that he had been marked as absent on two occasions when he had merely been late.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">28 Counsel for the Minister submitted that the s 20 notice did not act as precondition to the cancellation under s 116.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He also contended that the appellant could not have been taken by surprise by the findings that he was not enrolled in course of study and was not the beneficiary of certificate of satisfactory completion of study as each matter was an incontrovertible fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Further, counsel disputed that the delegate of the Minister told the appellant that he was not permitted to study
 The attendance issue 
 
29 Regulation 1.03 of the Migration Regulations defines "contact hours" as:
 
 "for a course for a period, means the total number of hours in the period for which students enrolled in the course are scheduled to attend classes for teaching purposes, course-related information sessions, supervised study sessions and examinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">" 

30 The records relied on by the Tribunal were attendance records for classes, school assessed coursework and examinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Those records enabled an assessment of "contact hours" within the definition of those words in the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal's calculation of the contact hours attended by the appellant was a question of fact for it to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Unlike in Quan , the Tribunal did consider whether it had reached a state of satisfaction as to contact hours attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It did not merely consider the total number of days attended as a proportion of the number of days in the term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">No judicially reviewable error arose as a result of the Tribunal's treatment of this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The section 20 issue --- jurisdictional error/ natural justice 
 
31 The Tribunal was entitled to consider the appellant's failure to be enrolled in full time study and his failure to achieve satisfactory academic results as grounds for visa cancellation, despite the s 20 notice not referring to these grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">32 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 it was held, by majority, that s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act does not limit the circumstances in which s 116 of the Migration Act might operate where condition 8202 has not been complied with by a visa holder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">33 Consequently there was nothing stopping the Tribunal from relying on grounds other than the attendance record ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">No breach of natural justice arose as a consequence because the facts giving rise to these breaches of condition 8202 were obvious and incontrovertible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">This is especially so where, as here, s 357A applied to the application for review such that general procedural fairness grounds of review were not open to the appellant in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Any allegation that s 359A of the Act was not complied with by the Tribunal, due to an alleged failure to raise with the appellant the College's lack of certification of satisfactory completion of his course, is met by the fact that the Tribunal had two other independent grounds for cancelling the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">See, by way of analogy in respect of s 424A, SZEEU v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [160] per Weinberg J and [233] per Allsop J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In other words, the failure of the Tribunal to inform the appellant that the visa could be cancelled as a consequence of a lack of certification of successful completion of his course did not affect the outcome of the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Furthermore, the lack of certification was something so obvious that it need not have been stated and was a vital requirement for satisfaction of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">34 The appeal ground relating to the Tribunal's consideration of whether the applicant was engaged in study, rather than whether he was enrolled in a course, was not developed further in oral submissions before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The contention of the appellant that he was not so enrolled because the delegate allegedly told him not to enrol does not deny the fact of his non-enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In any event, this ground is, again, independent of the other grounds for cancellation of the visa, that is, failure to achieve satisfactory academic results and failure to meet the attendance requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Morsed - section 20 notice problems 
 
35 As the s 20 notices in this matter suffered from the vices detected in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193 , I invited the parties to present written submissions dealing with that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">36 In Morsed , the appellant claimed that his breach of condition 8202 was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">No such issue of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant is relevant here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">On that view alone, Morsed is distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">37 In any event, the cancellation of the student visa in Morsed arose as a result of the automatic effect of s 137J of the Migration Act , consequent upon a s 20 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It did not arise, as here, by virtue of the independent operation of s 116 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Order 
 
38 Having regard to the foregoing I dismissed the appeal, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 
 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
