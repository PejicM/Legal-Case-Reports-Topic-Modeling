 BACKGROUND 
 This is an application under articles 15, 17 and 21 of Schedule 1 of the Cross-Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) ("the Act") for a foreign proceeding to be recognised in Australia and for final orders to preserve the defendant's property in this jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The defendant ("Samsun") is a company incorporated in South Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It caries on the business of providing, inter alia , ocean freight forwarding services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 6 March 2009, the Seoul Central District Court, 3rd Bankruptcy Division, Korea made an order on the application of Samsun that its petition to commence rehabilitation proceedings be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Korean court appointed the plaintiff ("Mr Hur") as the receiver of Samsun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The nature of the order of the Korean court is more akin to the effect of Chapter 11 of the United States' bankruptcy laws, rather than an order under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for the administration of a company's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">This application was filed on 13 March 2009 when the matter came on for urgent interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On that date, Stone J made orders that pending the final hearing or further order, no person may enforce a charge on the property of Samsun and certain other orders pursuant to articles 19 and 21 of Schedule 1 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The hearing today is the final hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The orders made by Stone J provided for advertisements to be published in accordance with rule 15A.6 of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I have evidence before me that those orders were satisfied and there is evidence that none of the known creditors of Samsun within this jurisdiction wish to be heard today on the final hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The principal matter which arises is dealt with in article 17 of Schedule 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Korean proceeding is to be recognised if it is a foreign proceeding in accordance with the definition contained in article 2 of Schedule 1 and if Mr Hur is a person who was appointed in the Korean proceeding to administer the re-organisation of Samsun's assets or affairs or to act as a representative in the foreign proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">LEGISLATION 
 I will, for convenience, set out the relevant provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Section 5(1) defines Model Law to mean the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, set out in the Annex to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/Res/52/158, the English text of which is set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Section 6 of the Act is as follows: 
 Subject to this Act, the Model Law, with the modifications set out in this Part, has the force of law in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 Section 7(1) provides as follows: 
 In the Model Law (as it has the force of law in Australia), a reference to this State is a reference to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 Section 8 provides that: 
 The Model Law has the force of law in Australia as if the Model Law referred to:
 (a) the Bankruptcy Act 1966 ; and
 (b) Chapter 5 (other than Parts 5.2 and 5.4A ), and section 601CL , of the Corporations Act 2001 ;
 wherever the Model Law provides that the laws of the enacting State relating to insolvency are to be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 Section 10(b)(1) confers jurisdiction on this court in the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Section 13 provides as follows: 
 In addition to the requirement in paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the Model Law (as it has the force of law in Australia) that an application for recognition be accompanied by a statement identifying all foreign proceedings in respect of the debtor that are known to the foreign representative, the application must be accompanied by a statement identifying:
 (a) all proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in respect of the debtor; and
 (b) any appointment of a receiver (within the meaning of section 416 of the Corporations Act 2001 ), or a controller or a managing controller (both within the meaning of section 9 of that Act), in relation to the property of the debtor; and
 (c) all proceedings under Chapter 5, or section 601CL , of the Corporations Act 2001 in respect of the debtor;
 that are known to the foreign representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

 Section 16 states: 
 For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 20 of the Model Law (as it has the force of law in Australia), the scope and the modification or termination of the stay or suspension referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article, are the same as would apply if the stay or suspension arose under:
 (a) the Bankruptcy Act 1966 ; or
 (b) Chapter 5 (other than Parts 5.2 and 5.4A ) of the Corporations Act 2001 ;
 as the case requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">

 
The effect of that section appears to be that the stay is to be to the same extent and effect as under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) or the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Article 2 of Schedule 1 sets out the definitions which apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The relevant definitions are set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) as follows: 
 (a) "Foreign proceeding" means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign State, including an interim proceeding, pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation;
 (b) "Foreign main proceeding" means a foreign proceeding taking place in the State where the debtor has the centre of its main interests;
 ...
 (d) "Foreign representative" means a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis, authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the debtor's assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding 
 Article 4 provides, in effect, that this Court has the relevant jurisdiction and is a competent court to make the orders which are sought.</sentence>

 Article 20.</sentence>

 The Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 have recently been amended to deal in rule 15A.3 with applications for recognition of a foreign proceeding under article 15 of the Model Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There is also a practice note dealing with these applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The practice note is Practice Note No 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">THE APPLICATION 
 The application was supported by an affidavit of Mr J.K. Marshall, who is a partner in the firm of solicitors for both Mr Hur and Samsun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I am satisfied that Mr Marshall's affidavit provides the necessary evidence to satisfy the requirements of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In particular, I am satisfied that under article 17(1), the Korean proceeding is a foreign proceeding within the meaning of article 2(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It may not be entirely clear as to what is meant by a "collective" judicial proceeding, but I do not think that anything turns on that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">What is important is that the Korean proceeding is a proceeding relating to insolvency in which the assets and affairs of Samsun are subject to the supervision of the Korean Court for the purpose of the re-organisation of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This is made clear by the terms of the order of the Korean Court dated 6 March 2009 and the reasons for the decision of that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I am also satisfied that Mr Hur is a foreign representative who is entitled to make this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is because Mr Hur is a foreign representative within article 2(d) because he is the person who has been appointed as the receiver of Samsun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Mr Hur is an officer of Samsun and this demonstrates the analogy of the orders to Chapter 11 of the American bankruptcy laws rather than to an order under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I am therefore satisfied that Mr Hur is a person who is applying for recognition in accordance with article 17(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I am also satisfied that the application meets the requirements of paragraph 2 of article 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This is because Mr Marshall has annexed to his affidavit a certified copy of the decision of the Korean court commencing the foreign proceeding and appointing Mr Hur as the foreign representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">I am also satisfied that the provisions of article 17(1)(d) apply because the application is made to this Court as a court of competent jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In addition, I am satisfied that the Korean proceedings should be recognised as a foreign main proceeding because it is taking place in the State where Samsun has the centre of its main interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Article 16, paragraph 3 is set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">There is evidence in the affidavit of Mr Marshall that Samsun's registered office is at the Ima Building, 146-1 Susong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Accordingly, the effect of article 17, paragraph 2(a) is that the proceedings be recognised as a foreign-main proceeding because it is taking place in South Korea where Samsun has the centre of its main interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">There are a number of other procedural provisions which are required to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">These are set out in section 13 of the Act and article 15, paragraph 3 of the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Mr Marshall's evidence establishes that to the best of his knowledge, there has been no appointment of a receiver within the meaning of section 416 of the Corporations Act , or a controller or a managing controller within the meaning of section 9 of that Act, in relation to the property of Samsun, and there are no other proceedings known to Mr Marshall under chapter 5 or section 601CL of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Marshall is aware that there are applications of a similar nature that have been made in the United States under Chapter 15 of Title 11 of the United States Code , in England under the Insolvency Act 2000 , and in Singapore and Belgium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I have been provided with a minute of the order made by Mr Justice Morgan of the High Court of Justice on 12 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">His Lordship recognised the Korean proceedings as a foreign main proceeding in accordance with the Model Law and made orders under article 20(1) and 21 of the Model Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The proceedings in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Belgium are ancillary to the Korean proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I am satisfied that the provisions of rule 15A.6 for notification of known creditors have been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It seems to me to be appropriate to make orders under article 21, paragraph 1 and I will do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Accordingly, I will make orders in terms of the short minutes of order provided to me by Counsel for the plaintiff which I will sign and date and place with the court papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Associate:
 
 
Dated: 21 April 2009
 
 Counsel for the Plaintiff: P T Russell 
 
 Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Blake Dawson 
 Date of Hearing: 17 April 2009
