 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The Repatriation Commission ("the Commission") appeals under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") made on 24 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The Commission had decided under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ("the VE Act ") that the death of the respondent's husband ("the veteran") was not war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Tribunal set aside the decision of the Tribunal and determined that the death of the veteran was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 For the reasons that follow, the appeal should be allowed and the decision of the Tribunal of 24 October 2006 must be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These reasons are structured as follows:
 
(1) Factual background to the appeal: paras [4] to [8];
 
(2) The legislative framework: paras [9] to [24];
 
(3) The Tribunal's decision: paras [25] to [28];
 
(4) The questions of law: paras [29] to [30];
 
(5) Analysis: paras [31] to [51];
 
(6) Conclusion: paras [52] to [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL 
 
4 Mrs Codd, the applicant, is the widow of Ronald Codd, the veteran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The veteran served in the Australian Army from 5 October 1942 until 9 August 1946.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">All of the veteran's service was operational service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He saw service as a stretcher bearer and was exposed to horrifying events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The veteran's war-caused diseases were chronic eczema, mild labile hypertension and infected tonsils.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 On 7 December 1968, the veteran was killed when a truck driven by him was struck by a train at a level crossing in Benalla, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The post mortem found that the cause of death was " Multiple Injuries including brain damage ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 On 12 December 1968, Mrs Codd was unsuccessful in a claim for a war widow's pension under the Repatriation Act 1920 (Cth) ("the Repatriation Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On 17 July 1985, Mrs Codd made a second claim for a war widow's pension under the Repatriation Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Veterans' Review Board ("the VRB") affirmed the Commission's decision that the death of the veteran was not war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 On 30 March 2001, Mrs Codd made a third claim for a war widow's pension under the Repatriation Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">A delegate of the Commission decided that the veteran's death was not war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 10 October 2002, the VRB affirmed the Commission's decision that the death of the veteran was not war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 19 December 2002, pursuant to s 175 of the VE Act , Mrs Codd applied to the Tribunal for review of the VRB's decision of 10 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On 20 August 2004, the Tribunal decided that the death of the veteran was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 30 June 2005, the Federal Court allowed an appeal by the Commission from the decision of the Tribunal, on the basis that material before the Tribunal could not support the Tribunal's diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder ("GAD") and that if the veteran had been suffering from GAD, the Tribunal had failed to consider whether a hypothesis of connection between that disease and the veteran's operational service was upheld by the relevant Statement of Principles ("SoP"): Repatriation Commission v Codd [2005] FCA 888 at [46] - [47] and [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 On 24 October 2006, the Tribunal decided again, on different grounds, that the death of the veteran was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On 20 November 2006, the Commission appealed from the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is the Tribunal's decision of 24 October 2006 which is the subject of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
9 Section 13(1) of the VE Act renders the Commonwealth liable to pay a pension to the dependents of a veteran whose death was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 8(1) of the VE Act sets out the circumstances in which a veteran's death is taken to be war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">They include if:
 
 
 "(b) the death of the veteran arose out of, or was attributable to , any eligible war service rendered by the veteran; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (d) in the opinion of the Commission, the death of the veteran was due to an accident that would not have occurred, or to a disease that would not have been contracted, but for his or her having rendered eligible war service or but for changes in the veteran's environment consequent upon his or her having rendered eligible war service; ..." 
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">) 
 

10 The standard of proof to be applied in determining whether a veteran's death was war-caused is prescribed by ss 120(1) and (3) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Section 120 of the VE Act relevantly provides:
 
 
 "(1) Where a claim under Part II for a pension in respect of the incapacity from injury or disease of a veteran, or of the death of a veteran, relates to the operational service rendered by the veteran, the Commission shall determine ... that the death of the veteran was war-caused ... unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 ... 
 (3) In applying subsection (1) or (2) ... in respect of the death of a person, related to service rendered by the person, the Commission shall be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for determining: 
 ... 
 (c) that the death was war-caused or defence-caused; 
 
 
 
 
 ... if the Commission, after consideration of the whole of the material before it, is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the ...death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 
 
 
 
 
 
 

11 The threshold question posed by s 120(3) is whether the whole of the material before the decision-maker raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran's death with the circumstances of his service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">If the material does raise such a reasonable hypothesis, the decision-maker proceeds to the question posed by s 120(1) --- namely, is the decision-maker satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts required to connect the veteran's death with his service were disproved or were displaced by other facts: Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564 at 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 As the language of s 120(3) makes clear, and as the High Court emphasised in Repatriation Commission v Owens (1996) 70 ALJR 904 at 904, the question whether a reasonable hypothesis is raised is to be determined on a consideration of the whole of the material before the decision-maker: see also Repatriation Commission v Bey (1997) 79 FCR 364 at 367.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">A reasonable hypothesis within s 120(3) of the VE Act is a hypothesis that is pointed to by the material before the decision-maker, and not merely left open (or not excluded) by that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">A hypothesis that is not pointed to, but is a matter of assertion or is merely left open by the material, is not a reasonable hypothesis: see East v Repatriation Commission (1987) 16 FCR 517 at 532-533.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">See also Repatriation Commission v Bey (1997) 79 FCR 364 at 366-367, 372-373; Bull v Repatriation Commission (2001) 188 ALR 756 at [18] and [41].</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 Section 120(3) "is affected by s 120A" and, according to s 120A(1) , applies to a claim under Part II of the VE Act made on or after 1 June 1994 that relates to operational service rendered by a veteran: ss 120A(1)(a) , 120A (3) and 120A (4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mrs Codd's claim was such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 Section 120A was introduced by the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The intent behind the introduction of s 120A (and s 196B) of the VE Act was explained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill, an extract of which was set out by the Full Court in Woodward v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 160 ; (2003) 131 FCR 473 at 489, [90] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">15 Sections 120A(3) and (4) of the VE Act provide:
 
 
 "(3) For the purposes of subsection 120(3), a hypothesis connecting ... the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(2) or (11); or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a determination of the Commission under subsection 180A(2); 
 
 
 that upholds the hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" 
 
 
 
 (4) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a claim in respect of ... the incapacity from injury or disease, or the death, of a person if the Authority has neither determined a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(2), nor declared that it does not propose to make such a Statement of Principles, in respect of: 
 
 
 (a) the kind of injury suffered by the person; or 
 (b) the kind of disease contracted by the person; or 
 (c) the kind of death met by the person; 
 as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">" 
 

16 Section 120A(3) of the VE Act relevantly provides that a hypothesis connecting the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force a SoP or a determination by the Commission that upholds the hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The second basis (a determination by the Commission) is not relevant to the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">That is, the hypothesis raised (that is, pointed to) by the material will only be reasonable if the hypothesis is consistent with, or fits the template of, a SoP: see Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 96, endorsing the observations of Heerey J at first instance: Deledio v Repatriation Commission (1997) 47 ALD 261 at 275.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">17 It is the function of the Repatriation Medical Authority ("the RMA") to determine SoPs for the purposes of the VE Act : s 196B(1) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Section 196B(2) of the VE Act provides that if the RMA is of the view that there is " sound medical-scientific evidence " that indicates a particular kind of injury, disease or death can be related, inter alia, to operational service then it is for the RMA to determine a SoP in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death setting out the factors that must exist as a minimum and which of those factors must be related to service by the veteran before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting an injury, disease or death of that kind with the circumstances of that service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The phrase " sound medical-scientific evidence " is defined in s 5AB of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">18 Section 120A(4) of the VE Act qualifies s 120A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It relevantly provides that s 120A(3) does not apply in respect of an injury, disease or death if the RMA has not determined a SoP under s 196B(2) nor declared that it does not propose to make such a SoP in respect of the kind of injury suffered by the veteran, the kind of disease contracted by the veteran or the kind of death met by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">19 The method by which ss 120(1) , 120 (3) and 120A (3) are applied was explained in Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 97-98.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Full Court set out the course which the Tribunal is to take in a case such as the present in the following terms:
 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">No question of fact finding arises at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">If the material does raise such a hypothesis, the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s 196B(2) or (11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">If no such SoP is in force, the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and, in consequence, the application must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">If an SoP is in force, the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It will do so if the hypothesis fits, that is to say, is consistent with the 'template' to be found in the SoP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist, and be related to the person's service (as required by ss 196B(2)(d) and (e)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">If the hypothesis does contain these factors, it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts, nor otherwise fanciful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template, it will be deemed not to be 'reasonable' and the claim will fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s 120(1) whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war-caused, or in the case of a claim for incapacity, that the incapacity did not arise from a war-caused injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">If not so satisfied, the claim must succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">If the Tribunal is so satisfied, the claim must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In so doing, no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" 
 
 
 

20 However, the Deledio methodology is subject to at least three important qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">First, the methodology is not to be applied mechanistically or to operate in substitution for the requirements of the VE Act : Hill v Repatriation Commission (2005) 218 ALR 251 at [35] and [85]; Hardman v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCAFC 83 at [32] and Dunlop v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 201 at [33] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">21 Secondly, as was pointed out by the Full Court in Woodward v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 160 ; (2003) 131 FCR 473 at 483 at [55], the observation at step 2 of the Deledio analysis that if no SoP is in force the application must fail, must be qualified by reference to s 120A(4) of the VE Act which provides that s 120A(3) does not apply in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">22 Thirdly, as Selway J said in Repatriation Commission v Hancock (2003) 37 AAR 383 at [11], there are at least two additional steps before step one in the Deledio analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The steps were described by Selway J in Hancock as being:
 
 
 "First, the AAT was required to determine, on balance of probabilities, whether the pre-conditions other than causation, had been made out... 
 
 Next, the AAT was required to determine on balance of probabilities what "kind of death" [the veteran] had suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">This involved the identification, on balance of probabilities, of any and all [SoP] and/or determinations under s 180A(2) of the Act and any other "kinds of death" which were applicable to that death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 If one or more SoP were applicable, then the methodology in Deledio is applicable in relation to those "kinds of death"..." 
 


 
23 In the present matter then, it was necessary:
 
 
 (1) to establish the pre-conditions for the claim other than causation on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">(For example, in the present case, it was necessary for Mrs Codd to show that her husband was a veteran; that Mr Codd had died and that Mrs Codd was a widow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">None of these pre-conditions was in dispute here); and
 (2) in order to ascertain whether a SoP applies, to determine on the balance of probabilities the " kind of death " suffered by the veteran: s 120A(2) and (4) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 

24 It is the second of these additional steps which is the subject of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It will be necessary to return to consider the phrase " kind of death met by the [veteran] " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
25 The Tribunal decided that the death of the veteran was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The hypothesis of connection between the veteran's death and his operational service was articulated by Dr Epstein in the following terms:
 
 
 "[The veteran's] drinking habits were probably war caused and there is a reasonable hypothesis pointing to the effects of alcohol impairing his concentration and contributing to the collision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">" 
 
 

26 The hypothesis was summarised " as the late veteran developing a service related alcohol habit the effects of which impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">" It was that hypothesis the Tribunal accepted as a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran's death with the circumstances of his war-service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">27 The Tribunal declared that the " kind of death " met by the veteran was death by road accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Commission contends that on a proper construction of ss 120 and 120A of the VE Act , the Tribunal's finding that the kind of death met by the veteran was "death by road accident" was not open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">28 As a result of the Tribunal's declaration of the " kind of death " as death by road accident, the Tribunal:
 
 
 (1) found that there was no SoP which applied to that kind of death and proceeded on the basis that the application was to be determined by the law prevailing before the introduction of the regime of SoPs; and
 (2) not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were sufficient grounds to determine that the death was not war-caused, set aside the decision under review and decided that the death was war-caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 
 QUESTIONS OF LAW 
 
29 The Commission contends that the Tribunal's reasons for decision contain two errors of law and therefore, on appeal, raise two questions of law:
 
 
 (1) the proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act;
 (2) even if the Tribunal had properly construed ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act in finding that the kind of death met by the veteran was " death by road accident ", whether the Tribunal erred in failing to determine the application of pension by applying the reasoning of Goldberg J in Repatriation Commission v McKenna (1998) 28 AAR 7 at 15-16 which was endorsed by the Full Court in McKenna v Repatriation Commission [1999] FCA 323 ; (1999) 86 FCR 144 at [20] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">(I will describe this as the " McKenna principle").</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 

30 The respondent contended that the Tribunal's finding of the " kind of death " as death by road accident was a finding of fact which was 'unimpeachable'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">That submission should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">For the reasons that follow, it is apparent that in making that finding, the Tribunal erred in the proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">That is an error of law: Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 394-5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">ANALYSIS 
 
 (1) Proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act 

31 The phrase " kind of death met by the person " in s 120A(4) asks a causative question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It is not a question about whether the death was slow, fast or the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It asks " questions of medical causation" about the cause of death and does so in a particular context --- the VE Act and, in particular, Part VIII of the VE Act : see also Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) pp i-ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">32 The notion of "causing" has been said to be one of common sense: Environment Agency (formerly National Rivers Authority) v Empress Car Co. (Abertillery) Ltd [1998] UKHL 5 ; [1999] 2 AC 22 at 29 (per Lord Hoffman).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">But whatever may be conveyed by the reference to " common sense ", answers to questions of causation will differ according to the purpose for which the question is asked: Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 224 CLR 627 at [45] ; Allianz Australia Insurance Limited v GSF Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 26 ; (2005) 221 CLR 568 at [96] - [97] ; Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55 ; (1998) 195 CLR 232 at [63] - [64] (per Gummow J) and at [122] (per Hayne J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">33 The answer to the question of causation posed by s 120A(4) of the VE Act (the " kind of death met by the person ") requires identification and examination of the purpose for which the question is being asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The purpose or reason for asking the question is not at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The nature and scope of the purpose for asking the question is to be found in the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Under Part VIII of the VE Act , the nature and scope of the purpose or, to put the matter another way, the purpose for which the question in s 120A(4) is being asked, is to be found in s 120A(3) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Since s 120A(4) qualifies s 120A(3) of the VE Act , one identifies the nature and purpose of the causal question in s 120A(4) (the " kind of death met by the person ") by reference to the matters identified in s 120A(3) - a hypothesis connecting a veteran's death with the circumstances of that veteran's service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">34 Putting the same point another way, s 120A(3) regulates the causation enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Subsection 120A(4) qualifies a particular application of that causation enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Therefore, s 120A(4) is to be construed in a way that gives effect to the evident statutory objective of the Part and, in particular, s 120A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">35 What then is the purpose for which the question in s 120A(4) about the kind of death met by the person is being asked?</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">As a matter of statutory construction the answer is that the purpose is to ascertain whether or not there is a SoP which addresses the question of the reasonableness of the hypothesis about the connection between the cause of death of the veteran and the circumstances of the service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">36 The " kind of death met by the [veteran]" that is to be identified requires examination of the causal connection between the death and the circumstances of the service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In particular, it requires examination of the relevant hypothesis that is said to provide the causal link between death and service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In the present case, the hypothesis was that the death was war-caused and that the cause, or at least one of the causes of death, was the veteran's "service related alcohol habit[,] the effects of which [had] impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">37 Section 196B of the VE Act and the SoP the subject of this proceeding provide further support for the view that the " kind of death met by the [veteran] " that is to be identified presents a question about medical causation --- that the kind of death is a medical cause of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Sections 120A and 196B were inserted into the VE Act to address questions of medical causation: see also Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) pp i-ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 120A(3) requires that a claim for pension be measured against a SoP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover, a SoP is not determined unless the RMA is of the view that there is " sound medical-scientific evidence " that indicates that a particular injury, disease or death can be related to inter alia war service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If such a determination is made by the RMA, the SoP sets out the factors that must as a minimum exist and which of those factors must be related to service by the veteran before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting an injury, disease or death of that kind with the circumstances of that service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The phrase " sound medical-scientific evidence " in relation to a particular kind of injury, disease or death is defined in s 5AB of the VE Act by reference to, inter alia , published medical or scientific publications that have been subjected to peer review process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">All of these matters point to the conclusions earlier expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">38 Finally, the SoP which is the subject of this appeal is itself directed to questions of medical causation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">To take just one example, cl 8 of the SoP defines " death from alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse " to include " death from a terminal event or condition that was contributed by the person's alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The phrase " terminal event " is defined to mean " the proximate or ultimate cause of death and includes ...(e) cessation of brain function ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">39 On the proper construction of the VE Act , consistent with its evident statutory purpose and existing authority, the " kind of death met by the [veteran] " that is to be considered is the question of medical causation or the kind of death, being a medical cause of death, including the contributing or underlying medical cause of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">40 In the present case, the kind of death met by the veteran was not death by road accident but death from (in the sense of arose out of, or was attributable to) alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">41 The respondent submitted that the expression " kind of death " was " concerned with the way in which a veteran met his or her death ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">That submission should be rejected for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">First, for the reasons already given, to read the expression in the way suggested by the respondent would be contrary to the scheme of the VE Act and its evident purpose and would be contrary to existing authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Secondly, the suggested construction of the expression conflates several distinct inquiries including the inquiry about the " way in which " a veteran met his death (as to time or place) and the inquiry about the medical cause of this death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">If such an approach were adopted it would circumvent the scheme of the VE Act and in particular, the SoPs determined by the RMA under s 196B of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">As the Commission submitted, on the respondent's approach, death by suicide could be characterised as death by the means employed, the place where the death occurred or by the time of day when the death occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Such a characterisation, if adopted, would permit a veteran to circumvent any SoP which did not uphold the claimant's hypothesis seeking to link the death with war-service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Such an approach should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">42 Despite the respondent's submissions to the contrary, the decision of Tamberlin J in Repatriation Commission v Towns (2003) 38 AAR 77 does not assist the respondent's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The decision must be understood having regard to the matters that were in issue in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">In Towns , there was consensus that there was no relevant SoP and so it was unnecessary to make any analysis of the kind of death met by the veteran: at [28].</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It would be wrong, then, to take what was said in that case as supporting or establishing the general proposition that the expression " kind of death " was not concerned with medical causation where the medical cause or causes can be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Likewise, the decision of Branson J in Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] FCA 914 makes plain that the decision in that case was not the occasion to provide general and definitive guidance about the meaning of the expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">43 It is sufficient, in the present case to say that, for the reasons stated, I consider the Tribunal failed to properly construe ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Tribunal did not ask the correct question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That was an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">(2) Failure to apply McKenna principle 
 
44 Even if I am wrong in my view of the proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act , it is common ground that the Tribunal proceeded to consider the application for pension contrary to the decision of the Full Court in McKenna v Repatriation Commission [1999] FCA 323 ; (1999) 86 FCR 144 at [20] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">45 In McKenna , the Commission had determined that ischaemic heart disease and atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease suffered by Mr McKenna were each a war-caused disease within the VE Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The effect of the decision of Goldberg J at first instance was to reach a contrary conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Goldberg J said (28 AAR 7 at 15):
 
 
 "For the purposes of s 120A(3) of the [VE] Act the hypothesis which has to be upheld by a [SoP] is the hypothesis which connects the disease suffered by a veteran with the circumstances of his service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">So stated, the hypothesis has to point to a connection which starts with the disease in respect of which the application is made and ends with the service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">That connection will comprise a number of links or factors each of which must be upheld by a [SoP] and, if need be, by more than one [SofP].</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the instant case the relevant links are: 
 [diseases listed] 
 When the hypothesis is identified this way it is then necessary, consistently with the course identified by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio , to ask and answer the question in accordance with s 120A(3)(a) of the Act --- is there in force a SoP that upholds the hypothesis, that is to say the hypothesis connecting each of the diseases contracted by the respondent with the circumstances of his operational service?</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">It is therefore necessary to identify whether there is in force a [SoP] which upholds the whole, and not just part, of this hypothesis..".</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">
 

46 The Full Court endorsed the approach of Goldberg J and said at [20]:
 
 "Since the Authority had determined [SoP] in respect of the kinds of diseases suffered by Mr McKenna (s 120A(4)(b)), the next step which the Tribunal was required to take was to form an opinion whether the hypotheses pointed to by the material before the Tribunal were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">It was only entitled to form the opinion that they were reasonable if they were upheld by, in the sense of consistent with, the relevant [SoP].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In our view, for either of the hypotheses to be upheld by a [SoP], as required by s 120A(3) of the Act, each of its sub-hypotheses would have to be so upheld .</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">A complex hypothesis (that is, one comprising more than one element or part) can be no stronger than each of its elements or parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">" 
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">) 

47 In the present case, the Tribunal was bound to apply the McKenna principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It explicitly rejected that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">That was an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">On any view, one of the sub-hypotheses was that the effects of the veteran's "service related alcohol habit ... [had] impaired his concentration and contributed to the fatal collision" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">As the Tribunal failed to ask the question about the alcohol related sub-hypothesis, it failed to consider whether there was a SoP which upheld that sub-hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">48 Mr Green SC, counsel for the respondent, contended that even if the Tribunal had applied the McKenna principle to the SoP, it would have reached the same conclusion on the basis that there was no SoP which covered the hypothesis (and one assumes the sub-hypothesis) that the veteran was a heavy drinker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In particular, Mr Green relied upon the following findings of the Tribunal:
 
 "Contrary to submissions of the Respondent, there is evidence of the deceased being drunk on the evening prior to his death and hung over on the following morning... 
 
 Whilst I am satisfied that on the evening prior to the fatal collision the deceased --- having regard to the evidence of Mrs Codd --- had been drinking heavily --- I am satisfied that he metabolised the alcohol during the period between arriving at home at approximately 10.30pm and the collision at approximately 7.30am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">In those circumstances any alcohol residue at the time of the collision would have been so minuscule to safely permit a finding that at the time of the collision the deceased was not under the influence of alcohol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">" 

49 Mr Green's submission that there is no SoP relevant to the veteran's alcohol habit because there is a difference between 'a heavy drinker' and a person who suffered from 'alcohol abuse' or 'alcohol dependence' as defined in the SoP should be rejected on at least two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">First, it is well established that a SoP covers the field: see Woodward v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCAFC 160 ; (2003) 131 FCR 473 at [100] and the Explanatory Memorandum to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) which provided that the RMA will prepare SoPs based on " sound medical-scientific evidence " that will exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">50 Secondly, the threshold question posed by s 120(3) is whether the whole of the material before the decision-maker raises a reasonable hypothesis connecting the veteran's death with the circumstances of his service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This branch of the respondent's argument seeks to rely on only part of the material before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">51 The evidence before the Tribunal was that the diagnosis of Dr Epstein was that the veteran was a 'chronic alcoholic'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Dr Epstein's criteria for an alcoholic was " a person whose drinking interfered with their health, with the family life and their working capacity" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dr Epstein's evidence was that there was " certainly no doubt that [the alcohol habit] interfered with his family life" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">That view was consistent with the respondent's own evidence to the Tribunal that there was disharmony in the marriage because of the veteran's alcohol consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Having regard to diagnostic criteria A(1) and (4) for alcohol abuse in the SoP for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the whole of the material before the decision-maker would appear to suggest that at least some of the diagnostic criteria were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">That however is a question of fact for the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">CONCLUSION 
 
52 For the reasons set out above, the appeal should be allowed and the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on 24 October 2006 must be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The matter will be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be heard and determined according to law by a differently constituted Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">53 The applicant did not seek an order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">There will be no order as to costs.</sentence>
