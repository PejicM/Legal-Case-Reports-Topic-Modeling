<sentence id="s0">
 The Australian Communications and Media Authority has applied for orders that Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd pay pecuniary penalties pursuant to s 205F(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) in respect of 13 breaches of a condition in Radio 2UE's commercial radio broadcasting licence and for declarations recording each contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Each breach contravened s 140A(3) of the Act and attracted liability for a civil penalty (s 140A(7)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Each contravention attracted a maximum civil penalty of 500 penalty units, a total of $55,000 (see ss 139(3), 140A(3), 205F(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The breaches occurred over the course of 2 months in late 2007 when the well-known broadcaster, John Laws, failed to make disclosure announcements that he was sponsored by businesses at the time and as part of the broadcasts in which his sponsors', or their products' or services', names were mentioned during the course of his morning radio program, The John Laws Morning Show .</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I have attached a description of each contravention in a schedule to these reasons taken from the Authority's investigation report No 2100 of October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Mr Laws was paid very large sums of money by these businesses for their sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Authority had made a program standard known as the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000 pursuant to s 125 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The disclosure standard commenced in January 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It had been made following a report of the Authority's predecessor, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, called the " Commercial Radio Enquiry ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That had enquired into a broadcasting practice colloquially referred to as "cash for comment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The purpose of the disclosure standard was to require commercial radio licensees to ensure that whenever one of the station's presenters mentioned the name of a sponsor, or its products or services, the presenter made a disclosure announcement about his or her commercial relationship with the sponsor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Radio 2UE had to comply with the disclosure standard because this was a condition of its commercial radio broadcasting licence by force of cl 8(1)(b) in Sch 2 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There is no doubt that Mr Laws was fully aware of who his sponsors were and how much they were paying him on the occasion of each contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">But he did not comply with the obligations of Radio 2UE to make disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The parties prepared an agreed statement of facts which I will set out shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">They agreed that it was appropriate to suggest to the Court that a penalty of $10,000 per contravention should be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">That would result in a total of $130,000 in civil penalties being payable by Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Authority and Radio 2UE suggested that these figures were appropriate to reflect a penalty at the lower end of the range having regard to all the circumstances, including Radio 2UE's immediate co-operation with the Authority's enquiry, its contrition and acceptance of responsibility for the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In addition, Radio 2UE agreed to pay $20,000 in respect of the Authority's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The maximum penalties were $55,000 per contravention or a total $715,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Radio 2UE submitted that a number of matters should be seen as significant mitigating factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It contended that, overall, its conduct warranted a conclusion that a penalty at the lower end of the range was appropriate, as the Authority had accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Radio 2UE relied on the evidence of Graham Mott and his conduct in support of its position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Mr Mott had been the group general manager for the Southern Cross Radio network from February 2003 to 8 November 2007 when it was taken over by Fairfax Media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Since 9 November 2007 he has been the group general manager of Fairfax Radio Network where he is responsible for managing the day to day operations of 28 radio stations and ensuring their compliance with, among others, financial and legal regulatory requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He has had over 40 years experience in radio broadcasting, gained largely at music and talk-back radio stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Mott was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I accept that he gave his evidence candidly and honestly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, I must still weigh that evidence against the objective facts, the requirements of the Act and Radio 2UE's licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I also accept that Mr Mott, and through him Radio 2UE, intended that Radio 2UE would comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">But that compliance depended on its presenters', and in particular, Mr Laws', on-air behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">When the matter was first listed for hearing, I was concerned that, as this was the first action for civil penalties under the Act, the relationship between the contravention and a commercial licence might involve different considerations than those in other situations permitting the imposition of civil penalties for contraventions of other legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Accordingly, I asked the parties to consider whether there ought be a contradictor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Both opposed that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, the Authority identified the Communications Law Centre as a body that might be an appropriate intervenor: see Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 214.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Soon afterwards, the Centre sought to intervene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Centre appeared by its director, Prof Michael Fraser, and he and each of the parties provided considerable assistance at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">THE STATUTORY SCHEME 
 The objects of the Act are set out in s 3(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">They include: Significantly, the Act provides in s 4(1): 
 "The Parliament intends that different levels of regulatory control be applied across the range of broadcasting services, data casting services and Internet services according to the degree of influence that different types of broadcasting services, data casting services and Internet services are able to exert in shaping community views in Australia .</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">" (emphasis added) 

 The Parliament also expressed its intention that the Authority be the body charged with the duty of regulating, relevantly, broadcasting services in a manner that, in its opinion, enabled public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that did not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on providers of broadcasting services (s 4(2)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Act charged the Authority with responsibility for monitoring the broadcasting industry (s 5(1)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Act conferred on the Authority a range of functions and powers to be used in a manner that, in its opinion, would produce regulatory arrangements that were stable and predictable and would deal effectively with breaches of the rules established by the Act (s 5(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">And, in s 5(2) the Act provided that where it was necessary for the Authority to use any of the powers conferred on it by the Act to deal with a breach of the Act or regulations: 
 "... the Parliament intends that the ACMA use its powers or a combination of its powers, in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACMA, is commensurate with the seriousness of the breach concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">" 

 Radio 2UE held a public licence granted under the Act, namely, a commercial radio broadcasting licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The licence was subject to a condition that the licensee comply with program standards applicable to the licence under Pt 9 of the Act (Sch 2, cl 8(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Subclause 8(1)(b) of Schedule 2 provided:
 
 " 8 Standard Conditions of Commercial Radio Broadcasting Licences 

 
 (1) Each commercial radio broadcasting licence is subject to the following conditions:
 
 ...
 (b) the licensee will comply with program standards applicable to the licensee under Pt 9 of this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" 

 The disclosure standard was a program standard made applicable under Pt 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Relevantly, s 139(3) of the Act provided that a commercial radio licensee that engaged in conduct that breached a condition of cl 8(1)(b) of Sch 2 was guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of 500 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">THE 2006 AMENDMENTS 
 In 2006 the Communications and Legislation Amendment (Enforcement Powers) Act 2006 (Cth) was enacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It inserted s 140A into the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">That expanded the powers of the Authority to deal with breaches of licences by arming it with powers to bring civil proceedings to recover a civil penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Thus, s 140A(3) provided: 
 "(3) A commercial radio broadcasting licensee must not breach a condition of the licence set out in sub cl 8(1) of Schedule 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">" 

 The 2006 amendments also inserted s 205F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">That provided that if the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, it may order the person to pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty, known as a "civil penalty order" (s 205F(1) and (2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Relevantly, s 205F(3) provides: 
 "In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Federal Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including: 
 (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and 

 
 (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and 

 
 (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and 

 
 (d) whether the person has previously been found by a court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">" 

 The maximum pecuniary penalty payable in respect of a contravention of a civil penalty provision cannot exceed the maximum fine that could have been imposed had the person been convicted of an offence against the provision of the Act that corresponds to the civil penalty provision (s 205F(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">A pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth which it is entitled to enforce as a judgment debt (s 205F(8)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Only the Authority may apply for a civil penalty order (s 205G(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Authority also obtained the power to accept an enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This is a written undertaking given by a person, among other things, to take specified action in order to comply with the Act (s 205W(1)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Such an undertaking is enforceable under s 205X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Authority may apply to this Court for, among others, orders requiring the person to comply with the undertaking, directing the person to pay to the Authority, on behalf of the Commonwealth, a sum up to the amount of any financial benefit reasonably attributable to the breach that the person obtained directly or indirectly and compensation (s 205X(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in support of the Bill that became the 2006 amending Act explained the purpose of introducing the civil penalty and enforceable undertaking regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">This was to complement the use of enforceable undertakings by providing further mid-range enforcement options for the Authority and industry to consider in the event that a breach had been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">One express purpose considered in the explanatory memorandum was a perceived deficiency in the Authority's enforcement powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The explanatory memorandum said: 
 "For example, the experience of the ACMA in its attempt to prosecute the licensee of commercial radio service 2UE for multiple breaches of the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000 indicates some of the difficulties confronted by the ACMA because of its limited enforcement powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">" 

 The 2006 amendments were intended to address the then lack of middle range penalties to deal with breaches of the Act, regulations and licences by adding to the Act the civil penalty and enforceable undertaking provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Such breaches were ones that did not warrant criminal sanctions, suspension or cancellation of a licence (see EM pars 14, 16).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The explanatory memorandum referred to difficulties associated with criminal sanctions that had been highlighted following the Authority's findings in December 2003 that Radio 2UE had committed 19 breaches of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">However, later, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the Authority that on the evidence available there would be no reasonable prospect of a conviction of Radio 2UE in relation to those breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">These breaches also involved Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The explanatory memorandum observed that suspension or cancellation of a licence was a severe penalty that affected consumers of the service as well as the broadcaster who could be expected to suffer significant economic loss as a consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It noted that the Authority had never used this power in respect of breaches by commercial broadcasters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">THE DISCLOSURE STANDARD 
 The object of the disclosure standard was stated in cl 3 as being: 
 "... to encourage commercial radio broadcasting licensees to be responsive to the need for a fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest by requiring the disclosure of commercial agreements that have the potential to affect the content of current affairs programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">" 

 The disclosure standard applied to all commercial radio broadcasting licensees who broadcast current affairs programs (cl 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The standard required, relevantly: The disclosure standard defined a "current affairs program" as a program that had a substantial purpose of providing interviews, analysis, commentary or discussion, including open line discussion with listeners, about current social, economic or political issues (cl 6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Thus, the standard applied to "talk back radio", where the presenter and callers speak on-air about current topics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Additionally, the standard provided that a "commercial agreement" meant an agreement, arrangement or understanding: one of the purposes of which was that a presenter in exchange for any benefit or valuable consideration; 
- promoted a third party or its products, or services or interests;
 
- refrained from making negative comments about a sponsor; or 
 
- provided consultancy services in respect of publicity, promotion or public relations; or 
 which imposed obligations on a presenter to provide services in consideration of which the presenter or some service company, other than the licensee, would receive more than $25,000 p.a..</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The standard defined "sponsor" to mean a party to a commercial agreement (other than a presenter) as well as the party or parties who were directly to benefit from the promotion or other services provided by the presenter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">For the purpose of these proceedings a critical obligation was contained in cl 7(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That provided relevantly that: 
 "(1) ... a licensee must cause to be broadcast during a current affairs program a disclosure announcement at the time of and as part of: 

 
 (a) a broadcast of any material in which the name, products or services of a sponsor are mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" 

 
The disclosure announcement had to include at least one of the six phrases set out in cl 7(3), such as "[the name of the sponsor] ... is a sponsor of mine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">A licensee had to keep a register of current commercial agreements between sponsors and presenters of current affairs programs (cl 9(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">That register had to be available free of charge for public inspection and published on the licensee's website (cl 9(2) and (3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The register had to identify details of each commercial arrangement, including specifying the value or benefit to be provided under it as either falling within one of three bands, $10,000 or less p.a., more than $10,000 but not more than a $100,000 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">or more than $100,000 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">(cl 10(5)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Presenters had to disclose all commercial agreements to their licensee employer (cl 12).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">And, cl 13 provided that a licensee had to require each presenter to comply with relevant obligations imposed on the licensee by, among other things, the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The disclosure standard contemplated that a presenter would be able to earn remuneration directly from a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Generally such a third party would be a person who could have advertised on the presenter's employer's radio station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The licensee might lose the benefit of advertising revenue while the presenter used its licence to earn remuneration for himself or herself from the sponsor without accounting to his or her employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Moreover, unless the commercial agreement were disclosed on-air, listeners may not appreciate the true context for the presenter's reference to his or her sponsor or their product or service, including any apparently favourable treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The disclosure standard was intended to provide for transparency in broadcasting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">One important purpose was to enable a listener to judge whether a presenter's reference to one of his or her sponsors was his or her genuine opinion, or simply something that he or she was being paid to say as if it were their genuine opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is patent how such a practice could mislead listeners into believing that the references made to sponsors, their products or services or opinions expressed by a presenter, instead of being an advertisement or potentially an advertisement, were the presenter's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Thus, when a person telephones a talk back radio presenter of a current affairs program and discusses a particular product or service, mentioning a sponsor's name, unless the presenter disclosed that he or she was being sponsored by that entity, the public discussion which would occur between the presenter and the caller would not be transparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">After all, the presenter could select or pre-arrange for a caller who would mention the sponsor, product or service as part of the presenter's commercial arrangement with the sponsor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The chairman of the Authority, Chris Chapman, explained its reasons for commencing these proceedings in a media release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Radio 2UE relied on the media release, its dissemination and its terms as evidence of harm to Radio 2UE's reputation in respect of compliance and of its public denunciation in respect of the 13 contraventions (cf Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21 ; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 284-286 [52] - [59] per McHugh J, 303-304 [123] per Kirby J, 318-319 [177] per Callinan J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr Chapman said: 
 "ACMA has taken the step of applying for civil penalty orders against 2UE, having earlier tried to address 2UE's compliance failures through other means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">These latest breaches occurred at a time when 2UE had given ACMA an enforceable undertaking to improve its performance, particularly in relation to the John Laws Morning Show.... 
 
 However, ACMA ---and the Australian Broadcasting Authority before it--- has emphasised in previous findings against 2UE that the obligation to comply with program standards lies with the licensee itself; in fact it goes to the heart of a licensee's obligations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">

 
 Broadcasting licences are not given out lightly by government and convey significant benefit to those to whom a licence is granted .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It is a licensee's unrelenting responsibility to manage its business, including its presenters and production staff, so as to ensure satisfactory compliance with the regulatory requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">

 
 Company management put at real risk the retention of these licences when they allow on-air personalities or other staff to breach the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">One consideration informing the Authority's agreement to consenting to the civil penalty order was its assessment that Fairfax genuinely accepts that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">" (emphasis added) 

 THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF SS 140A AND 205F 
 The grant of the licence is a privilege to use the public resource of the radio spectrum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Abuse of the privilege, by breaching a condition of a licence, attracts liability under ss 139(3) and 140A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The primary purpose of s 140A(3) is to protect the public by holding licensees to the standard of conduct that their licence requires them to observe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The disclosure standard addresses a particular, and insidious, means of abusing the privilege of a commercial radio broadcasting licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">That standard recognised the significant degree of influence current affairs presenters could exert in shaping community views in Australia (see s 4(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The more prominent the presenter, the greater the potential he or she has to exert influence in shaping community views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The spoken word is the vehicle used to shape views on radio current affairs programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The identity of the speaker, if known to the audience, can itself influence their receptivity to what he or she says; as can the speaker's oratorical style and manner of delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">And, because of its orality, publication in a radio broadcast conveys a transient message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The listener may tune in or turn on the radio part way through a program; he or she may have missed an earlier disclosure announcement by the presenter when he or she returns to a topic that attracts an obligation to make such an announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">If it is not made, that new listener will not be aware of what the disclosure standard, and the licence, require be conveyed contemporaneously, namely the presenter's sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Additionally, listeners may not always be attentive to what is being broadcast on radio and may miss the significance, or indeed the occurrence, of an earlier disclosure statement in the same program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">That can affect the meaning which the listener understands to have been conveyed by what he or she hears the presenter saying later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">These characteristics of transient communications, such as radio or television broadcasts, are also recognised in the common law principles of defamation: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 165G-166E per Hunt CJ at CL, Mason P and Handley JA agreeing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Thus, the transience both of what is spoken on-air during a radio broadcast and of the listening audience (who may tune in or out at any time and, when tuned in, may pay closer or lesser degrees of attention) underlie the policy behind the disclosure standard's insistence on the presenter making a disclosure announcement contemporaneously each time one of his or her sponsor's name, products or service is mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The liability in s 140A(3) corresponds to, but is distinct from the criminal liability imposed by s 139(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The conduct proscribed by each section is the same, namely a breach of a condition of a licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2, including a breach of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">But the objects of the two sections are not the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">One object of s 140A(3) is to create a civil, not criminal, liability so as to enable the Authority to secure compliance with important provisions in the Act more readily than through criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">But another object of the section is to reinforce the norm of conduct for licensees in s 139(3) and to provide a means to enforce their compliance with it less drastic than the remedies existing before 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The Parliament provided that the civil penalty could match the criminal penalty for the same conduct of a commercial radio broadcasting licensee in breaching a condition of its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">However, the imposition of a civil penalty under s 140A(3) would not carry the stigma attached to a criminal conviction under s 139(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">And, pursuant to s 205K of the Act the civil penalty could be imposed after a trial using the civil onus of proof (see too s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)): see too Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 477-482 [19] - [38] per Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">A primary purpose of civil penalties is deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Hence, in assessing the penalty to be imposed, a court will consider whether, in all the circumstances relevant to be taken into account (here under s 205F(3)), others would be deterred by the penalty and at the same time the licensee will be penalised or punished appropriately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The range of relevant matters under s 205F(3) ordinarily will include (borrowing from what French J suggested in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152-52,153): The parties urged that no difference in approach to fixing an agreed civil penalty was called for under the Act as compared to the approach taken under legislation such as under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">They relied on what Flick J had said in Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [17] , [23]-[25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">He helpfully reviewed a large number of cases imposing civil penalties arising under a number of Acts: Pagasa [2008] FCA 1545 at [23] - [27] , concluding at [27]: 
 "Although the form of words set forth in other legislative provisions may be the same or comparable to those employed in the 1989 Act, the legislative mandate that the Court " must have regard to all relevant matters " in s 42Y(3) assumes obvious importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It is that mandate which directs attention to those more specific matters which can only be discerned from an analysis of the 1989 Act itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Of central importance in identifying those matters which are " relevant " --- and which must therefore be taken into account --- are the objects and purposes of the 1989 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">" 

 I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no "... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV" of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">However, I am of opinion that other considerations arise under the Broadcasting Services Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The purpose of regulation under the Act, including the imposition of civil penalties for contraventions of s 140A(3) under s 205F, must be gleaned from the detail of the provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The common law recognises that its remedy of damages for tort includes, in addition to deterrence, punishment and condemnation of both the actual wrongdoer's behaviour and the behaviour of another for whose conduct the defendant is answerable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Those objects are, therefore, not exclusively a function of the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47 ; (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 8 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ cited with approval Pratt LCJ's explanation in Wilkes v Wood [1763] EngR 103 ; (1763) Lofft 1 at 19 [98 ER 489 at 498-499] that exemplary damages are awarded "as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself".</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Court held in Lamb 164 CLR at 8-11 that the objects of an award of exemplary or punitive damages include: 
&#8226; punishment of a defendant;
 
&#8226; deterrence of that defendant and others; and 
 
&#8226; marking the Court's condemnation of the defendant's behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The fact that a defendant who is covered by compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance and so will not pay the sum awarded as exemplary damages from his, her or its own pocket, or that the defendant is the insurer, does not restrict the power of the court to award exemplary damages: Lamb 164 CLR at 11; Gray v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at 12-13 [32]-[36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, 29 [87] per Kirby J, 50 [141] per Callinan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">And, in New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57 ; (2006) 229 CLR 638 at 648 [38] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed: 
 "The common law fixes by various means a line between the interests of the individual in personal freedom of action and the interests of the State in the maintenance of a legally ordered society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">" 

 When the Parliament adopted the well recognised device of a civil penalty as a remedy for contraventions of the Act, it did not exclude, expressly or by necessary implication, the Court from having regard to objects that are not exclusively criminal such as punishment or condemnation, in addition to deterrence: see too CEPU 162 FCR at 477-479 [19]-[28].</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at 146 [35] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said that classification of proceedings as protective or penal wrongly assumed that those two objects were mutually exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">They held that a law may bear several characters, as may proceedings that seek relief which, if granted, would protect the public and penalise the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Talk back radio and current affairs programs of the kind that Mr Laws had, occupy a significant place in commercial radio broadcasting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Presenters of such programs can exert considerable influence in shaping community views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Union [1982] HCA 31 ; (1982) 152 CLR 25 at 98 as Mason J spoke of "... the overriding importance of freedom of discussion and speech", adding "without information, there can be no meaningful discussion": see too Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1992] HCA 45 ; (1992) 177 CLR 106 at 139-140 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It is now established that each member of the Australian community has an interest in disseminating and receiving information, opinions and arguments concerning government and political matters that affect the people of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The duty to disseminate such information is the correlative of the interest in receiving it: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 at 571 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The media fulfil a vital role in the ability of the Australian community and, in particular, electors to engage in the discussion of government and political matters, and ss 3 and 4(1) of the Act, in part, recognise this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The disclosure standard was a key instrument to ensure transparency in current affairs radio broadcasting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Failures to disclose could violate the public's ability to trust in the quality and nature of information conveyed in programs such as Mr Laws'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Unlike the regulation of economic behaviours provided in Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act , the Act creates the right to hold a licence but regulates the licensee's exploitation of that right for its own benefit, by imposing limitations crafted in, and to secure, the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">A commercial radio broadcasting licence confers an economic privilege on a licensee exercisable in accordance with the Act, standards and the conditions of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">These important and distinct features of the Act were recognised in the extracts I have quoted from Mr Chapman's media release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">For these reasons, I am of opinion that it is relevant to include, in the amount of a pecuniary penalty fixed under s 205F, in an appropriate case, some element of punishment of or retribution against, or stigmatisation of, a licensee which, in the course of conducting its business using the licence for its own profit, contravenes an important condition of the licence or the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The contravention of s 140A(3) by a failure to comply with the disclosure standard can amount to a violation of the public trust reposed in a licensee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">As Mr Chapman tellingly said, the obligation to comply with that standard "... goes to the heart of the licensee's obligations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Just as there is no single, correct sentence, so too there is no single, correct amount of a pecuniary penalty: cp Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [27] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">In arriving at an appropriate penalty, a court must give careful attention to the maximum provided for in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The maximum invites comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">And the maximum can provide a yardstick when balanced with the other relevant factors: Markarian 228 CLR at 372 [30]-[31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, ordinarily the worst possible case for a civil penalty would not be equivalent to the worst possible case for a criminal penalty under the corresponding section in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">That is because, first, the purpose of the Parliament providing for the civil penalty was to enable the Authority to use that power to address conduct not warranting the use of the corresponding criminal provision or the suspension or cancellation of a licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Secondly, if a person has been convicted of an offence (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">under s 139(3)) constituted by substantially the same conduct as attracts a civil penalty (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">under s 140A(3)) then s 205L prohibits the Court making a civil penalty order against that person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">And, s 205M stays civil penalty proceedings if criminal proceedings have been or are later commenced in respect of substantially the same conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">If the person is convicted, then s 205M(2) provides for the civil penalty proceedings to be dismissed, but the stay is lifted if the person is acquitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Conversely, s 205N authorises criminal proceedings to be commenced in the opposite situation; i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">after a civil penalty order has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">This preserves the option of later prosecution where, for example further evidence has come to light showing that a more severe penalty is called for than that in the civil penalty order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">There is a prosecutorial discretion to bring criminal proceedings under s 205N.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Ordinarily, some enlivening factor must arise after the conclusion of the civil penalty order proceedings to warrant the initiation of the criminal proceedings so that they would not be seen as an abuse of process in light of the policy in ss 205L and 205M (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">if facts subsequently were discovered, casting a different light on an apparently middle range contravention for which a civil penalty was appropriate, prosecution might be warranted).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Where ss 205L or 205M apply, the apparent intention of the Parliament, was to exclude the use of the civil penalty order if criminal proceedings result in conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">This is because the stamp or, possibility, of the conviction has characterised the contravention (even if only temporarily so, pending the determination of the criminal proceedings) as of a more serious kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">No doubt the civil penalty imposed would be relevant to the criminal penalty following conviction, where s 205N applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">But, s 205N must be read harmoniously with the legislative policy reflected in ss 205L and 205M: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69] - [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">PRINCIPLES WHERE PARTIES AGREE THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY 
 The Parliament conferred power on the Court to impose and to determine the amount of any pecuniary penalty: s 205F(1), (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">For many years the Court has recognised the ability of parties to such proceedings to make a joint or agreed submission as to the civil penalties to be imposed for contraventions of legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Agreement as to the suggested result can be reached prior to the institution of the proceedings for civil penalties, as happened here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Ordinarily, there will be savings in time and public and private expense that can be expected from parties putting forward, in a responsible manner (as they have in these proceedings) agreed contraventions and suggested penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The Court may reject the suggested penalty, and impose a different one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">But, in the ordinary case the use of this sensible approach will result in a speedy determination of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Such a consequence is obviously of considerable benefit to the community; a lengthy and expensive trial and possibly an appeal or appeals are averted and a just penalty is imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">But there is another, very important benefit in the approach; it gives the wrongdoer a degree of certainty and a speedy imposition of the penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Where a result is uncertain, such as the outcome of a contested trial and the consequent penalty (whether a criminal sentence or the imposition of a civil penalty), it is all too human for a wrongdoer to procrastinate in the hope that something will work out favourably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">But if a wrongdoer (such as a person who contravenes a civil penalty provision in legislation) can have relative assurance that, however severe, an agreed penalty is likely to be imposed promptly, that degree of certainty is a powerful spur to action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Ordinarily, the views of the Authority will be of significant weight in assisting the Court to fix an appropriate pecuniary penalty for a contravention of s 140A(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Authority's functions and role under the Act enable it to offer insight into the circumstances and impact of the contravention and the measures taken or proposed to guard against similar conduct in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">And, one purpose of enacting the civil penalty provisions was to give the Authority access to a greater range of enforcement measures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Thus, its choice of remedy and the manner in which it ought be imposed are important factors to weigh in assessing the appropriateness of its suggested pecuniary penalties: cp NW Frozen Foods Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290G-291C, where Burchett and Kiefel JJ said: 
 "Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">

 
 There is an important public policy involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">" 

 Their Honours emphasised that the Court in such cases recognised that the selection of a penalty is not an exact science and that, as in the formation of other discretionary judgments, there will usually be a range of penalties that could be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Generally, the Court does not undertake the exercise of fixing a penalty itself to assess whether it is prepared to give effect to the parties' suggestion: NW Foods 71 FCR at 291B-G. The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,632 [77] Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said: 
 "Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution's views on the appropriate sentence, so the court in the civil penalty case, as NW Frozen Foods explained, will take account of the regulator's position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence (in criminal cases), or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention (in civil penalty cases).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In each case, the Court should be satisfied that it is being given accurate, reliable and complete information on critical questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">" 

 Their Honours had emphasised earlier in their reasons that in civil penalty proceedings the view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant but not determative consideration on the question of penalty, adding ( Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-999 at 48,626 [51(iv)]): 
 "In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">" 

 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 107-108 [25]-[27] Lindgren J identified 11 propositions relating to the fixing of penalties under the Trade Practices Act as flowing from the decisions in NW Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 and Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 (and these were recently applied by Jacobson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v PRK Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 715 at [20] - [24] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">These included the propositions that: the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range; the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning; the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been "tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [regulator] in proving its case"; the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">THE STATEMENT OF AGREED FACTS 
 The statement of agreed facts dated 13 February 2009 tendered by the parties was as follows: 
 "The parties agree to the following facts:

 The Disclosure Standard 

 Following the findings published by ACMA's predecessor, the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) in the Commercial Radio Inquiry in August 2000, on 21 November 2000 a program standard was made known as the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000 (Cth) (Disclosure Standard).</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It was made pursuant to Pt 9, s 125 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">It commenced operation on 15 January 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It remains in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The Disclosure Standard relevantly provides that a licensee must cause to be broadcast during a current affairs program a disclosure announcement at the time of and as part of a broadcast of any material in which the name, products or services of a sponsor are mentioned.</sentence>

 The Enforceable Undertakings 

 On 31 August 2006, 2UE's ultimate holding company, Southern Cross Broadcasting (Australia) Limited reported suspected breaches of the Disclosure Standard to ACMA which allegedly occurred on the Show.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">On 12 October 2006, ACMA commenced an investigation into 2UE's compliance with the Disclosure Standard and other programming standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">On 25 September 2007, ACMA published a report of its findings from the investigation (2007 Report) that ACMA had undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">In that investigation ACMA found two (2) breaches of the Disclosure Standard by 2UE during a broadcast of the Show on 28 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">One (1) of those breaches of the Disclosure Standard involved a failure by 2UE to cause a "disclosure announcement" to be broadcast during the Show at the time of and as part of a broadcast of material in which the name, products or services of a sponsor of John Laws were mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">After these findings were made 2UE offered ACMA an enforceable undertaking pursuant to s 205W of the Act, which ACMA accepted on 24 September 2007 (Enforceable Undertaking).</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">2UE undertook to do certain things in relation to its compliance with the Disclosure Standard, including:
 
 11.1. to implement an effective administrative system for monitoring each broadcast of the Show to ensure compliance with cl 7 of the Disclosure Standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">This is to include a mechanism to ensure that, in the event that a disclosure announcement (of the kind described in cl 7(3) of the Disclosure Standard) is not made, 2UE will: 

 
 11.1.1. take action to cause such a disclosure announcement to be made at the earliest opportunity in that program; and 

 
 11.1.2. report to ACMA in writing within 72 hours of such failure to comply with the Disclosure Standard providing details of the non-compliance and the action taken; 

 
 11.2. to appoint an independent person to review at least four programs per fortnight of the Show, who will also prepare a report on compliance with cl 7 of the Disclosure Standard to ACMA within 14 days of each fortnight; and 

 
 11.3. to provide ACMA with five half-yearly reports in accordance with a timetable set out in the Enforceable Undertaking, indicating what action 2UE has taken in the period covered to ensure that ACMA is notified as required by cl 11 of the Disclosure Standard of any additional commercial agreements or variations to commercial agreements, entered into by 2UE's presenters or their associates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">

 
 The Compliance Assessment Report 

 Between December 2007 and October 2008, ACMA conducted a further investigation into 2UE's compliance with the Disclosure Standard (and the Enforceable Undertaking) and prepared a report, titled "Compliance Assessment Report - Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd" (2008 Report) detailing its findings.</sentence>

<sentence id="s301">" (footnote references omitted)
 THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE ENFORCEABLE UNDERTAKING WAS GIVEN 
 The background circumstances to the enforceable undertaking referred to in the agreed facts (at [8]-[11]) involved a previous substantial failure of Mr Laws to make proper disclosure of his sponsorship arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">This background is relevant for the purposes of determining the pecuniary penalty under s 205F(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Early in his program on Monday 28 August 2006, Mr Laws referred to the Commonwealth Government's decision announced the previous Friday that it would sell shares in Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Telstra was a sponsor of Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">During the course of that day's program Mr Laws interviewed the then Prime Minister concerning the Telstra share sale, invited listeners to participate in a web poll on Mr Laws' own website, read out emails from listeners and discussed with callers the proposed sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The program lasted 3 hours, but at no stage did Mr Laws make a disclosure statement concerning his commercial agreement with Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">This is the event referred to in [10] of the agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Although that description referred to one breach of the disclosure standard of a failure to make a disclosure announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Mr Chapman's media release of 26 November 2008 announcing the commencement of these proceedings said that the Authority had found that Radio 2UE had breached the disclosure standard 20 times during that broadcast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">And, the transcript of the program and other evidence supports Mr Chapman's description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">On 31 August 2006, Radio 2UE's holding company wrote to the Authority drawing Mr Laws' breaches of the disclosure standard to its attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">That letter informed the Authority that Radio 2UE was considering terminating Mr Laws' contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">This was the event in [8] of the agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Around this time Mr Laws went on annual leave and returned to air on Tuesday 26 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">On 7 September 2006 Mr Mott together with, Tony Bell, the managing director of Southern Cross Broadcasting, Adam Olding, Southern Cross Broadcasting's director of corporate affairs and general counsel and Radio 2UE's then general manager, Simon Rufhus, met with senior counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Senior counsel advised them verbally that Mr Laws' conduct did not entitle Radio 2UE to terminate his contract and that if it did so it would be likely to be in breach of contract itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Senior counsel warned that that could expose Radio 2UE to liability for very substantial damages and that Mr Laws may also be able to assert an entitlement to "equitable remedies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Mr Mott said that based on this advice Radio 2UE considered that it could not terminate Mr Laws' contract until a court determined that he had materially breached it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Mr Mott said that the contract did not contain a provision that allowed Radio 2UE to suspend or stand down Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The second reading of the Bill for the 2006 amendments occurred in the Parliament on 14 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Mr Ruhfus, wrote to Mr Laws on 25 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Mr Ruhfus drew Mr Laws' attention to extracts from a transcript of the program of 28 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">He continued, referring to a clause of Mr Laws' contract with Radio 2UE that: 
 "... requires compliance with ... the obligations imposed on 2UE pursuant to 'the Standards' which includes the Disclosure Standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">The requirements of the Disclosure Standard have been raised and explained to you on numerous occasions, including as recently as 22 May 2006 when you were provided with personal training in relation to the Disclosure Standard by Adam Olding, the General Counsel of Southern Cross Broadcasting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">... 

 
 This company is at a loss to understand why you failed to make the disclosure announcement as required by the Disclosure Standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">

 
 As a consequence of your failure 2UE has failed to comply with the Disclosure Standard .</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">This is a serious matter for this company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The issue is currently before the Australian Communications and Media Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">

 
 This company does not yet know what the consequences of your failure may bring from the Authority, nor indeed what may flow from activities of observers of this company's radio station who operate in the public arena.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">There may well be unfavourable consequences for this company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">To say that this company is very seriously concerned about your failure and about its possible consequences would be an understatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">" (emphasis added) 

 The letter set out the clause in Mr Laws' contract giving Radio 2UE the right to terminate it if his conduct caused Radio 2UE to be in breach of a condition of its licence or the disclosure standard (cl 7.4(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">On the same day, Mr Ruhfus and Mr Olding had a telephone discussion with Mr Laws who was in Hong Kong returning home from an overseas trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">They told Mr Laws about the breaches and reiterated the requirements of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">They told him that legislation was before the Parliament to give the Authority more power to prosecute breaches of the disclosure standard by imposing fines and enforceable undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Mr Laws told them that he understood the nature of his obligations under the disclosure standard and that his failures on 28 August were "simply an oversight".</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">He then asked if Mr Rufhus and Mr Olding were threatening to treat his conduct as a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Mr Olding's file note recorded that Mr Laws "... said if we did so he'd walk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Mr Laws also referred to the disappointment he would feel if Radio 2UE did that after all his years of loyal service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Mr Rufhus and Mr Olding also had a discussion on 25 September 2006 with Mr Laws' production team and re-emphasised the need for them to ensure compliance with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">They told the team of their concern about the nondisclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The team members indicated that they were either busy with other tasks and had not heard the broadcast of Telstra's name or had heard it but failed to prompt Mr Laws to make a disclosure statement due to oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">In late October 2006, the Authority began an investigation of the breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Southern Cross Broadcasting informed the Authority that Mr Laws had indicated that he was aware of the requirements of the disclosure standard and that his failure to comply was an oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Mr Mott met with Mr Laws in late November 2006 and discussed compliance with the standards,in particular the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Mr Laws said to Mr Mott that he was aware of the requirements of the disclosure standard and was "... doing everything possible to comply with them".</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">On 14 March 2007 Mr Mott wrote to Mr Laws informing him that since 4 February 2007 the Act had been amended (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">by the 2006 amendments) so that the Authority had additional enforcement powers including the power to seek civil penalty orders and to accept enforceable undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Mr Mott wrote that the imposition of a civil penalty would be a matter of grave concern to Radio 2UE and would bring it into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">He said his purposes in writing were to remind Mr Laws of his contractual obligation to comply with the standards made under the Act, to notify him formally of the Authority's new powers and to inform him that Radio 2UE would consider its rights under their contract with him should he fail to comply with the standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Mr Mott noted that the Authority's investigation into the 28 August 2006 breaches was continuing and his letter was not a waiver of Radio 2UE's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">He wrote that he wanted to highlight to Mr Laws how seriously Radio 2UE regarded compliance with the standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Mr Mott added: 
 "In light of previous compliance difficulties , I thought it was important to highlight the changes to the legislation and confirm our views on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">" (emphasis added) 

 During the next two days Mr Laws met with Mr Mott twice to discuss the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Mr Mott told Mr Laws that any further breaches of the disclosure standard would be unacceptable to Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">He said that Radio 2UE had a right to terminate the contract for a breach of Mr Laws' obligation to comply with the standards and, if such a failure occurred it would consider its rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">After the second conversation Mr Mott flew to Melbourne to report to Mr Bell on his discussions with Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">On 11 May 2007 the Authority provided Mr Bell with a draft report on its investigation of the 28 August 2006 breaches and, pursuant to the Act, afforded Southern Cross Broadcasting with an opportunity to comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">South Cross Broadcasting responded to the draft report on 28 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Around the beginning of June 2007, Mr Laws informed Mr Bell, of his intention to retire from on-air presenting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr Laws met with and told Mr Mott of this on 6 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">They agreed that Mr Laws' last day on-air would be 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Under the contract, Mr Laws could retire on giving 6 months notice and this date would coincide with the end of the calendar year season in the industry, which would allow sufficient time to arrange for Mr Laws' replacement in an orderly way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Mr Mott also agreed to this period of notice because Mr Laws also had not committed any further breaches of the disclosure standard since 28 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">He gained confidence from this that Mr Laws was taking his obligations to make disclosure announcements seriously and had reformed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">On a number of occasions Mr Mott suggested to Mr Laws that he should disclose his commercial agreements simply and in a positive way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">He told Mr Laws that by mentioning a sponsor or their product and then making a disclosure statement in a negative manner, the negativity reflected back onto the sponsor or their product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Mr Mott formed the view from these discussions that Mr Laws genuinely accepted that he was doing a disservice to the sponsors by being negative when making disclosure statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Mr Laws expressed the view to Mr Mott on a number of occasions between 14 March 2007 and 6 June 2007 that on-air presenting had become harder over the previous few years largely as a result of the obligations placed on him by the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Mr Mott believed from his meetings and conversations with Mr Laws after 28 August 2006 that the pressure which he and other senior executives in Southern Cross Boadcasting, including Mr Bell and Mr Olding had exerted on him in respect of his history of non-compliance with the disclosure standard, had played some part in his decision to retire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">On 25 June 2007, Mr Laws announced on his program that he was retiring from on-air presenting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">THE CONTEXT IN WHICH RADIO 2UE FAILED TO CAUSE COMPLIANCE BY MR LAWS 
 On 3 July 2007 Southern Cross Broadcasting agreed conditionally on the sale of its radio network to Fairfax Media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Mr Mott said that Southern Cross Broadcasting considered itself to be in a caretaker role of the parts of its commercial radio network that were to be sold pending completion of that acquisition in early November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">On 24 September 2007, Radio 2UE gave an enforceable undertaking to the Authority pursuant to s 205W of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The enforceable undertaking contained a specific obligation to monitor Mr l\Laws' program in cl 4.1, including the following terms: 
 " 4.1 Compliance with the Disclosure Standard 

 
 (a) Monitoring of the John Laws Morning Show 

 
 Within two weeks of the commencement of this undertaking, 2UE will implement an effective administrative system for monitoring each broadcast of the John Laws Morning Show to ensure compliance with section 7 of the Disclosure Standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The system will include a requirement that, in the event that a disclosure announcement of the kind described in section 7(3) of the Disclosure Standard is not made in accordance with section 7(1) of the Disclosure Standard, 2UE will take action to cause such a disclosure announcement to be broadcast at the earliest opportunity in that program, and will report in writing to ACMA within 72 hours of such failure to comply with the Disclosure Standard, providing details of the non-compliance and of the action taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">

 
 (b) Independent review of the John Laws Morning Show 

 
 Within two weeks of the commencement of this undertaking, 2UE will appoint an independent person to review at least four programs per fortnight of the John Laws Morning Show .</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The first fortnight will commence on the Sunday following the commencement of this undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">2UE will provide recordings of the programs to the independent person and, if requested by the independent person or ACMA, provide transcripts of those recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The independent person appointed will prepare a report on compliance with section 7 of the Disclosure Standard, based on the review of the programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The independent person appointed will provide a copy of each report to ACMA within 14 days of the end of each fortnight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">" 
 Thus, the enforceable undertaking specifically addressed the past shortcomings of Radio 2UE, through its presenter, Mr Laws, in making disclosure announcements that Radio 2UE was required to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">It had to "implement an effective administration system for monitoring each broadcast" of Mr Laws' program to ensure compliance with cl 7 of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Next, on 25 September 2007, the Authority published its report on the 28 August 2006 breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The findings that report would make when published had led to Radio 2UE giving its enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Radio 2UE had to monitor Mr Laws' program under cl 4.1(a) from 1 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">It appointed an independent reviewer on 4 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE 13 CONTRAVENTIONS 
 The contraventions concerned the following valuable commercial agreements that Mr Laws had with his sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">(I have used the numbering of the order of the contraventions set out in [13] of agreed facts in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">) Contravention 1 involved Mr Laws mentioning a sponsor on-air but failing to make a disclosure announcement until 90 seconds later in the broadcast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Contravention 6 involved a caller, on Mr Laws' talkback radio session, mentioning a sponsor on-air and then Mr Laws failing to make a disclosure announcement until 10 minutes later in the broadcast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The independent reviewer described contraventions 5 and 6 in her report of 26 October 2007 as follows: 
 "In one Toyota mention at 11:13am on Wednesday October 24 th , a caller mentioned Toyota and said John should ring the bell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">John did ring the bell but failed to declare Toyota as sponsors of his.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">

 
 In the same incident at 11:13am on Wednesday October 24 th John Laws rang the bell when a caller mentioned Byron Bay Beer but did not declare his sponsorship agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Ten minutes later at 11:33am,[sic] obviously reacting to prompting John said "did I say Byron Bay Beer are sponsors of mine?</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">I think I did" followed by a rant about being monitored .</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">" (emphasis added) 

 None of the other 11 contraventions resulted in a disclosure announcement being made at all on the day of the broadcast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Contraventions 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 also involved callers who made an on-air mention of a sponsor during a talkback radio session in Mr Laws' program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Contravention 8 occurred on Friday 26 October 2007 at 11.51 a.m. in a segment of Mr Laws' program called " The Best of the Lawsy Week ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">On that occasion a recording of contravention 7 taken from the previous Wednesday's program, was replayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">That segment, I infer, was a collection of recordings from earlier in the week that Mr Laws, or those producing his program, considered sufficiently memorable or significant that they were repeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Thus, whoever chose to repeat contravention 7 was reckless about the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">This was not a mere failure of the internal monitor or Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Rather, it demonstrated the absence of any real understanding within those responsible at Radio 2UE for compliance on Mr Laws' program with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Contravention 8 should never have occurred because it was part of a pre-recorded segment that had been chosen for repetition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">In the case of contraventions 7 and 8, a disclosure announcement of sorts relating to them was broadcast on 29 October 2007 at approximately 9.11am when Mr Laws said the following: 
 "Remember 'Stormin' Norman' last week?</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Norman was the caller that rang us on Wednesday howling against just about everything we do on this program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">He didn't like my alleged bias ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">I don't know what bias he referred to ... he didn't like the fact that I'd been reasonably successful and he didn't like the fact that I'm an ambassador for Hamilton Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">As you know Hamilton Island are sponsors of mine and I think in the heat of the moment ... maybe we didn't mention that the other day, but of course we live in this environment of total terror and we have to say that Hamilton Island are sponsors of mine in order to appease the Nazis and also to appease the terrified management of this broadcasting station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">I hope you are now all duly appeased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">We can get on with our lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">At least just for four more weeks, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE (cuts to music).</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">" (emphasis in the Authority's report) 

 It is obvious from the above extract, that Mr Laws had been told he had failed to make a disclosure announcement and had been required to make the disclosure later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">I will return to the content of that statement below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In fact, Mr Ruhfus had written to the Authority late in the afternoon of 26 October 2007, the day of the broadcast on which contravention 8 occurred, drawing its attention to Mr Laws' failure to make a disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">I do not consider that statement to have been sufficiently close in time to have any palliative effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The final contravention (13) occurred at approximately 11.25 am on Mr Laws' last 35 minutes of presenting before his retirement was to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">He had just finished talking to the well known singer, Normie Rowe, who had mentioned Byron Bay Beer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Mr Laws said: 
 "And of course I've got to say Byron Bay Beer are sponsors of mine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">" 

 
As shown in the Authority's report, Mr Laws then went on to say:
 
 "How bloody stupid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">When are you people going to get over it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Never?</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">What are you going to do next week when you don't have to sit around and listen to me all day in case I say Toyota?</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">[pause] Oh did you hear that, Alice?</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">He said Toyota!</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">God!</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">Boring old bastards!</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">13 13 32 is our telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">[pause] No, not our people here, the people at the ... whatever you call it, what do you call it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">ACMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">As I said yesterday, it sounds like a skin ailment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">" 

 THE SUBMISSIONS 
 The Authority submitted that it expected that the proposed declarations, pecuniary penalties and costs order would assist in raising awareness of the disclosure standard throughout the commercial radio broadcasting industry in Australia and contribute generally to deterrence from similar conduct by licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">In addition, the parties submitted that those orders would be a specific deterrent to Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">The joint submissions addressed a number of issues, and these were elaborated upon or supplemented by further submissions of each of the parties and the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">In determining a pecuniary penalty under s 205F(3) the Court is not confined to considering any of the four particular matters referred to in subparagraphs (a) --- (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">Rather, as the chapeau to s 205F(3) provides, the task is to "have regard to all relevant matters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">There is a degree of overlap in the considerations relevant to s 205F(3)(a) and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">It is not easy to segregate a matter as being wholly within one or the other of those two subparagraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">In my opinion it is not necessary to make any bright line segregation, so long as any matter which is itself relevant is considered in accordance with s 205F(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Public interest considerations
 The Centre argued that holding a licence imposed important legal, social and ethical duties and obligations on a licensee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">These included compliance with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">The Centre argued, and the Authority accepted, that the disclosure standard was a cornerstone on which the responsibility of the licensee to the public was built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">The Centre argued that the seriousness of the contraventions was underlined by the 23 related breaches of the enforceable undertaking to which I have referred above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The joint submissions recognised that the enforceable undertaking was a relevant matter to take into account as one of the circumstances in which the contravention occurred for the purposes of s 205F(3)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">I accept that that is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The Centre argued, and the Authority accepted, that a licensed broadcaster enjoyed a position of public trust and that the community was entitled to have confidence in the honesty and candour of broadcasts by a licensed commercial broadcaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The Centre also argued that it was vital in a democratic society that citizens be able to obtain reliable news, information and editorial commentary from trustworthy sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The Centre contended that, in that context, members of the audience would then be in a secure position to decide what weight to give to news, current affairs and commentary received from various reliable sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The Centre argued that the community was entitled to expect that commercial broadcasting radio licensees would adhere to the ground rules for conduct of their licence, including the disclosure standard so as to present their programs without hidden bias or hidden interests influencing the discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">It argued that without the disclosure of the presenters' interests, the interests of his or her undisclosed sponsors would be served and that it was important to maintain a proper distinction between advertisement and editorial comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">It argued that compliance with the disclosure standard was critical for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">And, the Centre argued that a failure to comply with the disclosure standard prevented or impeded the fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest contrary to the object expressed in s 3(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The Centre argued that the fact that the 13 contraventions involved commercial products and services did not detract from its argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">It said that information about those products and services influenced the public's views about them which in turn informed their attitude towards social, economic, commercial and political conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Products and services were, it contended, part of the public's day to day lives and these were not unimportant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">The Centre also argued that the community knew that commercial radio broadcasters such as Radio 2UE were regulated and would assume that what they heard on Radio 2UE complied with the regulatory regime in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">It argued that the contraventions were a serious breach of the public trust which the community was entitled to repose in commercial radio broadcasting licensees adhering to the conditions of their licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">It also argued that undisclosed sponsorship and endorsements had an adverse affect on the market for the relevant goods and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The Centre argued that an undisclosed sponsorship or endorsement implied that the presenter had a particular preference for the goods or services of a trader, as opposed to those of a competitor, and used his position of experience to persuade consumers to purchase in accordance with the recommendation, which was not his or her own genuine opinion, but a recommendation that had been purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">The Authority contended that the proceedings for a penalty were in aid of protecting the public interest which the disclosure standard was created to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">It argued that a primary question was whether or not a penalty was within a range adequate to deter the respondent and others from further contraventions of the standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">The Authority argued that in arriving at the agreed penalty it had considered the relevant objective and subjective factors, the importance of deterring Radio 2UE and the need to alert others to comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">It also noted that there had been a marked difference in the compliance culture and record of Radio 2UE since it came into new ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The Authority argued that the agreed penalty had regard to the number of breaches, their seriousness and Radio 2UE's persistence in them, rather than the nature of the individual breaches themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">It contended: 
 "If a penalty is given in the upper range, [the Authority] would face uncertainty in determining an appropriate penalty range in relation to breaches that are both large in number and potentially more damaging to the public interest in transparency, for example, undisclosed commercial sponsorship arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">" 

 I reject that last argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">If there were a large number of such breaches which were potentially more damaging to the public interest in transparency, the Authority has other sanctions to impose in the event that it considers a pecuniary penalty at the upper end of the range is not sufficient, by itself, to deal with the contraventions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">If there were a large number of contraventions, a penalty at the high end of the range would simply increase proportionately to the number of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Moreover, the Authority will be guided by the views of the Court in these proceedings where it has had the benefit of having a contested argument on the penalty to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">The Centre argued that the parties had not explained in their submissions why, applying the proper principles, the agreed penalty was appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">It pointed to the public nature of the licence and the right and opportunity a licensee had to operate a commercial broadcasting business based on the exploitation of the public asset being the radio spectrum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The Centre argued that the penalty should be in the upper half of the range and thus significantly higher than the agreed sums.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">It argued that the agreed penalty did not give adequate weight to the public interest aspects of the agreed facts and the surrounding background circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Radio 2UE argued that the joint submissions had identified the Authority's concern about Mr Laws' inappropriate attitude to the disclosure standard and the failure by Radio 2UE to comply with it, but submitted that there were substantial mitigating factors warranting a lower penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Radio 2UE argued that there was a public interest in bringing the litigation to a speedy resolution resulting in savings of resources for the Authority and the Court: Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,624 [41] and 48,627 [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">However, as Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said there, arguments in favour of the negotiation of settlements have to take account of the fact that it is the Court that bears the ultimate responsibility for determining the appropriate penalty: Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,627 [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The nature and extent of the contraventions: s 205F(3)(A)
 The parties submitted that the 13 contraventions related only to Mr Laws' program and not to any other programs broadcast by Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">They pointed to the fact that Mr Laws ceased to be an on-air presenter for Radio 2UE following his retirement on 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">And, the parties submitted that it was relevant that Fairfax Media acquired Radio 2UE on 9 November 2007 and that only the last four contraventions occurred after that time and then on the last day of Mr Laws' career.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The Authority argued that Mr Laws' commercial agreements were recorded on the register and there were various on-air disclosures even though not all of them were compliant with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">It argued that Mr Laws has now retired and there was no specific deterrent necessary for his conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">It argued that the new compliance regime adequately addressed the concerns arising from the previous regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The Authority noted that Radio 2UE had not deliberately engaged in the conduct and had taken steps to prevent it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">It accepted that Radio 2UE had acted bona fide, even if it had been ineffectual, in seeking to regulate Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Radio 2UE also argued that it was necessary to take everything into account before arriving at a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The last day of Mr Laws' broadcasting was one in which the compliance system failed to bring about an end to his contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">The particular contraventions did not, so Radio 2UE argued, go to the heart of freedom of speech and the other important objectives of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Loss or damage caused by contraventions: s 205F(3)(b)
 There was no quantifiable loss or damage caused by the conduct engaged in by Radio 2UE for the purposes of s 205F(3)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Neither Radio 2UE nor the Authority has received any claim or demand from a third person in relation to any alleged loss or damage suffered by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">That is hardly surprising since the nature of the breaches of the disclosure standard were unlikely to cause any loss or damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">However, the parties acknowledged that the absence of such loss or damage was not itself a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">The circumstances in which the contraventions took place: s 205F(3)(c)
 The parties submitted that the enforceable undertaking had been in place from 24 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">It required Radio 2UE to implement an administrative system to ensure compliance by Mr Laws' program with the disclosure standard and that the first contraventions took place on 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">The parties relied on the fact that Radio 2UE had engaged an internal monitor as part of its administration system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The sole function of the internal monitor was to monitor Mr Laws' program and ensure compliance with the disclosure standard by prompting him or the executive producer, if disclosures were not made appropriately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">The parties relied on Mr Mott's evidence of his belief that this would be an effective administration system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">In addition, the Authority had approved the general framework of that system and also believed it would be effective to ensure compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The joint submissions noted Radio 2UE's concession that, with the benefit of hindsight, the administration system was not effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">They submitted that the internal monitor was not adequately experienced or trained and, among other things, Radio 2UE should have appointed another person to review the recorded broadcast, after the live to air program, as occurred when the independent reviewer listened to pre-recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">The parties also submitted that during the period in which the contraventions occurred Radio 2UE had a compliance policy and had provided training to Mr Laws and all staff working on his program in addition to the annual training that they received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">They submitted that the contraventions occurred due to human error, being oversights of Mr Laws, the staff working on the program and the internal monitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The Centre argued that the 13 contraventions occurred in circumstances where Radio 2UE had not taken its obligations to establish a compliance system sufficiently seriously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">The Centre argued that the obligation of a commercial radio broadcasting licensee to comply with the disclosure standard was critical to its entitlement to remain licensed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">In that context, and in light of the failure of Radio 2UE's previous attempts to comply with the disclosure standard, the giving of the enforceable undertaking and Mr Laws evident dislike of the requirements of the disclosure standard, the Centre contended that the appointment of the person who was the internal monitor for Mr Laws' program was not sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">The Centre did not intend to criticise the appointee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Rather, it argued that because he was not sufficiently senior it could not be expected that he would be able to ensure that Mr Laws complied with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">The Centre argued that having regard to Mr Laws' recidivism in respect of his previous contraventions of the disclosure standard, Radio 2UE should have made a substantially more serious effort to ensure that Mr Laws complied in the future at the time of the giving of the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">It argued that ordinary businesses would take measures of sufficient strength to ensure that they would continue to be able to meet the conditions of a commercial broadcasting radio licensee's major resource, namely the continued entitlement to hold, and operate under, the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Radio 2UE argued that the Centre's criticisms of its compliance system were made without any evidence and simply reflected hindsight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It argued that the Centre's submissions ignored that the Authority had been aware of and approved the compliance system introduced at the time of the giving of the enforceable undertaking with the awareness and approval of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The parties relied on the evidence that after all the contraventions had occurred, Radio 2UE had implemented a number of significant changes to its compliance policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">They submitted that they expected that those changes would improve Radio 2UE's future compliance with the disclosure standard when coupled with the deterrent effect of the penalty to be imposed in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The parties submitted the sentencing purpose of deterrence would be served where a lower penalty was imposed if it would lead to the contravenor's future compliance because of further steps it had taken, such as effective and efficient improvements to its compliance system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Past proceedings: s 205F(3)(d)
 Radio 2UE has not been found by a court to have engaged in any similar conduct under the Act for the purposes of s 205F(3)(d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">However, the parties acknowledged that the Authority and its predecessor had previously conducted investigations into breaches of the disclosure standard by Radio 2UE in relation to Mr Laws' program, and that the results of those investigations in 2003 and 2006 had been set out in [11] and [15] of the agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">As I have said, the other evidence suggests that the 28 August 2006 program involved a significant number of contraventions of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">Radio 2UE said that the Court could not consider historical events prior to August 2006, beyond the material in the agreed facts in the joint submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">However, I consider that it is appropriate to have regard to the whole of the evidence, and the explanatory memorandum before the Parliament, which the parties provided, leading to the enactment of the 2006 amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">And, as Radio 2UE accepted, the disclosure standard was introduced as a result of the historical events involving Radio 2UE and Mr Laws, among other presenters, including the 2000 enquiry by the Authority's predecessor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">On the other hand, I accept Radio 2UE's argument that the Centre was not granted leave, as intervenor, to tender any evidence and is not entitled to rely on material outside the evidentiary context, or the Parliamentary materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The deliberateness of the contravention
 The joint submissions drew attention to Mr Laws' comments on 29 October 2007 together with those made by him when contravention 13 occurred on 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">The comments on 29 October related to both contraventions 7 and 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">I have dealt with Mr Laws' inappropriate comments of 29 October and 30 November above at [79]-[81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The parties submitted that Mr Laws was aware of the requirements of the on-air disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">I am satisfied that this is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">They then argued that he had indicated publicly on-air that his view of the requirement was that it was "excessive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">They argued that it was relevant to note that contravention 8 occurred before Fairfax Media acquired Radio 2UE and contravention 13 on Mr Laws' last day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Their submissions continued: 
 "If it were not for the other mitigating factors a substantially higher penalty would have been attracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Nevertheless, it is submitted that the proposed penalty is sufficiently substantial to alert others that the on air disclosure requirement must be complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">

 
 Notwithstanding John Laws' attitude, the parties submit that the evidence indicates that John Laws' failure to disclose was careless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">" 

 In support of the argument that the failure was "careless", the parties argued that 8 of the 13 incidents were on-air mentions of a sponsor by callers, as opposed to those initiated by John Laws and that three of the failures to make an on-air disclosure announcement were an oversight where an announcement was made subsequently, although not so as to comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Whether the contravention arose out of conduct of senior management or at a lower level
 The parties submitted that Mr Mott's evidence indicated that the failure to comply with the disclosure standard occurred at a lower level and that they were not reported to senior management by personnel at the time they occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">I will consider this submission in detail later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Radio 2UE's corporate culture
 The joint submissions noted that Radio 2UE's former ultimate holding company, Southern Cross Broadcasting had reported some suspected breaches of the disclosure standard to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The joint submissions also referred to Radio 2UE's comprehensive compliance policy that is now in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The submissions acknowledged the earlier policy had been ineffective in preventing the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Since then Radio 2UE has undertaken a number of steps to ensure that similar contraventions do not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">The joint submissions pointed to a number of matters, including the new parent company, Fairfax Media, undertaking a complete review of the compliance program and updating manuals and training materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">And, they noted that contracts for presenters are being reviewed and a new clause has been inserted in renewed or new contracts enabling Radio 2UE to suspend presenters in circumstances where a breach of contract is suspected, including a contravention of the disclosure statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The joint submissions also noted that a new general manager had been appointed to Radio 2UE in January 2009 and he has over 20 years experience in the radio industry in senior positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Fairfax Radio Network appointed a member of its legal unit to ensure regulatory compliance by Radio 2UE and she has had previous experience with Southern Cross Broadcasting's legal team.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">In September 2008 Radio 2UE began a new internal intranet capable of being accessed by all its staff, that includes copies of the compliance policy, the standards made under the Act and Codes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">In February 2008 Radio 2UE placed a time frame on presenters having to disclose their commercial agreements or amendments to existing ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">It also undertook a number of reviews of compliance with notifications for commercial agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The Authority expected that those steps would improve the compliance environment within Radio 2UE and will have the result of improving its compliance culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Radio 2UE's Co-operation with the Authority
 The parties submitted that Radio 2UE had co-operated with the Authority throughout its investigation of the current contraventions and its earlier one in 2006 that led to the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">The Authority accepted that this co-operation had occurred both through Radio 2UE and its ultimate holding companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">They submitted that the expense of a contested hearing was averted by the co-operation of Radio 2UE and its parent companies, Southern Cross Broadcasting and Fairfax Media, demonstrating a willingness to accept responsibility and facilitate the course of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">In addition, the parties relied on Radio 2UE's admissions of the contraventions, as acknowledgement of liability and co-operation with the Authority, its contrition and its commitment to improving its compliance program and continued introduction of measures to improve that program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The Authority also argued that the Centre's submissions did not take into account what it contended was the significant public interest promoted by Radio 2UE admitting liability before the proceedings were even commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Radio 2UE also argued that there was a public interest in not imposing a penalty that was oppressive having regard to the compliance measures subsequently put in place and the views of the authority as to their appropriateness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Breach of the enforceable undertaking
 The Centre noted that the Authority's report No 2100 had identified not only 13 breaches of cl 7(1) of the disclosure standard, but also a total of 23 breaches of cl 4.1(c) of the enforceable undertaking arising out of the 13 breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">There were two classes of breach of the enforceable undertaking, one being 12 instances where Radio 2UE had not taken action to broadcast a disclosure after a non-disclosure by Mr Laws, the second being 11 instances where Radio 2UE had not reported the failure to disclose and the action it had taken to the Authority within 72 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">Those additional matters are not the subject of this application for civil penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The Centre argued that the Authority had conflated each of those 23 additional matters with the 13 breaches of cl 7(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">I do not consider that in these proceedings it is appropriate to punish Radio 2UE by imposing a heavier penalty for the 13 contraventions because of its further breaches of the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">The circumstances in which those further breaches occurred are nonetheless relevant, in accordance with s 205F(3) of the Act, for the purpose of assessing the conduct of Radio 2UE, because of their contemporaneity and interrelation with the 13 contraventions and the extent to which they went unremedied: cf Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14 ; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at 640 [32] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Alternative enforcement options
 The Centre identified other enforcement powers that were available to the Authority, which it had not sought to use in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">It relied on the context of the Parliament's decision to expand the potential remedies available to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">Under s 143(1) the Authority was given power, by notice in writing, to suspend a licence for such period, not exceeding three months as was specified in the licence or to cancel the licence where a commercial radio broadcasting licensee breached a condition of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">In addition, s 205X provided the Authority with power to apply to the Court, where a person had given an enforceable undertaking under s 205W that the Authority considered had been breached, for orders that included any order that the Court thought appropriate (s 205X(2)(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The Centre argued, that accordingly, the Authority had formed the view that it would proceed with the less drastic remedy of seeking pecuniary penalties under s 205F and declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">The Authority and Radio 2UE both argued that the availability of other sanctions was not relevant to the quantum of a civil penalty to be imposed and that Radio 2UE should not be penalised more severely because of the existence of other enforcement remedies which the Authority chose not to employ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">I accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Deterrence
 The Authority argued that because of its central role in the regulation of the industry and the place which the Act gave it in that regard, it was well placed to assist the Court in identifying the appropriate range of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Moreover, the Authority argued that its contacts with industry gave it an insight into the level of penalty which would be seen as a sufficient deterrent to avert other breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">The Authority accepted the submissions made by the Centre that there was a significant public interest in radio presenters of current affairs program not having undisclosed sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The Authority argued that the protection of the public interest was not an independent factor which had to be given weight when assessing the penalty along with other relevant factors, but simply the outcome of the penalty process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">Radio 2UE also contended that weight should be given to the Authority's views that the publicity surrounding the contraventions as well as the amount of the proposed penalty of $130,000 in total would operate to deter future breaches by both itself and other licensees and heighten awareness of the requirements of a disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">And, Radio 2UE contended that it had considered the possibility of terminating Mr Laws' contract after the 2006 contraventions, but did not do so based on senior counsel's advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">This showed, it argued, that it had taken those breaches sufficiently seriously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">The Centre argued that the agreed penalties would not be an effective sanction nor credible in the eyes of the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Radio 2UE disputed the Centre's arguments that the joint submission had not given sufficient attention to public interest considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Radio 2UE also argued that while the history of Mr Laws' contraventions of the disclosure standard provided a context they should not be given undue weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">It was not liable in these proceedings to a penalty for its prior conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Rather, it argued that it had demonstrated its responsibility by bringing Mr Laws' contraventions in August 2006 to the Authority's attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">And it argued that the occurrence of the 13 contraventions after, and in breach of the enforceable undertaking, should not be seen as an aggravating circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">It argued that it took about 12 months work between Radio 2UE and the Authority to arrive at a compliance system to satisfy the Authority that the enforceable undertakings were acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">FINDINGS: NATURE, EXTENT AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CONTRAVENTIONS 
 I accept that live to air broadcasting, especially involving talk-back radio where spontaneous statements are made, requires licensees, their staff and presenters to be attentive and make disclosure announcements in a very short time frame.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">But that is the ordinary standard for such broadcasting to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The disclosure standard applies and is enforced as a condition of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">The enforceable undertaking was offered by Radio 2UE as a means of satisfying the Authority that, despite Mr Laws known recidivism in relation to the disclosure standard, Radio 2UE would take appropriate measures to prevent recurrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">I reject the parties' submission that the contraventions arose at a lower level of management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Persons in the position of Mr Laws were recognised by s 4(1) of the Act to be in a position to shape community views in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Mr Laws was a well-known and seemingly influential "star".</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">His views and endorsements appear to have been so significant that he could invite the Prime Minister to appear on his show to discuss current affairs (such as the occasion which led to the enforceable undertaking).</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">As the Centre pointed out in its submissions, the ability of the media, including radio, to influence public perceptions of events is significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Radio 2UE had a privilege conferred on it under the Act to conduct a broadcasting service on the public radio spectrum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Conditions of its licence required it to ensure that the disclosure standard's requirements were met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Mr Laws had significant and valuable commercial agreements with six different sponsors in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">I infer that those sponsors saw considerable benefit to their businesses in having Mr Laws refer to and promote their names and brands, products or services in as favourable light as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">It can also be safely inferred that he was seen by his sponsors to be able to use Radio 2UE's licence to influence public awareness and opinion with respect to their own products or services (see s 4(1) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">Material which is designed or calculated to draw public attention to a person, product or service or to promote its use may constitute an advertisement: Director of Public Prosecutions v United Telecasters Sydney Ltd [1990] HCA 5 ; (1990) 168 CLR 594 at 598 per Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, 605 per Toohey and McHugh JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">And, Radio 2UE was conscious that Mr Laws was not only able to use its licence in this way, but that he had done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Section 140A(3) in terms, imposes liability directly on a licensee by requiring it not to breach a condition of its licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2 to the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">That liability is not a vicarious liability imposed on Radio 2UE for the conduct of its presenters, but a direct liability on it: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 127-128.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">There, Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ held that when an employee acted in the course of his or her employment he or she did so as the embodiment of the corporate employer: Hamilton 166 CLR at 127; Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153 at 170 per Lord Reid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Under s 140A(3) a corporation will incur liability for what its agent, Mr Laws, did or failed to do to comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">This is because Mr Laws was acting as the licensee when using its licence to broadcast his program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ said of a provision similar to s 140A(3) in Hamilton 166 CLR at 127 that it: 
 "... speaks directly to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">It is not a case of a company being made liable for an act performed by a servant of the company on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The liability imposed is direct, not vicarious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">The distinction was drawn by Viscount Haldane LC in Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd ([1915] AC 705 at p 173).</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Its significance is explained by Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass ([1972] AC 153 at p 170): 

 
'I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">A corporation has none of these: it must act through living persons, though not always one or the same person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company .</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">There is no question of the company being vicariously liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">He is not acting as a servant, representative, agent or delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">He is an embodiment of the company or, one could say, he hears and speaks through the persona of the company , within his appropriate sphere, and his mind is the mind of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">It must be a question of law whether, once the facts have been ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the company or merely as the company's servant or agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">In that case any liability of the company can only be a statutory or vicarious liability.</sentence>

<sentence id="s630">

 
 There can be no doubt, on the facts of the present case, that the respondent, in placing the advertisement and in dealing with those who replied to it, was the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">He was its managing director and his mind was the mind of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The company therefore was liable as a principal for the breaches of s 169 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The liability was direct, not vicarious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">" (emphasis added) 

 A breach of the disclosure standard by Mr Laws was also a breach by Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">The joint submissions appeared to divide Mr Laws' responsibility for breaching the disclosure standard from that of Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">In my opinion, this is a fundamental misconception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">When Mr Laws committed each of the contraventions complained of, he was Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">He was not merely an agent or minor employee for whose acts or omissions Radio 2UE was vicariously responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Rather, Mr Laws was the embodiment of Radio 2UE using its commercial radio licence to promote, or assist the promotion of, his sponsors or their products or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">The fact that, on some occasions, a caller mentioned the sponsor's name did not derogate from this consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">Rather it appeared to have been part of Mr Laws' program to engage in discussion about his sponsors, their products and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Listeners to commercial radio licensees' programs may not able to know how it came to be that a caller mentions one of a presenter's sponsor's name, product or service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The caller could be an agent of the sponsor or the presenter, for all the listening audience would know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">But, I have no doubt that Mr Laws knew the names, products and services of his sponsors and that, if one of these was mentioned by him, a guest or caller on his show, he had an obligation to make a disclosure statement at the time of that mention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">He knew that this was a condition of Radio 2UE's licence and that the Act required Radio 2UE and himself to comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Mr Laws was Radio 2UE's "star", its means of earning substantial advertising revenue by attracting listeners to his show.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">The fact that he could earn substantial sums himself, from sponsors under commercial agreements, demonstrated just how valuable he was to the enterprise of Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">His conduct in using the licence was a central element of each of the 13 contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">That unlawful conduct is not addressed in an appropriate way by the agreed penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">One reason that the Parliament enacted the civil penalty and enforceable undertaking provisions in the 2006 amendments was to overcome the difficulty in enforcing criminal sanctions under the Act in respect of previous contraventions of the disclosure standard specifically by Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">And that standard itself had been made, in part, as a result of his yet earlier conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">The parties' submissions treated Mr Laws' conduct as of relatively lesser importance in fixing a penalty than the other factors they addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">I consider that Mr Laws' conduct and his role in the contraventions are fundamental to the fixing of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Radio 2UE complied largely with the form of the enforceable undertaking, but not with its substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Neither Mr Mott nor Mr Ruhfus read any of the independent reviewer's reports for the periods during which the 13 breaches of the disclosure standard the subject of these proceedings occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">The reports were sent by email to the Authority, Mr Mott and Mr Ruhfus and I infer, since they were received by the three recipients, at the same time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">These reports identified a number of failures by Radio 2UE, through Mr Laws, to broadcast disclosure announcements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">The format of each report consisted of a short two page summary, identifying the 4 days monitored, statements as to the degree of compliance by Mr Laws with his disclosure obligations in live reads of advertisements, the incidental mention of his sponsors or their products and the reviewer's conclusion of any failure to disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">For example, in the report dealing with the 4 days she monitored in the 14 days ending 26 October 2007, the independent reviewer noted each of the five contraventions on 18 and 24 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">The reviewer provided that report on 29 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">The reviewer's next report for the period ended 9 November 2007 identified the contravention on 2 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">That was the last contravention before 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Mr Mott did not recall receiving the independent reviewer's reports but accepted that he must have received the emails forwarding them to the Authority, Mr Rufhus and him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Mr Mott's usual practice was to review all emails sent to him and he was surprised by his failure to do so in respect of these reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">However, Mr Mott was sure that he did not read those reports in 2007 and that Mr Ruhfus did not bring them or their contents to his attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Mr Mott considered that his heavy work load at the time was the likely reason for his not having read the reviewer's reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">Mr Ruhfus did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Mr Mott was the most senior of Southern Cross Broadcasting's employees who were to transfer to the Fairfax Radio Network as part of the latter's acquisition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Mr Mott said that he had a heavy involvement in the transaction as the time for completion approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">He was involved in a number of meetings and was away from his Melbourne office for extended periods of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">I am satisfied that he was very busy during this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">He received many emails in respect of the transaction and, on completion on 9 November 2007, he changed his email address, so that after then he had to access two different addresses for his work related emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Radio 2UE relied on these pressures on Mr Mott during October and November 2007 as explaining his failure to read any emails from the independent reviewer appointed under the enforceable undertaking that drew attention to Mr Laws' breaches of the disclosure standard in that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">Mr Mott accepted, he said with the benefit of hindsight, that he and Mr Ruhfus ought to have focussed on the content of the independent reviewer's reports and taken action in respect of the non-disclosures they revealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">He said that action should have included raising those matters directly with Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">Mr Mott said that Radio 2UE's administration system at that time was not effective for those and the following 6 reasons: 
 (1) the internal monitor employed by Radio 2UE may not have been comprehensively trained before beginning work on 1 October 2007;
 
 (2) "management at Radio 2UE did not have time to properly consider how to comply with the other requirements of the Enforceable Undertaking, namely to cause a disclosure announcement to be broadcast as soon as possible after the omission and to notify [the Authority] within 72 hours of these occurring";
 
 (3) Radio 2UE should have appointed a person to review the recorded broadcasts after the live to air program;
 
 (4) the time lag that occurs between introducing a new compliance measure and when improvements are noticed after staff learn their role and gain competence;
 
 (5) the internal monitor had to listen to Mr Laws' program with great intensity for 3 hours a day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Mr Mott had only learnt after Mr Laws retired that the internal monitor had suggested to the independent reviewer having more than one monitor so that they could alternate;
 
 (6) Radio 2UE should have retained a more senior person, with more experience of the requirements of the disclosure standard to deal with Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Mr Mott also reflected on other reasons why the 13 breaches occurred in late 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">He said that Mr Laws' 6 commercial agreements were the most any on-air presenter had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Mr Mott speculated that the significant number of sponsors and the number of products each of them had "would have made it very difficult for Mr Laws to make the disclosure announcement each and every time the sponsor [or] their products were mentioned".</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">Mr Laws had explained his earlier breaches as an oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">Mr Mott said that owing to the nature of live radio, once an oversight occurs, it will only be rectified if it is noticed and someone causes Mr Laws to make a disclosure statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">Mr Mott said that Mr Laws' attitude to complying with the disclosure standard was "... at certain times negative and this made it difficult for staff of [Radio 2UE] to ensure that he consistently complied with ..." that standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Mr Mott said that on a number of occasions between 1 October 2007 and 30 November 2007 he enquired of Murray Olds, the executive producer of Mr Laws' program, whether the new system was working and that Mr Olds told him that the internal monitor had prompted both Mr Laws and Mr Olds of the need to make disclosure announcements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Mr Mott said that this led him to believe that Mr Laws was fully complying and that the new administration system for the enforceable undertaking was also working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPLANATIONS BY MR MOTT 
 Mr Mott's explanations for Radio 2UE's 13 contraventions were insubstantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">Mr Mott only learnt of the 13 contraventions in late February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">If Mr Mott or Mr Ruhfus had read the independent reviewer's reports when received, as they should have, the deficiencies in the internal systems would have been apparent to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">The internal monitor was trained in part before 1 October and he was retrained by Mr Olding on 4 October 2007, the day before the first two contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">Moreover, the internal monitor was not the only person who had responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Mr Laws had the primary responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">It was part of his job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">He disliked the obligation, as the independent reviewer's description of his "rant" on 24 October and his behaviour on 30 November 2007 showed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Mr Olds and the other production staff for the program must also have been well aware of the disclosure standard and Mr Laws' commercial agreements with his sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Mr Mott said that he and Mr Olding had given additional training to Mr Laws, Mr Ruhfus and the production staff as recently as 28 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">Each of those persons had an hour's training and they received copies of Radio 2UE's printed booklet setting out its compliance policy and the relevant requirements of the Act and standards with which they had to comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">I do not accept that any of the 13 contraventions arose because Mr Laws overlooked that he or a caller had mentioned a sponsor or one of its products of services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">First, there was no evidence from him that he did "overlook" any of those mentions or his duty to make a disclosure announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">Secondly, he was paid a large amount by each sponsor and it was his responsibility to be aware of the consequence of mentioning their names, products or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">He controlled the content of his program and encouraged his callers to mention his sponsors, their products and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">I infer that one significant reason for the 13 contraventions was identified by Mr Mott in his last reason; namely that Mr Laws resented having to make disclosure announcements and he made it hard for the staff to remind him of the need to make one when he had omitted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">But this attitude and the problems that it had caused Radio 2UE over the past years was known to senior management of Radio 2UE including Mr Mott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">Radio 2UE chose to take the risk of breaching the law through the faith it placed in, and lack of appropriate steps to control the on-air conduct of, its presenter, Mr Laws, knowing of his earlier failings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">I reject the argument that Mr Laws' failures were "careless".</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">His failures to disclose were made by a professional presenter being paid over $400,000 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">by these sponsors to mention their names, products and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">He was well aware of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">I am not prepared to accept his failures as "careless" or "oversights" in the absence of evidence from Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">At least a portion of Mr Laws' programs on each of the relevant days involved discussions with his callers about his sponsors or their products or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">In other words, the mention of the sponsors, their products or services was an integral part of Mr Laws' program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">This may explain why the sponsors (other than Byron Bay Beveridges) were prepared to pay in excess of $100,000 each for Mr Laws to promote them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">They may have received value for their money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">But the relevant price for that was the duty of Radio 2UE to see that Mr Laws complied with the Act, the licence and his contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">His assertions that this duty created an "... environment of total terror" and that his obligation to comply with the law was "in order to appease the Nazis and also to appease the terrified management of this broadcasting station" demonstrated a disturbing disregard for his obligations, and the privilege that his use of Radio 2UE's license gave him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">Mr Laws was a professional presenter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">But, he was a recidivist with respect to complying with the standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">His statement, when he made his announcement on 29 October 2007, that "maybe we didn't mention" the name of the sponsor on the previous occasion is not evidence I would accept of any carelessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">The terms of Mr Laws' purported disclosure announcement made on 29 October 2007 should have raised concerns for the management at Radio 2UE about, first, his continuing resentment of having to comply with the disclosure standard and, secondly, whether the monitoring system would be effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">There was no evidence to explain the circumstances in which the announcement of 29 October 2007 came to be made (other than the inference that Mr Ruhfus, having sent the letter to the Authority, asked Mr Laws to make it) or, what, if anything, was done after it to ensure compliance by Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">And, contravention 13 was not careless; it was a deliberate contravention made with the intention of bringing the disclosure standard into contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">Radio 2UE committed the contraventions because it allowed Mr Laws to present his program and to make the statements that he did without any proper control to stop him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">When he was broadcasting, Mr Laws was Radio 2UE for the purpose of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">AGREED PENALTY 
 I accept that Radio 2UE (either directly or through its holding companies), albeit after the event, demonstrated a responsible attitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">Radio 2UE has given substantial attention to developing effective compliance programs since the contraventions and both it and the Authority consider that these will be effective in reducing the risk of future contraventions of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">While Radio 2UE is entitled have the penalties mitigated because of its responses to the contraventions and its good faith in its ineffective attempts to comply with the disclosure standard, it cannot relieve itself of the gravity of its contravening conduct (being the conduct of its presenter, Mr Laws).</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">It may have its own remedies in contract for damages against Mr Laws for his breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Had Radio 2UE told Mr Laws that it would seek to hold him liable for damages for breach of contract in the event that it incurred costs of any investigations into a contravention by him of the disclosure standard and the amount of any pecuniary penalty imposed, it is likely that he would have been far more concerned to comply with the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">At common law the fact that an accused person has pleaded guilty is a matter properly to be taken into account in mitigation of his or her sentence in a criminal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">That is because it is usually evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender, and secondly, an acceptance of responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">It may also indicate a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: see Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 ; (2002) 209 CLR 339 at 343 [11] - [14] per Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">In Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 404-405 [73] - [76] , Stone and Buchanan JJ considered the applicability to civil penalty proceedings of the common law principle of affording a discount to a sentence imposed after a plea of guilty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Stone and Buchanan JJ concluded that the rationale for providing a discount for an early plea of guilty in a criminal case did not apply neatly to a case where a civil penalty is sought and the case proceeded on pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">They said, that nonetheless, it should be accepted for the same reasons as given in Cameron [2002] HCA 6 ; 209 CLR 339 , that a discount should not be available simply because a respondent has spared the community the cost of a contested trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">They held that the benefit of such a discount should be reserved for cases where it can be fairly said that an admission of liability, first had indicated an acceptance of wrongdoing and a suitable and credible expression of regret, and or secondly, had indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: Mornington Inn 168 FCR at 405 [76].</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">I am satisfied by Mr Mott's evidence and the Authority's acceptance of the measures that Radio 2UE now has in place that those measures provide a better means of ensuring compliance by presenters with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">It is not necessary to give the detail of the measures here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Radio 2UE has learnt from its experience of Mr Laws' breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">In addition, he has retired and Radio 2UE now has inserted into its contracts with presenters a right to suspend a presenter immediately if it reasonably believes that he or she may be in breach of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">On behalf of Radio 2UE, Mr Mott expressed deep regret for the occurrence of all 13 breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">I accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">I am satisfied that Radio 2UE has genuinely accepted its wrongdoing in its contravening conduct and, through Mr Mott and its co-operation in the conduct of the earlier investigations and in these proceedings, it has made a genuine expression of its regret.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Radio 2UE also indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice by this commendable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">These factors warrant some reduction in the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Radio 2UE also submitted in reply: 
 "Further, the widespread public knowledge of Mr Laws' conduct and views about the disclosure standard and related public criticism of that conduct prior to October 2007 as referred to by [the Centre] together with the context of each contravention, mean the [Centre's] concerns about the 'undermining of public discourse' and its 'corrosive effect on public debate', and the 'distortion of the market' have to be tempered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">" 

 I reject that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">The fact that the 13 contraventions occurred given the history of Radio 2UE's previous failures to comply, because of its presenter's, Mr Laws', conduct and views, adds to the seriousness of these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">Licensees must be on notice that such violations of the public trust will attract substantial penalties, even in the enforcement tier into which the civil penalty proceedings fall under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">One of the primary purposes of imposing a penalty is to penalise the wrongdoer for its contravention of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">The amount of that penalty must be in a sum that is appropriate in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">There will be occasions where one person contravenes the law in circumstances where one penalty might be appropriate, but if a different person commits the same breach the same circumstances might dictate that a substantively different penalty would be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">This is commonplace in explaining why a first offender may receive a lesser penalty than a person who has a substantial record of offending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">The element of deterrence may be but one of the considerations relevant under the applicable statutory scheme which a person imposing a penalty or sentence must take into account in arriving at a sanction which is appropriate in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">The position of public trust and the damage which can be done to the integrity of broadcasting by breaches of the disclosure standard mean that these contraventions, generally, must be seen to be within a higher scale than that chosen by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">This is not a case of a licensee with no prior history of the kind which Radio 2UE had in relation to Mr Laws as the references to that history in the agreed facts accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">Radio 2UE was in the position it was, after giving the enforceable undertaking, because of its earlier failures to implement a proper system for compliance on Mr Laws' program with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">And, cl 13 of the disclosure standard obliged Radio 2UE to require Mr Laws to comply with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">Radio 2UE has only itself to blame for its failure to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">I am of opinion that, overall, the 13 contraventions could not properly be characterised, in the way the parties argued, as towards the lower end of the range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Some, however, were at the lower end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Mr Laws used Radio 2UE's licence to promote his sponsors for his significant financial benefit without complying with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">That standard clearly irritated him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">Radio 2UE was aware of his dissatisfaction with having to obey the law in earning his considerable income from his commercial agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">It had given an enforceable undertaking that put in place a new compliance system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">That system, through the independent reviewer, actually identified the first contraventions on 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">But, as I have found, Radio 2UE ignored its obligations under the enforceable undertaking and none of its officers bothered to read the independent reviewer's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Mr Mott explained (and I accept) that, in his case, this was due to pressure of work and oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">But there was no evidence from Mr Ruhfus why he did not read these or if he had what he did in response or why no-one else had that simple reading task delegated to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">The contraventions were obvious as soon as the short, lucid report was opened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">Mr Laws' contraventions, and hence Radio 2UE's, continued thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">A commercial radio broadcasting licensee must appreciate that it is responsible for its presenter's breaches of the Act and its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">It must take real, and not perfunctory steps, as Radio 2UE did in October and November 2007, to ensure its compliance with the Act and licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">Unless this realisation is promoted there is a real risk of further contraventions of the disclosure standard by Radio 2UE and other licensees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">A pecuniary penalty of $10,000 for each of the 13 contraventions for these serious breaches by the presenter who was a stimulus, first, for the introduction of the disclosure standard and, then, the 2006 amendments is manifestly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">I am of opinion that, in general, the individual penalties of $10,000 are, and the total for the 13 contraventions of $130,000, is as a whole unreasonable and plainly unjust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Thirteen accidental slips over a two month period by a presenter with an unblemished record, depending on the circumstances, may attract pecuniary penalties at the lower end of the scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">But Radio 2UE cannot be seen to get such benign, indeed ineffectual, treatment for Mr Laws acting as Radio 2UE when breaching the disclosure standard in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">Radio 2UE cannot be allowed to rely on its inability to ensure that its presenter, Mr Laws, with his history, scrupulously adhered to the conditions of its licence and obeyed the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Overall, the contraventions in this case are of a serious nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">They indicate that there was a significant failure of Radio 2UE to take proper and sufficient steps to ensure that Mr Laws, in fact, complied and continued to comply with the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">Not only did the Act and its licence require it to ensure that Mr Laws complied with the disclosure standard; as a result of Mr Laws' last serious contraventions it had just given an enforceable undertaking that it would bring this about directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">The obligations imposed on Radio 2UE as conditions of its public broadcasting licence were to protect the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Mr Laws earned substantial amounts of money for himself through his commercial agreements using its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">That made it all the more incumbent on Radio 2UE to ensure that Mr Laws did not contravene the conditions of the licence again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">While I accept that both the Authority and Radio 2UE have approached the matter with good faith and in an attempt to serve what they perceive to be the public interest, I am of opinion that they have not adequately focused on the significant violations of the public trust placed in Radio 2UE which it breached through allowing Mr Laws' misbehaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">The 13 instances were not isolated contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">They followed from a history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">The Parliament enacted the 2006 amendments, containing the civil penalties and enforceable undertaking provisions, in order to be able to provide a mechanism to deter and stop conduct of the kind in which Mr Laws had previously engaged in misusing his and Radio 2UE's privileged position under its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">The first two contraventions should fall into the range which the Authority and 2UE have selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">There is no evidence that Radio 2UE or Mr Laws had contravened the disclosure standard between August 2006 and 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">The second contravention was more serious because of the earlier realisation, after the first, of the need to make a disclosure announcement, but overall the agreed penalties are within a range that make them appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">Had the independent reviewer's report for that period been read properly and promptly, it would have revealed to Mr Mott or Mr Rufhus, or others at Radio 2UE at that time, that Mr Laws had failed to comply with the disclosure standard twice on 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">In addition, the internal monitor should have drawn attention to these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">The Authority and, I infer, Mr Mott and Mr Ruhfus received the independent reviewer's report on 18 October 2007, the date of the third and fourth contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">But there is no evidence of when on 18 October that report was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">It is not possible to find whether its receipt by Mr Mott and Mr Ruhfus on that day would have enabled Radio 2UE to take steps to prevent the third and fourth contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">Each was a clear, easily recognisable contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">I am of opinion that each was serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">The remaining 9 contraventions should have been prevented had Radio 2UE appreciated from the 18 October independent reviewer's report that the new compliance system had not worked and it had once again breached the Act and the disclosure standard, as well as the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">Given the stage which the acquisition had reached, the threat of Radio 2UE being found to be in breach of its licence and the enforceable undertaking also would have impelled immediate action by Mr Mott, if not his superiors in Southern Cross Broadcasting to ensure that Mr Laws complied with the disclosure standard in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">Contraventions 5, 6 and 7 all occurred on 24 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">Contraventions 5 and 6 involved two different sponsors, Toyota and Byron Bay Beveridges that were referred to in one talk back conversation between Mr Laws and a listener.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">There was no extenuating circumstance for either contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">Mr Laws appeared to have considered that he could devise his own rules for compliance with the disclosure standard by ringing a cow bell at the mention of a sponsor's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">However, that could not satisfy the requirement of cl 7(3) to make a disclosure announcement using one of the six prescribed verbal formulas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">The contraventions were clear, serious and inexcusable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">These contraventions were at a higher level than the lower end of the range, even after allowing for all the mitigating factors relied on by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">In addition, contravention 7 involved three mentions of Hamilton Island in the one conversation with another talk back caller without any disclosure announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">Again, I am unable to see any extenuating circumstance that suggests that this was not a serious contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">Its seriousness was compounded two days later in contravention 8 when this segment was replayed, without any disclosure announcement, as a highlight of Mr Laws' programs during the preceding week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">In my opinion contravention 8 was a very serious contravention because Radio 2UE used a recording.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">Thus, it was not a case of a spontaneous on-air error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">Anyone connected to Mr Laws' program who selected this segment for repetition, must have known that Hamilton Island was a sponsor and there was no disclosure announcement for any of its 3 mentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Thus, the republication of contravention 7 in contravention 8 was reckless conduct by Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Contravention 9 involved another use by Mr Laws or Radio 2UE of the cow bell as a substitute for compliance with cl 7(3) of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">By this time, Mr Laws had committed 8 previous contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">The use of the cow bell did not satisfy in any way the obligation to make a disclosure announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">There were no extenuating circumstances to reduce this serious breach to the lower end of the range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">Contraventions 10, 12 and 13 all occurred on Mr Laws' last day as a presenter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">Contravention 10 was not as clear cut as the others, however, Radio 2UE accepted that it had been made out by Mr Laws mentioning the names of the two majority shareholders in his sponsor, Roche Group Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">This connection was between Mr and Mrs Roche and their companies' products or services was not as blatant or obvious as the other contraventions involving the use of well known brand names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">I consider that this contravention is one that can reasonably be seen as falling within the range of the agreed penalty, notwithstanding that it was the tenth breach of the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">Contraventions 11 and 12, however, were both egregious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">Callers mentioned various sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">Mr Laws and Radio 2UE made no attempt to comply with the requirement to make appropriate disclosure announcements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">These failures had no extenuating circumstances and, in my opinion, were each a serious contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">Indeed, contravention 12 involved the mention of 5 of Mr Laws' sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">Contravention 13 was a very serious, deliberate contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">It expressly flouted the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">I am comfortably satisfied that there was no justification or excusable circumstance for contravention 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">Nor do I regard the agreement to a penalty for it to constitute a significant mitigating circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">It was the fourth contravention on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">It was blatant and a direct challenge to the Authority, the Act and the disclosure standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">The imposition of a penalty of $10,000 for contravention 13 would be seen by the community, with every justification, as a minor slap on the wrist for a deliberate flouting of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">If a presenter can deliberately behave as Mr Laws did in contravention 13 and the commercial radio licensee receive a penalty at the lower end of the range, no-one will be deterred from committing substantial infractions of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">That behaviour calls for a very substantial, if not the maximum, penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">THE TOTALITY PRINCIPLE 
 In arriving at the appropriate pecuniary penalties to be imposed for multiple contraventions, a court must first assess individual penalties for each contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">But, before finalising the civil penalty orders the Court must look at and, if need be, adjust the resulting total effect of the individual orders it is considering, so as to produce an overall set of civil penalty orders appropriate to deal with all the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">In other words, the totality principle applicable in passing criminal sentences should be adapted to apply to the overall civil penalty orders imposed on a contravenor: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, applied in a civil penalty context by Stone and Buchanan JJ in Mornington Inn (2008) 168 FCR at 408 [91]; see too at 397-398 [42]-[45]; see also per Gyles J who dissented in the result but not on the principle's applicability at 386-387 [5]-[9].</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">Where contraventions are separate offences in law but are substantially contemporaneous and connected, the Court must have regard to the totality principle in fixing the individual penalties: L Vogel &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Anderson (1968) 120 CLR 158 at 168 per Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">The Court must also have regard to the relative closeness of the relationship in time and character of the offences (or contraventions): Mill 166 CLR at 64.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">Some aspects of the totality principle are not as easily applied to pecuniary penalties as to sentences of imprisonment using the method preferred in Mill 166 CLR at 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">The High Court suggested its preference for making sentences wholly or partially concurrent, where practicable, to reflect the appropriate overall punishment in the ultimate total result rather than lowering individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate to reflect the fact that a number of sentences were being imposed: Mill 166 CLR at 63; RH McL v The Queen [2000] HCA 46 ; (2000) 203 CLR 452 at 457 [15] - [16] , 462-464 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ, 476 [75] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see too Lukatela 223 FLR at 15-16 [75]-[77] where I discussed the principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">Concurrent pecuniary penalties cannot be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">So the Court must consider the overall burden imposed by the set of pecuniary penalties to assess whether, in totality, the burden is greater that is warranted by the contraventions in all of the circumstances: see too s 205F(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">In fixing the penalties below I have had regard to the totality principle as explained above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">FIXING THE PENALTIES 
 I am satisfied by the confidential evidence of Mr Mott that Radio 2UE is a substantial company in its own right and is capable of paying any penalty which the Court might impose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">In addition, Radio 2UE has entered into a deed of cross guarantee with its ultimate holding company, Fairfax Media Limited, and thus has adequate resources with which to pay any penalty in the whole range and costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">I have also had regard to the significant advertising revenues of Radio 2UE, disclosed in Mr Mott's confidential evidence, in forming the view that Mr Laws must have been valuable to Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Mr Laws was obviously a presenter on whom Radio 2UE relied on to attract to attract audiences and advertising review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">He had over 50 years exposure and experience of public broadcasting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">I find that Mr Laws attracted a significant proportion of its total advertising revenue earnings, having regard to what he himself earned and Mr Mott's evidence that he was the station's presenter with the most commercial agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">The Authority's report in respect of the 13 contraventions identified Byron Bay Beer and Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited as advertisers on Radio 2UE as well as sponsors of Mr Laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">There was no evidence that the other sponsors, the subject of the contraventions also advertised on Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">The imposition of a civil penalty is, like the imposition of a sentence, a matter of instinctive synthesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">Here, there are no guides other than the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act and the disclosure standard to use in ascertaining the object of imposing pecuniary penalties under s 205F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">The public interest in ensuring that a commercial radio broadcasting licensee adheres to the conditions of their licence is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">The repeated and substantial breaches by Radio 2UE as a licensee, should not be treated with a benign punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">I am of opinion that having regard to the cumulatively damaging features of the repeated contraventions, civil penalties for most of them in a higher range than that chosen by the parties are the only ones which would appropriately meet the justice of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">Radio 2UE took no action at all on Mr Laws' last day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">The failure to institute a proper system earlier led to the continuing and serious breaches by Radio 2UE of the conditions of its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">But, Mr Laws' conduct itself was the central element of the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">Any system is only as good as its weakest part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">Mr Laws was a known recidivist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">The independent reviewer detected his initial two breaches and reported them in time to enable preventative steps to be taken before 24 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">Even then, Radio 2UE was aware of contraventions 7 and 8 by 26 October 2007 and reported them to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">Yet there was no evidence of what steps it took then, after becoming aware that its internal monitor had failed to prevent, first, the initial contravention, let alone its republication, as had its training of Mr Laws and his production staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">And, Radio 2UE was aware, at least constructively, from the independent reviewer's report of contraventions 5 and 6 involving Mr Laws' "rant" and the inappropriate, seething resentment in his 29 October "disclosure" that, he treated the disclosure standard with contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">The pecuniary penalties must put a price on the contraventions that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by Radio 2UE as the contravenor and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act and the disclosure standard: see CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">I am of opinion that there will be a substantial deterrent effect given to licensees by the penalties I will impose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">The kind of contraventions that Mr Laws caused Radio 2UE to make and its inadequate attention to the requirements of compliance must be deterred if the purpose of the disclosure standard is to be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">I am satisfied that there will not be a repetition of Mr Laws' conduct only because he has retired from presenting his program on Radio 2UE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">Radio 2UE has not had to deal with or test whether Mr Laws would now comply under its new measures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">However, I am also satisfied that Radio 2UE has implemented genuine and satisfactory changes to its compliance systems that are likely to lead to compliance by its other presenters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">And, I am also satisfied that no bad faith was involved on the part of Radio 2UE's management or Mr Mott.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">Licensees must be deterred from taking lackadaisical attitudes to compliance with their statutory and licence obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">Takeovers and changes of control in ownership occur on a fairly regular basis in the broadcasting industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">Such events are not an excuse for a licensee to fail to comply with the Act, the disclosure standard or its licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">If Mr Mott and all the senior management were too busy to protect the very basis which generated Radio 2UE's entitlement to earn income, namely its licence, then a clear message must be sent by condign penalisation of that attitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Such an attitude is unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">It demonstrates an inattention to the public trust in commercial radio broadcasting licensees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">The privilege of being able to use the public radio spectrum cannot be allowed to be abused in the way that occurred here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">The history and circumstances of the contraventions call for the Court to make clear how important licensees must regard the privilege which their licence gives them and the heavy responsibilities imposed by their licences if they are to continue to benefit by exploiting a public right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">Under s 205F(3), I have had regard to all relevant matters, including, but not limited to the nature and extent of the contraventions, the mitigating factors put before me and particularly the circumstances in which they took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">Because this is the first time in which a civil penalty has been considered in the context of the Act, I have given anxious consideration as to whether I should, despite my views, accept the submissions of the parties as to the appropriate range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">For the reasons I have given, the considerations for imposing a civil penalty under the Act include but are not limited to those in the contexts of other legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">The purposes for imposing civil penalties under legislation such as the Trade Practices Act are different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">They involve contraventions of laws of general application by persons engaged in trade or commerce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">Here, under the Act, the contraventions attracting liability to the imposition of a civil penalty involve the breach by a licensee of conditions of a licence granted by law to engage in activity for profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">The licensee is in a position of public trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">I have taken into account the mitigating factors that Radio 2UE and the Authority have referred to in their submissions and evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">I accept that Radio 2UE, since the contraventions came to light, has co-operated with the Authority and genuinely regrets its conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">However, the penalty must punish the significant breaches of public trust that occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">In addition, Radio 2UE did not ensure that the new system was working after it gave the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">No explanation has been given why Mr Ruhfus did not learn of the contraventions (other than contraventions 7 and 8) or of what he did to satisfy himself, as general manager of Radio 2UE, that it was, through Mr Laws, complying with the Act, the disclosure standard and the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">I have not punished Radio 2UE for breach of the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">But its existence, the circumstances in which it was given and its proximity in time to the contraventions should have ensured that someone in Radio 2UE checked whether the new compliance system actually worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">It is an aggravating factor that no adequate steps were taken by Radio 2UE, even in that context, to check or ensure that the new system was working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">A licensee cannot assume that nothing will go wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">Far less could Radio 2UE have assumed this with Mr Laws who, after all, had been the cause of giving the enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">Radio 2UE had a duty to be vigilant to ensure compliance with its licence, the disclosure standard and the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">Instead, Radio 2UE committed the contraventions when it permitted Mr Laws to use its licence knowing that, first, Mr Laws had a history of previous contraventions of the disclosure standard (cp Weininger 212 CLR at 640 [32] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ), secondly, he had an antipathy to the disclosure standard, thirdly, he had six very substantial commercial agreements and, fourthly, he made frequent references during his program to his sponsors, their products and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">But for Radio 2UE's mitigating conduct, I would have imposed higher penalties for these serious breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">Rather than making declarations, I consider that it is appropriate to state each contravention and the pecuniary penalty I have imposed for it in the formal orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">The Authority, licensees and the public will be able to relate the two together in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">In my opinion, these contraventions should be marked with severe and substantial pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">The agreed penalties are, overall, but with the three exceptions I have noted, manifestly inadequate, indeed, negligible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">To be sure, the Parliament intended that ss 140A and 205F would be a means of dealing with contraventions not calling for more severe sanctions such as suspension of a licence or its cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">The Chairman of the Authority aptly described the obligation to comply with the disclosure standard as going to the heart of a licensee's obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">Having had regard to all relevant matters under s 205F(3) of the Act, I am of opinion that the following penalties should be imposed: Date Contravention Penalty 
 5 October 2007 1 $ 10,000 5 October 2007 2 $ 10,000 18 October 2007 3 $ 20,000 18 October 2007 4 $ 20,000 24 October 2007 5 $ 25,000 24 October 2007 6 $ 25,000 24 October 2007 7 $ 30,000 26 October 2007 8 $ 45,000 2 November 2007 9 $ 35,000 30 November 2007 10 $ 10,000 30 November 2007 11 $ 35,000 30 November 2007 12 $ 45,000 30 November 2007 13 $ 50,000

 SCHEDULE 
 
 Contravention 1: Friday 5 October 2007, approx 11.26am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">No disclosure announcement was made that Hamilton Island Enterprises Ltd was a sponsor of Mr Laws at the time of an on-air mention of Hamilton Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">Facts 
 
Mr Laws was interviewing Meredith Whittle, the mother of a child who was assisted by the Starlight Foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">Towards the end of the interview Mr Laws said:
 
 "It's a terrific thing that you have done, and the Starlight Foundation, and I'm glad that they supported you and you must let us know if we can help you in any way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">I mean I'm here for a little while yet...have you been to Hamilton Island?..</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">Do you want to go to Hamilton Island?</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">" 

 
Mr Laws ended the interview without making a disclosure announcement and the interview was followed by a commercial for Hughes Clothing Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">Directly after the commercial at 11:28, approximately 90 seconds after the mention, Mr Laws says: 'I did tell you that Hamilton Island are sponsors of mine, didn't I?</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">Contravention 2: Friday 5 October 2007, approx 11:40am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">No disclosure announcement was made that Hamilton Island Enterprises Ltd was a sponsor of Mr Laws at the time of an on-air mention of Hamilton Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">Facts 
 
A caller, 'Andrew', referred to the interview forming part of contravention 1 and said:
 
 "I've been listening for the last seven years...particular little stories and things like the thing you just did for that last lady, sending her off to Hamilton Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">You know, it's what brightens your day up...you know, we're going to miss that when you go, really miss that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">" 

 
Mr Laws replied: 'I'll miss doing it believe me' and did not disclose the sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">No disclosure announcements for this sponsor were made for the rest of the program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">Contravention 3: Thursday 18 October 2007, approx 10:06am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">No disclosure announcement was made that Byron Bay Beverages Pty Ltd was a sponsor of Mr Laws at the time of an on-air mention of Byron Bay Beer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">Facts 
 
Mr Laws read an email from a listener and said: 'You also go on to say here, Des, I can't find Byron Bay Beer anywhere in Central Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">Do they sell it in my state?</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">' Mr Laws commented on the email but there was no disclosure announcement regarding his sponsorship agreement with Byron Bay Beverages Pty Ltd.
 
Mr Laws had conducted a live-read commercial about Byron Bay Premium Ale at 9:59am, immediately before the 10am news and station advertisements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Contravention 4: Thursday 18 October 2007, approx 10.28am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">No disclosure announcement was made that Byron Bay Beverages Pty Ltd was a sponsor of Mr Laws at the time of an on-air mention of Byron Bay Beer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">Facts 
 
Mr Laws was talking to a caller, 'Mark', who, after saying: '...we're halfway through a fantastic, doing it really tough holiday on Hamilton Island' then said: 'I'm disappointed about the fact that I can't find Byron Bay bitter in the fridge at the bottle shop down here'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">Shortly after this statement Mr Laws said: 'We'll see what we can do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">But enjoy Hamilton Island.</sentence>
