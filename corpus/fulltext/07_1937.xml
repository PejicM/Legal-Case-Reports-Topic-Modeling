1 This proceeding arises out of an application for a determination of native title made by Vera Florence Ketchell, Ernie Douglas Raymont, Stanley Thomas Morta, Elsie Elizabeth Go Sam, Yvonne Shirley Canendo, Ena Eileen Gertz, Grace Kidner, Margaret Patricia Raymont and Ila Elizabeth Kidner, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Ngadjon-Jii People.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The respondents are the State of Queensland, the Cairns City Council, the Eacham Shire Council and Ergon Energy Corporation Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The claim area comprises approximately 13 287 hectares of land and waters within various reserves, environmental parks and national parks around Atherton, Mareeba and Cairns in Far North Queensland, including the southern portion of Wooroonooran National Park, including Broken Nose, the South Peak, the North Peak and the Northwest Peak of the Mt Bartle Frere, the Topaz Road National Park, the Malanda Falls Conservation Park, two parcels of land reserved for quarry purposes, and an island in the middle of the Russell River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The claim area is comprehensively defined as the 'Determination Area' in Schedule 1 of the Minute of Consent Order, filed 14 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">BACKGROUND OF THE APPLICATION: 
 
3 The application for determination of native title was filed in the Court on 14 October 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That application was amended pursuant to an order of the Court on 19 June 2006 and an amended Claimant Application was filed on 29 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">That amended Claimant Application forms the basis of the consent determination proposed to be made today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The agreement reached between the parties and filed in the Court on 14 November 2007 confers exclusive and non-exclusive rights on the Ngadjon-Jii People to use and enjoy the land and waters in the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 The agreement between the parties is subject to the Court being satisfied that it has the power to make orders in terms of those sought and the Court being satisfied that it is proper to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">POWER OF THE COURT: 
 
6 Pursuant to s 13 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act), applications for the determination of native title may be made to the Federal Court in relation to areas for which there is no approved determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Part 3 of the Act sets out the rules for making such applications to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">7 Part 4, Division 1C of the Act provides that some or all of the parties involved in a native title proceedings may negotiate an agreed outcome for that application or part of that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Section 87 of the Act allows the Court, if it is satisfied that such an order is within its power, to make an order in, or consistent with, the terms of the parties' written agreement without holding a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">8 Where the Court makes an order in which a determination of native title is made, s 94A of the Act requires the Court to set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Section 225 provides:
 
 'A determination of native title is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area ) of land or waters and, if it does exist, a determination of: 
 
 
 (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 
 (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 
 (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this Act); and 
 
 (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease --- whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 


 CONSIDERATION OF AGREEMENT AND DRAFT DETERMINATION: 
 
9 In considering whether it is appropriate to make the order that the parties seek, I have had the benefit of the Summary of Connection Material report of Dr Sandra Pannell, Anthropologist, prepared in September 2007 and filed as an annexure to the affidavit of Martin Edwin Ellis Dore on 7 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">That summary document of Dr Pannell's earlier anthropological report material was prepared at the request of the solicitor for the applicant and the North Queensland Land Council to assist the Court in considering the agreement between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 In order to establish that there are today native title holders, it must first be established that, at the time of sovereignty, a society of persons bound together by observance of traditional laws and customs existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In identifying the Ngadjon-Jii People, Dr Pannell's summary report explains that:
 
 '[7] The claimants describe the native title claim group as the Ngadjon-People (or 'Ngadjon) 'tribe'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The 'tribe' consists of two sub-groups or 'clans', the Barron River and the Russell River clan groups, which, at any given moment in time, are also associated with specific family names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">While each of the two riverine groups is traditionally associated with different areas within Ngagjon-Jii territory, the claimants identify their traditional rights and interests as communally vested in the group at the tribal level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Whether a 'people' or a 'tribe', the Ngadjon-Jii claimants also see themselves as quintessentially 'rainforest Aborigines'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 
 

11 The Ngadjon-Jii People's traditional entitlement to ownership of the ancestral lands and waters derives from their physical, cultural and spiritual connection to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In reviewing the Ngadjon-Jii People's claimed physical connection, Dr Pannell explains:
 
 '[55] Ngadjon-Jii patterns of physical occupation, both historically and in the contemporary period, can be characterised as multi-sited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Thus, while some individuals lived at Top Camp and Gulkagulka , other Ngadjon-Jii people, during the same period, occupied camp sites in 'the Jungle' (in Malanda), at the junction of the Ithaca and North Johnstone Rivers, on farms at Glen Allyn, at Bunjabilli (aka 'Bottom Camp' in reference to Top Camp, at Lamins Hill) at Butcher's Creek, and at the camp at the Malanda Falls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 ... 
 [57] Twentieth-century anthropological and linguistic accounts provide further evidence of the general physical connection of the Ngadon-Jii people to the claimed areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">For example, based upon fieldwork with Ngadon-Jii informants in the 1930s and again in the 1970s, including several of the claimants' immediate forebears, Norman Tindale, recorded that "Ngatjan territory was virtually all in rainforest extending from Atherton in the west to near Innisfail on the coastal plains".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">' 
 

12 In reviewing the Ngadjon-Jii People's claimed cultural connection, Dr Pannell continues:
 
 '[58] For the claimants, language is identified as one of the distinctive cultural features of their group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 ... 
 [59] The Ngadjon dialect was acquired from the Ngadjon-Jii relatives in the parental and grant-parental generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Knowledge of the claimant group's traditional language is actively transmitted to younger generations of Ngadjon-Jii people through daily instruction, and through the production of written texts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 ... 
 [63] The cultural connection between Ngadjon-Jii people and named places within the claimed area is illustrated by the personal names of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Claimants, whether old or young, posses language names, which, among other things, refer to rainforest faunal or floral species or to named places on Ngadjon-Jii country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">' 


 
13 In reviewing the Ngadjon-Jii People's claimed spiritual connection, Dr Pannell writes:
 
 '[65] Ngadjon-Jii people maintain a spiritual connection to the claimed lands through the transmission of oral narratives about 'Dreamtime' beings and Ngadjon-Jii ancestors, known as the 'old people'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The language-named Storytime or 'Dreamtime' places acknowledged and protected by the Ngadjon-Jii people point to the claimants' belief that their traditional lands and waters constitute a sentient landscape, forever occupied by both Dreaming and ancestral spirits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">' 
 

14 Dr Pannell states in her report that the entitlement of the Ngadjon-Jii claimants to possession of the claim area is recognised by members of neighbouring Aboriginal groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Dr Pannel's summary report notes:
 
 '[38] The traditional connection and identity of the Ngadjon-Jii claimants is acknowledge [sic] by members of neighbouring Aboriginal groups, including other dialect speakers of the Dyirbal language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Prior to lodging the native title determination application, senior Ngadjon-Jii people convened several meetings with elders from neighbouring groups, including, Mamu, Majaanji, Kairi Yidindji, Gordonvale Yidindji, Dulabed Yidindji, Dugulbara Yidindji, Malanbara Yidindji, Barbaram and Jirrabal tribal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">At these meetings, senior Aboriginal members from each of these groups agreed that the claimants possessed a traditional connection to the areas claimed by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">' 
 

15 This same report then concludes:
 
 '[39] In addition to these group meetings, the anthropologist researching Ngagjon-Jii peoples' native title interviewed elders and others members of neighbouring Aboriginal groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">On the basis of these interviews, and also based upon the outcome of the group meetings, it is the opinion of the research anthropologist that there is a widespread consensus in the regional Aboriginal community, that the claimants are; (1) Ngadjon-Jii, and (2) that they are the 'Traditional Owners' of the lands and water under claim by the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' 
 

16 Dr Pannell's report contains many examples in which the Ngadjon-Jii People have maintained their connection to the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">These include: occupying the remnant forests or otherwise utilizing them to avoid being taken to missions that operated during the first half of the twentieth-century; working on local farms whilst occupying traditional dwellings; engaging in occupations carried out on the country, such as timber cutting or fossicking; and in some cases, returning to Ngadjon-Jii country upon release from government missions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">17 According to Dr Pannell's report:
 
 '[92] With the exception of some of the members of the Parkinson family, who reside on Palm Island, at the time when the native title claim was lodged, practically all of the Ngadjon-Jii claimants lived either in Malanda or in Atherton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">' 


 
18 I am satisfied, based on all of the information available to the Court, that the Ngadjon-Jii People have a long-standing and continuing connection to the determination area under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional laws observed by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">TERMS OF THE PROPOSED ORDER: 
 
19 The proposed order, which is consistent with the terms agreed by the parties, recognises that the Ngadjon-Jii People, as the holders of the native title in the determination area, are entitled to the exclusive and non-exclusive use and enjoyment of the land and waters in accordance with their traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">20 The proposed orders further recognise other interests in the determination area and the relationship of those interests with the native title interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The proposed order contains other provisions, required by the Act, which it is unnecessary for me to set out here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">21 It is a cause of great satisfaction when native title claims are settled through agreement rather than through protracted litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I am most pleased to observe that the number of native title determinations by this Court, which have been reached by consent, has dramatically increased in recent years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This suggests that governments and other parties are increasingly aware of the benefits of negotiated settlements of native title claims, which otherwise have the potential to be lengthy, costly and divisive in the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">22 I am satisfied that the Court has power to make a determination in the terms proposed by the parties by agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Such an order determines under the laws of Australia that native title exists in the determination area according to the traditional laws and customs of the Ngadjon-Jii People.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This is recognition of what has long been held by the Ngadjon-Jii People.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">23 For the above reasons, I have concluded that it is proper to make the order sought by the parties to give effect to their agreement, and I now make that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.</sentence>
