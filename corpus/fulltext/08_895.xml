<sentence id="s0">
 
1 There are two sets of costs that must be allocated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">First there are the costs thrown away by reason of the trial having to be adjourned on the second day of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Second are the costs of the resumed trial in which both the claim for infringement and the cross-claim for revocation were dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The costs of the adjournment present no difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Both sides were dilatory in filing their evidence --- there was an order that the trial be on affidavit and a timetable for filing affidavits was set and ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In particular, the parties were late in filing the evidence of their experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Part only of the blame lies with the respondents who took some time to get their house in order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Nevertheless the trial was adjourned because the respondents filed the third affidavit of their expert, Mr Hunter, on 13 November 2006, being the first day of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Upon reading the affidavit it was apparent the applicants would require time to investigate what Mr Hunter said and, most likely, prepare answering material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That is how events turned out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicants did apply for the adjournment and the order was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondents must pay the costs thrown away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The more interesting question is what should be done with the costs of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In my reasons I suggested that each side should bear its own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Hess SC who with Ms Marks appeared for the respondents said in a detailed written submission that the claim and cross-claim should be treated as one case and, since the applicants failed in their infringement action, they should be treated as having failed in the entire case and thus ought pay the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 This rather bold submission was not made under cover of a fall back position, for example, that there should be an apportionment of costs on an issue by issue basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">As that was not pressed I will leave it out of account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I note in passing, however, that I see no difficulty in holding that the incidence of costs should be decided on an issue by issue basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Most often an apportionment of that kind will produce a better result than will the blunt application of the "costs follow the event" rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In this case, however, I will confine my attention to whether the respondents should get all the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">5 This action exhibits an undesirable feature that has become standard fare in patent litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Most patent cases begin with an infringement action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The common practice is for the defendant to deny infringement and cross-claim for the revocation of the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Often there is no merit in the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is brought for tactical reasons, for instance to put pressure on the applicant in the hope of achieving a satisfactory settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The idea is that an applicant might not be willing to run the risk, however slight, of having his patent, which is often a very valuable right, struck down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 It is difficult to know how to deal with this problem, the seriousness of which should not be understated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">First of all, patent litigation is expensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Judges share part of the blame for very often they do not impose adequate restraints on the manner in which the parties conduct their case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">But judges are usually not in a position early on to work out which claims are hopeless and make appropriate orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">That only becomes apparent at trial, by which time it is too late to do much about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">7 Second, patent litigation is not just expensive, it also takes up a great deal of judicial time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">If courts are required to expend scarce resources dealing with hopeless cases, other litigants will suffer as their cases are necessarily put off in the meantime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 I do not know what motivated the respondents to bring their cross-claim for revocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I do know it wholly lacked merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr Hess said that the grounds for invalidity were limited and based on reasonable grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The pleaded grounds for invalidity were hardly limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The grounds were want of novelty, lack of inventiveness step, not a manner of manufacture and not a patentable invention being a mere collocation of previously known integers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In written submissions filed shortly before the trial all these grounds of invalidity were pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In the end no evidence was called to support them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This simply will not do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Were I to award the respondents any costs in these circumstances it would be to condone their action, if not encourage others to follow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9 I propose to allow the costs to lie where they fall, as I had indicated I was minded to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In other cases it may be necessary to go further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The usual order for bringing a hopeless case is to require the losing party to pay indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Sometimes even that might not be enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In patent litigation the parties are often large organisations that will not sufficiently feel the pain of an indemnity costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In those cases (I do not suggest this one) the proper order might be to require the legal practitioner to himself bear the costs, coupled with an order that the practitioner shall not be entitled to recover those costs from his client, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I fear that only orders of that kind will deter parties from bringing hopeless cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">But, these are issues for another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
