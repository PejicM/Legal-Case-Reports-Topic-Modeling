<sentence id="s0">
 
1 By amended application filed on 5 March 2007 the applicant seeks judicial review of a personal decision made by the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("the Minister") on 1 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">At that time the Minister was the Honourable Senator Amanda Vanstone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Since then both the title of the portfolio, and the holder of that title, have changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The decision under review was to cancel the applicant's absorbed person visa on the basis that he did not pass the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">That decision was taken pursuant to s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
3 The applicant appears to have been born on 1 May 1966 (although there are discrepancies in his formal records).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He is a citizen of the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He arrived in Australia in August 1977 together with his parents, sister and younger brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On arrival he was granted permanent residency status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 It is a matter of contention between the parties as to which type of visa the applicant held from 1 September 1994, being the date on which the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 (Cth) came into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant submits that pursuant to those Regulations he was granted a transitional (permanent) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Minister submits that whilst those Regulations had the effect of continuing the applicant's permanent residency status, pursuant to s 34 of the Act the applicant was also deemed to have been granted an absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That was on the basis that he had been a non-citizen in the migration zone prior to 2 April 1984, and before that date had "ceased to be an immigrant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 On 26 March 2001 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of Victoria to one count of manslaughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He was sentenced to a term of nine years' imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole period of seven years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Prior to that, he had a lengthy criminal history going back at least as far as 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 By letter dated 29 June 2006, addressed to him at the Fulham Correctional Centre, the applicant was served with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In that letter he was also informed that if a decision were made to cancel his absorbed person visa, s 501F(3) of the Act would operate to automatically cancel his transitional (permanent) visa as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He was provided with the opportunity to comment upon certain matters and to provide the Minister with any further information that he wished to have taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He was told that any response must be received by close of business on 24 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 On 11 July 2006 Victoria Legal Aid, acting on behalf of the applicant, requested an extension of time for the preparation of his submission in response to the Minister's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">On 18 July 2006 the Department wrote to Victoria Legal Aid granting the applicant an extension until 21 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 16 August 2006 Victoria Legal Aid provided a detailed submission on the applicant's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 On 12 October 2006 the Department wrote to Victoria Legal Aid setting out further information that it considered relevant to the notice of intention to consider cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Department invited the applicant to comment upon that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On 24 October 2006 Victoria Legal Aid responded on his behalf to that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 As already indicated, on 1 December 2006 the Minister made a decision to cancel the applicant's absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The decision also restated that s 501F(3) operated to cancel automatically any other visa held by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Several days later the applicant was transferred from Port Phillip Prison to immigration detention, where he has remained ever since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">THE MINISTER'S DECISION 
 
10 The Minister made a series of findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">She found that the applicant had a substantial criminal record, and that by reason of the sentence imposed for manslaughter, and s 501(6) and (7)(c) of the Act , he did not pass the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">11 The Minister considered various matters set out in Ministerial Direction No 21, being a Direction under s 499 of the Act ("the Direction").</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Direction is said to provide guidance to decision-makers in determining whether to refuse or cancel a visa under s 501.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">If a non-citizen does not pass the character test, decision-makers are required to have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The primary considerations are:
(a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community;
(b) the expectations of the Australian community; and
 
 (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

12 In relation to primary consideration (a), the factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the continued stay of a non-citizen include the seriousness and nature of the conduct, the likelihood that it may be repeated and whether visa cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Direction states that a person's previous general conduct and total criminal history are highly relevant to assessing the risk of recidivism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 In relation to primary consideration (b), the Direction posits that the Australian community expects non-citizens to obey Australian laws while in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Where a non-citizen has breached, or there is a significant risk that they will breach this trust, or where the non-citizen has been convicted of offences, it may be appropriate to cancel the visa held by such a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 In relation to primary consideration (c), the Direction makes it clear that the best interests of the child are to be taken into account only where the child is, or would be, less than 18 years of age at the time the decision is intended to come into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In general terms, the child's best interests will be served if he or she remains with his or her parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, countervailing considerations which may point to the child's best interests being served by separation from the non-citizen include, but are not limited to, any evidence that the child has been abused or neglected, or suffered or experienced any physical or emotional trauma arising from the non-citizen's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">15 Under the ambit of "other considerations" the Direction includes factors such as the extent of disruption to the non-citizen's family, business and other ties to the Australian community, marriage to or a relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident, and the degree of hardship which would be caused to immediate family members lawfully resident in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Direction provides that factors such as these should be taken into account but generally be given less individual weight than the primary considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">16 In relation to primary consideration (a), the protection of the Australian community, the Minister took into account the seriousness and nature of the applicant's conduct, the likelihood that such conduct might be repeated, and the question of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">She found that the conviction of manslaughter involved an offence which was very serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">She took into account the fact that in addition to his manslaughter conviction he had a number of other convictions for various offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">These included convictions involving acts of physical violence and the use or possession of weapons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Minister regarded these matters as weighing in favour of cancelling the applicant's visa, and said that she gave them great weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">17 The Minister went on to note that the applicant was first convicted in January 1982 "when he was 15 years old", and stated her belief that he could be considered to be a recidivist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">She observed that the applicant had a number of positive urine results while in prison, indicating that he was using cannabis even while serving his sentence for manslaughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">She took into account information that the applicant had provided concerning various medical conditions and pain management which she regarded as going some way towards explaining his use of cannabis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">However, the fact that he continued to use illicit drugs while in prison suggested that he was not completely able to control his substance abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Minister said that she believed that there was a chance that the applicant may re-offend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That weighed in favour of cancelling his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">She said that she gave moderate weight to that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">18 The Minister said she gave no weight at all to whether cancelling the applicant's visa would act as a deterrent to other non-citizens who might engage in similar activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 When it came to primary consideration (b), the expectations of the Australian community, the Minister said that non-citizens were expected to obey Australian laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">However, she also accepted that the Australian community would have some compassion for the applicant's situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He had entered Australia in 1977, aged 11, and had lived here continuously since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Moreover, his immediate family, including his son, lived in Australia and he had had little or no contact with relatives overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Minister concluded that in view of the seriousness of his offence and the extent and nature of his criminal history the community would expect his visa to be cancelled and that he be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">That expectation weighed in favour of cancelling his visa, and the Minister said she gave moderate weight to that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">20 Finally, the Minister had regard to primary consideration (c), the best interests of the applicant' s 14 year old son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">She noted that prior to his incarceration the applicant did not live with his son or have responsibility for his day to day care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">However, the Family Court had ordered that he should have joint responsibility with the child's mother for his long term care, and that he should have regular contact with his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">21 The Minister accepted that there was a strong bond between the applicant and his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">She also accepted that he was a committed father who was determined to do all he could to ensure that his son had a successful future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">She accepted that his removal from Australia would have a detrimental effect on his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">She added, however, that she had also considered the possibility that the applicant may re-offend and the negative effect upon his son if this were to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">She concluded that it would be in the best interests of the applicant's son that his father remain in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">She said that that consideration weighed against cancelling his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">She said that she gave great weight to that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">22 The Minister said that she also took into account, under the rubric of "other considerations" the hardship and distress that would be caused to the applicant and his immediate family if he were to be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She said that she gave that consideration moderate weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">23 The Minister concluded her reasons for decision by stating as follows:
 
 
 "31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I considered all relevant matters including, an assessment against the character test as defined by s501(6) of the Migration Act 1958 , Ministerial Direction 21 under s499 of that Act and all other evidence available to me, including evidence provided by Mr MOORE and on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In reaching my decision I concluded that the seriousness of Mr MOORE's conviction for Manslaughter and his criminal history, and, to a lesser extent, the expectations of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Having given full consideration to all of these matters, I decided to exercise my discretion to cancel Mr MOORE's visa under s501(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" 
 
 
 GROUNDS OF REVIEW 
 
24 The applicant relied upon three grounds in support of his application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">They are:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Applicant was at the time of the decision of the Respondent not the holder of an absorbed person's visa; rather he was the holder only of a transitional (permanent) visa which was not cancelled by the decision of the Respondent nor taken to be cancelled by operation of sub-s. 501F(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Respondent failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred by s. 501(2) of the Act , or alternatively acted in excess of jurisdiction, by failing to take into account as a primary consideration, or at all, the best interests of ... the child of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Respondent failed to accord to the Applicant procedural fairness by refusing on 11 August 2006 to allow to the Applicant a further extension of the time in which to respond to a notice of intention to consider cancellation dated 29 June 2006 despite the illness and hospitalisation of the lawyer who was then assisting the Applicant with his proposed response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">" 
 
 
 
 GROUND 1 
 
25 Put simply, ground 1 contends that the applicant was never the holder of an absorbed person visa and, accordingly, the Minister's decision to cancel that visa was a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">26 The only issue to be considered in relation to this ground is whether the applicant had "ceased to be an immigrant", within the meaning of that expression in s 34(2)(b) of the Act , before 2 April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">If, as the applicant submitted, he had not ceased to be an immigrant as at that date, he would not be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa on 1 September 1994 (the date when the former system of entry permits came to an end, and was replaced by the new visa system).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">27 The applicant submitted that he had not "ceased to be an immigrant" because he had, as at 2 April 1984, accumulated a substantial number of convictions for serious offences which were antithetical to his having been absorbed into the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">28 In support of that contention the applicant relied primarily upon the judgment of French J in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In that case, Mr Johnson, a citizen of New Zealand came to Australia in 1981 at the age of six.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He eventually acquired a lengthy criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">On 19 December 2002 the Minister purported to cancel his "special category visa" under s 501(2) of the Act on the basis that it was reasonably suspected that he did not pass the "character test".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Mr Johnson submitted that he held an "absorbed person visa" pursuant to s 34 , and not a "special category visa".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He submitted that the decision of the Minister to cancel a non-existent visa was therefore affected by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">29 French J accepted that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He held that the Minister's decision to purportedly cancel a visa not held by the applicant was a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">30 His Honour discussed in some detail the authorities that bore upon the constitutional question which underpinned the criteria for an absorbed person visa, namely under what circumstances does a non-citizen who has entered Australia cease to be an immigrant for the purposes of the immigration power under s 51(xxvii) of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He referred to Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63 ; (1908) 7 CLR 277; R v Macfarlane; Ex parte O'Flanagan [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518; Ex parte Walsh; Re Yates [1925] HCA 53 ; (1925) 37 CLR 36; O'Keefe v Calwell [1949] HCA 6 ; (1949) 77 CLR 261; Koon Wing Lau v Calwell [1949] HCA 65 ; (1949) 80 CLR 533; and R v Forbes; Ex parte Kwok Kwan Lee [1971] HCA 14 ; (1971) 124 CLR 168.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">His Honour also referred to a number of decisions of the Federal Court to the effect that the statutory designation of a person as a "prohibited immigrant" or "unlawful non-citizen" could prevent his or her absorption into the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">31 French J then discussed more recent High Court authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He referred to Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391, a case which concerned the extent of the naturalization and aliens power under s 51(xix) of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Taylor, who faced deportation on account of criminal conviction, was a non-citizen whose absorption into the Australian community was not in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He had come to Australia in 1966 as a child, and been educated and made his home in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">However, he had not taken out Australian citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The Minister had purportedly cancelled his "absorbed person visa" which Gaudron J suggested reflected a concession that he had been completely absorbed into the community prior to April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">That, of course, was one of the requisites for an "absorbed person visa".</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">32 In Ex parte Taylor the High Court held, by a four to three majority, that Mr Taylor, as a British subject, was not an alien but a subject of the Queen of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">As such the power to cancel a visa under s 501(3) of the Act could not apply to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">33 Ex parte Taylor was effectively overruled in Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 72 ; (2003) 218 CLR 28 in relation to the time from which British subjects entering Australia would remain as aliens for constitutional purposes notwithstanding their absorption into the community and the ending of their status as immigrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">As in Ex parte Taylor , the question of absorption was not an issue in Shaw .</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">34 Importantly for present purposes, in Shaw Callinan J (at [183]) accepted that the commission of serious crimes against the community may be inconsistent with a person's absorption into the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He referred to Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Te [2002] HCA 48 ; (2002) 212 CLR 162 in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">He noted, however, that Mr Shaw had been living in Australia for more than twelve years before his first conviction which occurred when he was still a child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">His Honour concluded that, in those circumstances, Mr Shaw had been absorbed into the Australian community by the time he came to the notice of the criminal courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He added that he would not regard that first conviction, occurring as it did when Mr Shaw was so young, as putting him beyond the community of ordinary Australians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">35 It was in the light of these authorities that French J, in Johnson , identified (at [46]) the factors relevant to whether a person has been absorbed into the Australian community (and has therefore "ceased to be an immigrant") as including the following:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The time that has elapsed since the person's entry into Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The existence and timing of the formation of an intention to settle permanently in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The number and duration of absences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Family or other close personal ties in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The presence of family members in Australia or the commitment of family members to come to Australia the join the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Employment history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Economic ties including property ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Contribution to, and participation in, community activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Any criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">" 
 
 

36 French J noted that this list of factors was plainly not exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Rather, he said it illustrated "the multi-dimensional character" of the judgment involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">In his Honour's view, all the relevant factors, other than the time that had elapsed since the Johnson family's move to Australia, pointed strongly to the proposition that the family had become part of the Australian community as at 2 April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Although Mr Johnson's criminal record was extensive, it only began in 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Accordingly, it had little or no bearing upon whether he had ceased to be an immigrant by April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">37 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Moore, in the proceeding before me, that, in accordance with the authorities, his criminal record prior to 1984 was such that it precluded him from having been absorbed into the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">As a result, he had not "ceased to be an immigrant" within the meaning of s 34(2)(b) of the Act , and therefore had not acquired an absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">That in turn meant, using the reasoning of French J in Johnson, that the Minister had cancelled a non-existent visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">If that were so, s 501F(3) would have no application to this case because, as is implicit in the reasoning of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 230 ALR 370, that section can only be invoked in circumstances where a valid visa has been cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">38 In order to fully appreciate the nature of the applicant's submission, it is necessary to set out in some detail Mr Moore's criminal history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It appears that at some stage, probably in 1981, he was convicted in the Children's Court in Melbourne on six counts of theft of a motor vehicle, three counts of unlicensed driving, five counts of burglary, and nine counts of theft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">He was also convicted of one count of discharging a missile with intent to injure and one count of setting off fireworks without permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The exact date of his convictions before the Children's Court is unclear, having been blanked out of the criminal history report set out in the application book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">However, it is clear that Mr Moore appealed to the County Court from whatever orders were made in the Children's Court and was sentenced by the County Court on 22 January 1982 to 18 months' probation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">39 The criminal history report then records that on 13 January 1984 he was fined $100, in default five days youth training centre, on one charge of using indecent language in a public place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Finally, on 27 February 1984 he was dealt with at the Oakleigh Magistrates Court on charges of assault with a weapon, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, unlawful assault and wilful damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">He was fined a total of $600.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">40 The applicant built up a lengthy criminal history after 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">However, that is of only limited relevance when it comes to considering whether he had "ceased to be an immigrant" within the meaning of that expression in s 34(2)(b) as at 2 April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">41 It is somewhat ironic that the applicant contends that his criminal record was so bad, as at 2 April 1984, that he had not been absorbed into the Australian community, while the Minister contends that, in reality, the offences which he had committed by that date were by no means so serious as to warrant that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The positions normally taken by the applicant and the Minister in cases involving cancellation of visas on character grounds are quite the reverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">42 In any event, the Minister has proceeded throughout upon the basis that Mr Moore had an absorbed person visa as at 1 September 1994, having satisfied the requirements of s 34(2)(b) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That was the stance initially taken by the applicant as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However, he no longer maintains that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">43 In effect the only basis put forward in support of the applicant's contention that he had not ceased to be an immigrant as at 2 April 1984, and did not qualify for an absorbed person visa, was his criminal record as at that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Whatever may be the merits, or otherwise, of treating a criminal record as an indication that a person has not been absorbed into the community, I am satisfied that Mr Moore's record, at the relevant time, was by no means so bad as to lead to that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He was, after all, only 15 years old when the County Court matters were dealt with, and still only 17 at the time of the proceedings in the Oakleigh Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">None of the offences led to a custodial sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">They do not strike me as having been so serious as to warrant the conclusion that the applicant had not ceased to be an immigrant by 2 April 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">44 I therefore reject the applicant's contention that he does not now, and never has, held an absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It follows that the Minister's decision to cancel that visa operates by law, pursuant to s 501F(3) of the Act , to cancel also his transitional (permanent) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">GROUND 2 
 
45 The applicant contends that the Minister constructively failed to exercise her jurisdiction by failing to take into account, as a primary consideration, or at all, the best interests of the applicant's child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">46 There is no substance to this contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The Minister said that she gave primary consideration to the best interests of the child, which she regarded as a factor weighing against cancelling the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">She said that she gave great weight to that consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">There is nothing to suggest that she did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">47 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Minister must have paid only lip service to the best interests of the child, otherwise she would not have come to the decision that she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In support of that submission counsel referred to Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">There the Full Court held that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had failed to treat the best interests of the children as a "primary consideration" in its determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">48 In Wan , it was said to be of particular significance that the Tribunal had failed to identify anywhere in its written reasons for decision what the best interests of the children indicated that it should decide with respect to the application for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It was also noted that the Tribunal had failed to describe the best interests of the children as a "primary consideration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">49 Neither of those factors is present in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Minister plainly gave detailed attention to the best interests of the applicant's son, which she accepted favoured non-cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">She recognised that this was a primary consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">She said she gave it "great weight".</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">50 Counsel for the applicant relied, in particular, upon the following extract from the Full Court's judgment in Wan (at [32]):
 
 "An identification by the Tribunal of what the best interests of Mr Wan's children required, and a recognition by the Tribunal of the need to treat such interests as a primary consideration, would not have led inexorably to a decision by the Tribunal to adopt a course in conformity with those interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That is, even had the Tribunal concluded that the best interests of the children indicated that Mr Wan should be granted a visa, it was legally open to it to refuse to grant Mr Wan a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Provided that the Tribunal did not treat any other consideration as inherently more significant than the best interests of Mr Wan's children, it was entitled to conclude, after a proper consideration of the evidence and other material before it, that the strength of other considerations outweighed the best interests of the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">However, it was required to identify what the best interests of Mr Wan's children required with respect to the exercise of its discretion and then to assess whether the strength of any other consideration, or the cumulative effect of other considerations, outweighed the consideration of the best interests of the children understood as a primary consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">" 
 

51 In my view, there is nothing in this passage which supports the applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The balancing process described above accords precisely with the approach that the Minister herself adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">52 In truth, Ground 2, and the applicant's submissions in support of that ground, seek merely to have this Court engage in merits review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">That the Court cannot do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">GROUND 3 
 
53 The applicant's argument in support of Ground 3 relied almost entirely upon the decision of Allsop J in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In that case his Honour set aside a decision by the Minister to cancel the applicant's visas, namely an absorbed person visa and a transitional (permanent) visa, because the applicant had been denied procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">54 In Sales the applicant was given only 14 days to respond to a letter hand delivered to him on 8 August 2006 together with a copy of the Direction that set out, over some 11 pages, the matters that the Minister regarded as relevant to her determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The letter also included a number of other documents, such as extracts from the Act , the applicant's criminal history, pre-release reports of various dates, parole reports and a copy of the sentencing judge's remarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">55 Allsop J took into account the fact that the applicant in Sales was not a well-educated man.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">He also inferred that his family were not "people of wide or deep resources", or otherwise of significant education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">His Honour said that it was clear that the task at hand for the applicant and those concerned with his welfare was likely to be a difficult one because of the seriousness of the crime for which he had served 18 years in prison, namely a particularly callous and brutal murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">To require him to put forward in a coherent fashion a response to the Department's letter in the space of 14 days was unrealistic and plainly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">56 However, the case of Mr Moore can, in no way, be equated with Sales .</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">As previously indicated, Mr Moore was served with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his absorbed person visa no later than about 5 July 2006 (seven days after the date on which the letter was sent).</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">He was told that any response must be received by 24 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">57 Had matters rested there, the applicant would have had reasonable grounds for complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Nineteen days is scarcely an improvement over the 14 days regarded as inadequate in Sales .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">However, on 11 July 2006 Victoria Legal Aid requested an extension of time within which to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">On 18 July 2006 the Department granted an extension until 21 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Thus the applicant was given more than six weeks to provide a response to the Minister's notice, a period I regard as reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">58 Indeed, the applicant's position was actually stronger than this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">On 12 October 2006 the Department wrote to Victoria Legal Aid inviting comment on matters it considered relevant to the notice of intention to consider cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">On 24 October 2006, Victoria Legal Aid responded to that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">There was nothing to suggest that the applicant could not have added anything further to his earlier submission, in support of his claim to be permitted to retain his absorbed person visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">In fact the Department's letter of 12 October 2006 stated, after inviting the applicant to address the matters specifically drawn to his attention for comment, that he:
 
 " ... may also wish to provide other information that he considers should be taken into account when a decision is made whether to cancel his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">" 
 

59 In my view, the applicant was given ample opportunity to respond to the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">He was not denied procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Accordingly, Ground 3 is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">CONCLUSION 
 
60 For the reasons set out above, none of the three grounds in support of the application for review has been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">It follows that the application must be dismissed, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.</sentence>
