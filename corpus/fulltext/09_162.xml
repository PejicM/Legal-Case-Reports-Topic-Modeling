 BUCHANAN J: 
 This is an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ("the FMCA") ( SZMTC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1424).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">She arrived in Australia on 7 November 2007 and on 20 December 2007 applied for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The application was refused by a delegate of the Minister on 25 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 19 March 2008 the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT") for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In a decision handed down on 26 August 2008 the RRT affirmed the delegate's decision to refuse to grant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 15 September 2008 the applicant filed an application in the FMCA seeking judicial review of the decision of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant failed to appear when the matter came before the FMCA on 7 October 2008 and the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application due to the non-appearance of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 9 October 2008 the applicant sought to have the orders made on 7 October 2008 set aside but on 13 October 2008 the FMCA found there was no arguable case to justify setting aside the earlier orders and dismissed the application with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The judgment of the FMCA on 13 October 2008 gave consideration to the reasons which were given by the applicant for her failure to appear on 7 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Federal Magistrate concluded that the applicant's evidence to the FMCA was not truthful and that no weight should be placed on the applicant's affidavit or oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Despite finding that the applicant had, accordingly, not provided a satisfactory explanation for her failure to attend the hearing on 7 October 2008 the Federal Magistrate went on to consider whether there was an arguable case to be tried and concluded that the applicant was able to demonstrate "no more than a disagreement with the findings and conclusions of the Tribunal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I agree with submissions made on behalf of the Minister that the orders made on 13 October 2008 were interlocutory in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Leave was required to appeal against those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Moreover, any application for leave to appeal was required to be filed within 21 days (see O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal was made some eight weeks after the orders in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Under O 52 r 15 an extension of time in relation to an ordinary appeal, not requiring leave, may be granted "for special reasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It has been held that no lesser test should be employed when considering an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal (see Deighton v Telstra Corp Ltd [1997] FCA 1568 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Aust Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 ( "Sharman" ) at [20]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A special reason is one which takes the case out of the ordinary (see Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 and Vu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 59).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In Sharman , Lindgren J distilled the requirements to be met in such circumstances in the following way (at [20]): 20 In order for the Court to allow further time for the filing and serving of an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, the following conditions must be satisfied:
 There must be a satisfactory explanation for the delay beyond the seven-day time limit fixed by O 52 r 10(2)(b) (see, for example, Deighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd (unreported, Full Court, 17 October 1997));
 The application for leave to appeal must have such prospects of success as not to render the extending of time an exercise in futility .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Since the test for the granting of leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment is that the decision must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court, and that substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong ( D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-400), in principle the question on an application for an extension of time is whether this test has sufficient prospects of being satisfied, to warrant granting the extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In practice, the debate and treatment of the 'arguable error' question on an application for an extension of time, will be no different from what the debate and treatment of it would be on the application for leave to appeal itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Since an applicant for extension of time within which to appeal as of right must show 'special reasons' (O 52 r 15(2)), nothing less should be required of an applicant for an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal ( Deighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd , above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">) 

 
[For leave to appeal from a judgment of another court O 52 r 5 fixes 21 days rather than 7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In support of her application for an extension of time the applicant filed an affidavit which suggested, apart from alleging error on the part of the RRT, that the FMCA did not give her a chance to explain her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There is no substance in that allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Furthermore, despite the fact that directions were made on 17 December 2008 that the applicant file written submissions in support of her application she did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">At the hearing of her application I asked the applicant why she had not acted earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">She said that she had left everything to her migration agent but Ms Rayment who appeared for the Minister told me that no registered migration agent has been notified to the Department as acting for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In my view special reasons to grant an extension of time have not been established and the application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal is liable to be dismissed upon that basis alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Moreover, in my view there is no prospect that leave to appeal would be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The draft notice of appeal contains the following three grounds: Refugee Review Tribunal had bias against me and did not make fair decision for my application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I clarify all my points at the hearing of the Federal Magistrates Court, but the Judge did not consider my application fairly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Judge refused my application at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It is not fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I am Falun Gong practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I will be persecuted if I return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I believe that my application was not considered reasonably by the Judge at the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I even did not receive my green book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 (Original emphasis removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">) 

 The test for whether leave to appeal would be granted is that stated in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 namely, whether the decision at first instance was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision at first instance was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In my view that test is not met in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The grounds of appeal do not identify any jurisdictional error in decision or processes of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Identification of such an error is the minimum condition to be met to render an appeal to this Court useful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Mere allegations of bias are insufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">No other assistance was provided by the applicant which might overcome this basic defect in her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The fact that leave to appeal would not be granted is a further reason not to grant an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In the circumstances the appropriate order is that the application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There is no reason why costs should not follow the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I will order that the application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.</sentence>
