1 This interlocutory dispute arises out of a claim by the respondent, Allphones Retail Pty Ltd ("Allphones"), that documents produced by it to the Court on 20 December 2006 pursuant to a Notice to Produce filed by the applicant, Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd ("Hoy") on 28 November 2006, are subject to legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The original list of documents over which privilege is claimed is attached to the affidavit of Mr Lloyd of 5 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">As originally framed, the claim covered 37 documents, but the claims in respect of documents 1, 35, 36 and 37 are no longer pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In his second affidavit of 25 May 2007, Mr Lloyd attached a schedule which described in a general way the documents in relation to which the privilege is claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The documents relate to the period from 14 June 2006 to 22 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The claims for privilege in this case are to be determined by common law principles, and not pursuant to the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), because the Notice to Produce has not been issued for the purpose of adducing the documents into evidence: see Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at 59-63 (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The evidentiary basis for the claim of privilege in respect of each particular document has been set out in detailed evidence in the form of three affidavits sworn by the solicitor for Allphones, Mr Lloyd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">There has been no cross-examination on those affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">BACKGROUND 
 
4 In his affidavit of 5 April 2007, Mr Lloyd records that the principal proceeding relates to a dispute between Allphones as franchisor and Hoy as franchisee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Beginning in early 2006, Hoy raised a number of issues and complaints with Allphones concerning questions as to exclusive territory; the loss of the original franchise agreement by Allphones; the execution of a new tax invoice agreement; the payment of money as a contribution to the original fit-out of the premises; and calculations as to payment to Hoy of a commission on sales and connections of mobile telephones and other goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">During the period of March to August 2006, efforts were made to resolve these issues and complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The present litigation was commenced on 1 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 In May 2006, Allphones became aware of facts which it says indicated that Hoy may have been engaging in fraudulent conduct, namely manually unbundling mobile telephones to a particular mobile telephone network provider, selling the unbundled phones at a higher price and failing to disclose this conduct and the difference in price to the purchasers of the telephones, the network providers or Allphones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Allphones sought legal advice in relation to the dispute in mid-June 2006 and, after consultation with its legal advisers, obtained statements from various persons in relation to the suspected fraudulent conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 On 28 August 2006, Allphones served Hoy with a notice of its intention to terminate the franchise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">As a result, on 1 September 2006, Hoy began the present proceedings, seeking orders restraining Allphones from terminating the franchise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 On 28 November 2006, Hoy served Allphones with a Notice to Produce, category 6 of which reads:
 
 'With respect to the respondent's allegation against the applicant for fraud contained in the respondent's notice of intention to terminate franchise agreement ... all files, memoranda, file notes, minutes of meetings and any other documents relating to the respondent's investigations, enquiries and consideration up to and including 28 August 2006'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 

8 After making reasonable inquiries and reviewing the documents relating to the dispute, Mr Lloyd identified 37 documents which fell within the scope of category 6 of the Notice to Produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He then made a preliminary assessment and determined that each document was subject to legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">As mentioned above, the claim of privilege is no longer maintained in respect of four documents, namely 1, 35, 36 and 37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 30 January 2007, three more documents were produced to the Court in answer to category 6 of the Notice to Produce, each of which were said to be privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In his affidavit of 5 April 2007, Mr Lloyd refers to each document in dispute and gives a concise description as to its nature, date of creation and the basis on which privilege is claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 In his affidavit of 25 May 2007, Mr Lloyd gives specific evidence concerning the relationship between Allphones and Bartier Perry as its legal advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">This evidence specifically addresses how each of the documents in question came into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The affidavit also states that, prior to June 2006, Allphones was an existing client of Bartier Perry and that on 14 June 2006 Mr Rook, a partner of that firm, had a telephone conversation with that National Franchise Manager of Allphones in which he was informed of its dispute with Hoy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Shortly after this conversation, the firm was retained by Allphones to provide legal advice on an ongoing basis in relation to the dispute, and in an email dated 14 June 2006 there is an express reference to 'potential franchisee litigation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In addition to this, Mr Lloyd later refers to information given to him by other partners of the firm, namely Mr Berner and Mr Creais, giving further particulars as to the creation of the documents in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 It is clear from the foregoing that Mr Lloyd made detailed inquiries of Messrs Rook, Berner and Creais, together with officers of Allphones, including its Chief Executive Officer, National Franchise Manager, New South Wales State Manager, Chief Financial Officer and employees, prior to making the claim for legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He was satisfied, on the evidence from those inquiries, that the reason each of the documents was brought into existence was for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice or assistance or for use in reasonably anticipated litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">11 A further aspect of the background to these proceedings is the aborted attempt to mediate the dispute and the correspondence between the parties which ensued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Birch, the solicitor for Hoy, swore an affidavit on 5 October 2006, in which he deposes that he was instructed in early March 2006 to act for Hoy in its disputes with Allphones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">After attempting to contact Allphones directly, Mr Birch on 20 April 2006 requested the Office of the Mediation Advisor to appoint a mediator, which was duly done on 27 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Allphones resisted the mediation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It sent an email to the mediator on 4 May 2006 in effect denying there was a dispute, and later confirmed that it would not attend a mediation conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 22 May 2006, Mr Birch wrote to Allphones raising matters for consideration, and this was followed by further correspondence in which the possibility of terminating the existing franchise agreement and executing a new agreement was raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">On 6 July 2006, Allphones requested a meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On 22 August 2006 a meeting took place at which Mrs Hoy, Mr Birch, Mr Harkin, the National Franchise Manager of Allphones, and Mr Llevski, NSW State Manager for Allphones, attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the course of that meeting, Mr Harkin referred to the allegation that Hoy had been engaging in fraudulent conduct, and stated that Allphones had obtained statements and affidavits from various people to support the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mr Harkin also stated that, under clause 9 of the franchise agreement, Allphones was entitled terminate that agreement without issuing notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Despite this assertion by Mr Harkin, Allphones served Hoy on 28 August 2006 with a notice of its intention to terminate the franchise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">On 1 September 2006, Hoy commenced these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">CHALLENGE TO DOMINANT PURPOSE 
 
12 Allphones submits that the documents are privileged because they were prepared for the dominant purpose of seeking legal advice or assistance or for use in reasonably anticipated litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The claim is that, while the documents may have been prepared also for other subsidiary commercial purposes, those other purposes were subservient to the purpose of obtaining legal advice, assistance or use in litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That latter purpose is claimed to have been 'dominant' in the sense that it was the most influential or paramount purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">13 Hoy submits that Allphones, as the party asserting the claim of privilege, bears the onus of proof of the elements of the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">To this end, it relies on the comments of Spigelman CJ in Sydney Airports Corp Ltd v Singapore Airlines [2005] NSWCA 47 at [3] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Hoy also argues that it is not sufficient to discharge this onus for the party claiming privilege simply to depose an affidavit making conclusory assertions as to the purpose for which the documents were brought into existence together with a statement about the category of legal professional privilege which applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">To this end, it relies on the decision of the Full Court in Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCAFC 337 ; (2004) 142 FCR 185 at [12] - [16] (per Black CJ and Emmett J) and [144]-[145] (per Allsop J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Hoy submits that Allphones has not discharged its onus because Mr Lloyd's affidavits are insufficient and because, after having regard to non-privileged correspondence between the parties, it is clear that the dominant purpose for the creation of the documents was a commercial one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It argues that the documents were created in the course of an ongoing business relationship between the parties, rather than for the dominant purpose of legal assistance or obtaining material for use in legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">14 Hoy further submits that it is a fair inference that an important purpose for most of the communications was the formulation of a commercial strategy or the taking of steps in the future management of the franchise relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">If this inference were correct, the documents would go far beyond the scope of communication which was merely for the dominant purpose of legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Although legal advice may have been contemplated or involved, Hoy contends that Allphones has not shown, nor should it be inferred, that the communications were made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance in litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Hoy submits the evidence indicates that the communication was for the purpose of dealing with the dispute by progressing through dispute resolution procedures required by the franchise agreement, which requires the parties to resolve disputes commercially in order to enhance their future business relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In short, it is highly improbable, having regard to the context, history and evidence in the matter, that the communications were made for the dominant purpose of contemplated legal proceedings because such proceedings could not properly be contemplated before commercial decisions, strategies and dispute resolution procedures had been conducted, agreed upon or dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The documents for which privilege is claimed are said to be within the latter category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">15 The evidence of Mr Lloyd has also been attacked in submissions by Hoy on the ground that it simply expresses the views of the lawyers involved and does not discharge the onus of proof as to the purpose of the creation of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">For example, Hoy says there is no witness from Allphones to give evidence of primary thought processes as to why the communications came into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Consequently, there is no clear paramountcy of purpose, it is said, which establishes that the documents were created in the course of giving or seeking legal advice or assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Contrary to the position of Mr Lloyd, Hoy argues that the communications were created for non-privileged purposes, namely preparing material for procedural meetings between the parties, investigating and preparing material for comment or response from Hoy, or investigating facts to formulate a business or commercial strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">16 The time at which the question of legal professional privilege falls to be determined is when the document is brought into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The question as to whether privilege will attach to a document is usually determined by considering the purpose which the creator of the record had in mind when it was brought into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The best evidence would normally be evidence given directly by the person creating the document as to the purpose of its creation, provided his or her evidence is specific, not inconsistent with the contents of the document and not weakened by cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">However, matters such as the factual context and the contents of the document are also relevant in determining the question of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Evidence based on information and belief can be given as to purpose of a document's creation by someone who did not create it, provided that he or she specifies the source of that information and belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In many cases it may well be impractical to expect that the author or originator of every document should swear an affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 In circumstances where parties to a dispute are taking steps to resolve the dispute through discussions, meetings and/or procedures required by an agreement, it will not necessarily be the case that the 'dominant purpose' of records created during that period of consultation is other than the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Where there is a legal retainer in existence during a period when the disputed documents came into existence, it is prima facie reasonable to conclude that a party is seeking legal advice and guidance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The mere fact that parties are communicating with respect to such dispute resolution procedures does not mean that litigation is not reasonably anticipated during that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">A party may well, quite reasonably, contemplate such litigation, and thus continue taking steps to obtain material for use in the event that negotiations break down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Often legal guidance may be necessary as to how the proceedings are to be carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Such a situation is not, of itself, inconsistent with the creation of documents for the dominant purpose of legal advice or assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In many cases parties will, for the sake of attempting to maintain a valuable business relationship, seek to negotiate a resolution to a dispute and work towards a modus vivendi , while at the same time contemplating and preparing for litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">18 In this case the thrust of Hoy's submission is that, on the available evidence, the dominant purpose of the documents is not to seek legal assistance but rather to work out an overall strategy to determine the ongoing commercial relationship of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The reality is that parties to a dispute may have dual purposes, in which the seeking of legal advice remains the dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Indeed, the notion that there may well be other purposes, such as managerial or commercial objectives, which account for the existence of a record is inherent in the 'dominant purpose' test itself: see Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No 6) [2005] A.C. 610 at 650 (per Lord Scott of Foscote).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">19 In considering whether a particular document is privileged, it is helpful to consider the documents as a whole and have regard to the whole stream of communications passing between the parties, rather than to examine each document in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This is because, by standing back and looking at the overall course of communication across a period of time, a picture may emerge which characterises the nature and purpose of each individual communication more clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Such an approach enables a decision to be made more confidently as to whether a specific document is privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In this case, the overall course of communication, when considered in its factual context together with the contents and form of the documents and the specific evidence provided by Mr Lloyd as to the provenance of the documents, is sufficient to persuade me that the dominant purpose for the creation of each of the documents presently in dispute was to obtain legal advice or assistance or to be used in anticipated litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Accordingly, I am of the view that each of the communications is privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In particular, I do not accept the submission that the steps taken towards the dispute resolution procedure provided for in the franchise agreement is sufficient to displace the strong, detailed and specific evidence supporting the claim for privilege, especially when considered in light of Allphone's retainer of Bartier Perry on 14 June 2006 and the commencement of litigation on 1 September 2006 by Hoy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">WAIVER BY DISCLOSURE 
 
20 Hoy also claims that by a letter of 7 July 2006 Allphones waived legal professional privilege in any legal advice referred to in that letter by disclosing the substance of that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">21 The letter in question is from Mr Donnellan, Chief Executive Officer of Allphones, to Mr Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The relevant passage reads:
 
 'There are serious matters which need to be discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Your client will be given an opportunity to respond to those matters and failure to do so will result in immediate termination of its franchise agreement, based on the advice of our lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">)
 

22 Drawing upon the reasoning of Gyles J in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at 119, Hoy submits that this passage constitutes a waiver of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice provided to Allphones, and that in these circumstances any privilege which vests in the legal advice to which the above passage refers has been waived by disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">23 In my opinion, the reference to a position which is 'based on' legal advice does not, in the circumstances of this case, amount to a sufficient disclosure of that legal advice as to amount to a waiver of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Neither the conclusion, nor the gist, nor even any of the content of the legal advice is referred to or disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">All that is disclosed is that Allphones has obtained advice and has considered it as part of a basis for making a decision as to its future course of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The passage is consistent with Allphones having made an independent decision after reading the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Moreover, I do not consider that the use of a generalised reference to an extant piece of legal advice constitutes a use of that advice in such a way as to make it unfair or unreasonable not to disclose the full contents of that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I am of the view that no privilege which vests in any of the communications in dispute has been waived by disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">IMPLIED WAIVER 
 
24 Hoy further submits that, where a party raises an issue which would be unjust to litigate without access to records bearing on its state of mind, it has impliedly waived privilege in respect of the material on which that state of mind is based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Hoy argues that Allphones has impliedly waived privilege as to a number of the documents because, by electing to continue to require the performance of the franchise agreement from Hoy and by electing to pursue contractual and statutory dispute resolution procedures, Allphones has affirmed the agreement and waived its right to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This, it is said, puts in issue Allphones' state of mind, and thus impliedly waives privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Hoy also argues that by purporting to reserve its right of termination Allphones acted in bad faith and with the real purpose of negotiating more favourable terms in its franchise agreement with Hoy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Again, it is said, Allphones has put in issue its state of mind and thereby impliedly waived privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Hoy also submits that the implied waiver of privilege is also supported by that fact that Allphones has alleged fraudulent conduct against Hoy as a basis for termination of the franchise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">25 To support its contention, Hoy refers to the decision in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83, where Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed at 96 that in cases of implied waiver of legal professional privilege the question is whether fairness requires that the privilege should cease: see also Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 481 and 488 (per Gibbs CJ and Mason and Brennan JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The principle of implied waiver was expressed and applied by this Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341, where the Full Court at 354-356 decided that if a party makes an assertion as part of its case that puts the contents of otherwise privileged material in issue, or necessarily opens an inquiry into an issue which gives rise to an inconsistency between maintaining the privilege claim and making the assertion, the privilege is waived by implication: see also Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1; Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council (1939) 39 SR (NSW) 347.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">26 The difficulty in Hoy's submissions is that, in the present case, the issue of election is not raised by Allphones but by Hoy itself in section K of its Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Allphones, in paragraph 44 of its Further Amended Defence, simply denies the allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Similarly, the allegation of bad faith is an issue raised by Hoy and denied by Allphones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In any event, it seems to me that the allegation of fraud puts in issue the state of mind of Hoy and not that of Allphones, and consequently it cannot be unfair or inconsistent for Allphones to retain its privilege with respect to records relating to its own state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">As McClelland J said in United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd at 7 (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClelland J, 13 October 1981):
 
 '...before the privilege can be said to have been lost on this principle, one must at least be able to identify some element or feature of the claim made, or the evidence adduced, by the party otherwise entitled to the privilege , which would render reliance on the privilege unjust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">)
 

27 There is no unfairness, in my view, in maintaining the privilege claim by Allphones in these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It is not implicit in the denial of an allegation of bad faith that Allphones must in fairness make available otherwise privileged material relating to its state of mind simply because the other party has made the allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The position may be altered if Allphones were to positively assert and put in issue its state of mind by, for example, claiming that it had no reason to believe a certain matter existed or raising an issue of undue influence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">But that is not this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Such an allegation is the converse of this case, because Hoy, and not Allphones, has raised the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">28 Nor does the reasoning in Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council (1939) 39 SR (NSW) 347 assist Hoy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In that case, the plaintiff was asserting a right to claim damages under a statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The statutory context made it implicit in making the claim that the plaintiff had not effectively exercised an alternative right, and thus access to the plaintiff's material was necessary to challenge this implicit assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">That is not the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">29 For the above reasons, I do not consider there has been an implied waiver of legal professional privilege in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">QUARMBY AND SHEPHERD STATEMENTS 
 
30 On 3 July 2006, Bartier Perry, three weeks after it had been retained by Allphones, wrote to Mr Quarmby, a customer of Allphones, with a draft statement for his consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The statement was in the form of a standard witness a statement, apparently drawn up by the solicitors on instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It related to inquiries made in relation to the purchase of an unbundled mobile telephone from an Allphones store.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">31 On 15 August 2006, another draft statement was sent by Bartier Perry to a Mr Shepherd for his consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The covering letter was marked 'Private &amp; Confidential'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The statement relates to the observations and statements made at Allphones' store concerning 'unlocked phones'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">32 These documents were created and sent to Messrs Quarmby and Shepherd after Allphones retained Bartier Perry to give legal advice and assistance and shortly before the notice of its intention to terminate the franchise agreement was sent on 28 August 2006 and legal proceedings were commenced by Hoy on 1 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">33 Having examined the statements themselves, and taking into account the times at which they were created, I am satisfied that they were created for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal assistance or for use in litigation which was reasonably anticipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">34 The challenge to the privilege claim in respect of these two statements and related communications therefore fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">CONCLUSION 
 
35 All of the documents for which privilege is claimed by the respondent are privileged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The application for production is dismissed and, because the respondent has succeeded in substance, the applicant is to pay the respondent's costs of the application for production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.</sentence>
