 1 The plaintiffs, AMP Services Ltd (AMP Services) and Arrive Wealth Management Ltd (Arrive), are members of the AMP group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Arrive operates a financial planning business which it purchased from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on 28 June 2002 for around $9 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">AMP Services employs the financial advisers who work in the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The defendants were two of those advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In January 2004 the first defendant went to work for a competitor, Goldman Sachs JBWere Services Pty Ltd (GSJBW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The second defendant and other employees soon followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">So did many of Arrive's clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Within a matter of weeks a large proportion of Arrive's business was lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The plaintiffs allege that as a result the capital worth of the business diminished by about $4.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">They seek to recover that amount from the defendants (or to obtain from them an account of any benefits they have received from GSJBW) alleging three causes of action: (i) breach of contract -- relying on a post-employment restraint and confidentiality clause in each contract of employment; (ii) breach of statute -- ss 182 and 183 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth); and (iii) breach of fiduciary duty -- the equitable duties of good faith and to act in the employer's best interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2 To understand how this case has come about it is necessary to sketch briefly some of the background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">PwC's financial planning business provided financial planning and taxation advice to wealthy individual clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The first defendant, Ms Manning, a chartered accountant who also has academic qualifications in both business and financial planning, was a senior manager in the Melbourne office of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Ms Manning was a top-notch financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">PwC regarded her as having excellent business skills and as being an exceptional team leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">As we shall see she was also extremely ambitious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Other financial advisers working in the Melbourne office who formed a group headed up by Ms Manning were Kerry Ventura, Laurence McCarthy, Ben McGrath, James Hufton and the second defendant, Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">3 When it decided to purchase the business Arrive thought it necessary also to acquire key personnel who worked in the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">To this end the sale contract allowed AMP Services to nominate PwC employees to whom an offer of employment would be made and PwC promised to use reasonable endeavours to encourage those employees to accept the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Ms Manning was one of two employees who were nominated to receive an offer of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This was followed on 20 June 2002 by an offer to Ms Manning to take charge of what was now Arrive's Melbourne office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">To induce Ms Manning to accept the offer, PwC agreed to pay her $150,000 with one half payable when she commenced her new employment and the balance payable 18 months after the completion of the sale of the business to Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In the event, that day was 1 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">4 Ms Manning accepted the offer of a position with AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There are several provisions of her employment contract to which reference should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The contract is set out in a letter to Ms Manning from Neil Farrington, the Managing Director of Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The opening paragraph of the letter reads: "Conditional upon completion of the sale of PricewaterhouseCoopers [sic] financial planning business to AMP, I am very pleased to offer you employment with AMP Services Limited (AMP) on the following terms".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There then follow the terms, the most important of which are:

 b) Solicit, interfere with or endeavour to entice away any employee of AMP, or 
 c) Counsel, procure or otherwise assist any person to do any of the acts referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Our Agreement 
 
 
 
 This letter and any attachments will represent the whole agreement between AMP and you regarding your employment, once it has been signed by you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This letter supersedes and merges all previous negotiations, understandings or representations between AMP and you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 This agreement is confidential and may not be disclosed by you to any other person, other than for the purpose of obtaining professional legal or accounting advice, without the prior approval of AMP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" 
 

5 The members of Ms Manning's group were also employed by AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Only one, Ms Harkness, is a defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Her background is in law and economics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">While at PwC Ms Harkness was an adviser in the financial planning section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Initially, her position with AMP Services was as a financial adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">She was promoted to senior financial adviser in December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The terms of her employment contract are similar to those of Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Only two terms need be mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">First, the contract allowed Ms Harkness to terminate her employment on two weeks' notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Second, there was a post-employment restraint and, third, a confidentiality clause in the same terms as those contained in Ms Manning's contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">6 It will be noticed that the promisee under each employment contract is AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Yet it is Arrive that sues for the breach of each contract to recover its alleged loss of $4.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The difficulty with such a course is obvious and was recognised by the plaintiffs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In their amended points of claim they allege that the benefit of the post-employment restraint and the benefit of other provisions of each contract are held on trust for Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In the alternative they contend that each agreement was made by AMP Services as agent for Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Those are the bases upon which Arrive asserts standing to sue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The allegation that several provisions of each contract are held on trust for Arrive has been admitted, although the defendants say that each post-employment restraint is "void and unenforceable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The admission makes it unnecessary to determine several tricky questions that would otherwise arise, including: (1) Whether each promise is capable of being held on trust; (2) Whether the intention to create the trust must be gathered from the contract itself or whether extrinsic evidence is admissible for this purpose: American Financial Corporation v Computer Sciences Corporation , 558 FSupp 1182 (D.Del, 1983); and (3) Whether the requisite intention must be that of both the promisor and the promisee: see the discussion in Restatement (Second) of Contracts SS302.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">7 The principal service provided by Arrive to its clients was investment and superannuation planning advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Its income was derived from fees charged for advice and commissions earned from the management of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The business was conducted from offices in most capital cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The largest office was located in the PwC building in Melbourne where Ms Manning was in charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The advisers in the Melbourne office were Ms Manning's group from PwC plus two additional advisers, Sam Gray and Andrew Walsh, who had been engaged in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">8 Ms Manning was Arrive's most successful adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Yet, she was dissatisfied with several aspects of Arrive's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">I will only mention a few of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In 2002 she was involved in a dispute with Mr Farrington about the quantum of bonus commission to be paid to herself and her group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The dispute was resolved, but not to Ms Manning's complete satisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Another matter was the structure of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">From the outset Ms Manning pressed for the introduction of a "self-employment" business model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Under this model clients would "belong" to an adviser and the income that was derived from that client would be split between the adviser and Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Ms Manning was of the view that unless this model was instituted it would not be possible to retain quality advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The model was often discussed, but nothing was done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Another sticking point was Ms Manning's concern about the addition of AMP "products" to the range of investments that clients were encouraged to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">She did not believe they were suitable for Arrive's clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This issue was never resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">9 An important feature of Arrive's business was the regular dealings between its advisers and major stockbroking firms, especially in relation to clients for whom Arrive managed a share portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In addition, there were cross-referrals of clients between Arrive and certain broking firms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Arrive had a particularly close relationship with one large broking firm, JBWere Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This was the continuation of a relationship that had begun when Arrive's business was run by PwC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As a result of this relationship Ms Manning came to know quite well several senior executives of JBWere including Marc Huinink, a senior investment adviser, David Evans, Head of Retail, and Chris Voigt, a senior investment adviser and Manager, Victorian Retail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">10 In mid-2003 JBWere and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc, a global investment bank, "merged" parts of their respective operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They established GSJBW as a new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The new company took over the broking and financial planning business formerly conducted by JBWere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Almost immediately GSJBW began to expand the financial planning side of the operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">11 Around the same time, Ms Manning started to think about leaving Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">She began looking at other opportunities that might be available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">She had even gone so far as to discuss her situation with an executive recruitment firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It is likely Ms Manning told some of her friends at GSJBW that she might leave Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In early October Mr Huinink provided Ms Manning with a character reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Ms Manning said that she had requested the reference to support her application for registration as a tax agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">She had lodged such an application and was required to provide evidence that she was a fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of taxpayers in income tax matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The character reference was capable of being used for that purpose, though if that were its principal purpose it would perhaps have been worded differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">12 From time to time in the middle of 2003 Ms Manning spoke with Mr Voigt, Mr Huinink and Mr Evans; whether separately or together is not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The topic of their conversations is a matter of controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Ms Manning says that the only matters discussed were business development opportunities and, later on, the merger between JBWere and Goldman Sachs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It may be accepted that these matters were discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The question is whether, as the plaintiffs assert, they also spoke about Ms Manning becoming an employee of GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I think that if this issue was raised, it was discussed only in passing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The evidence does not enable me to find that any detailed dialogue took place on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">13 On 24 October 2003 the "senior team" of Arrive met with Mr Voigt and Mr Evans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The meeting was arranged in an exchange of e-mails between Ms Manning and Mr Voigt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is helpful to set out the e-mails:

<sentence id="s137">
 kind regards

The meeting took place on the Friday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Ms Manning and most of her group, including Ms Harkness, were in attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Mr Gray and Mr Walsh were not invited to go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Ms Harkness' attendance was unusual in two respects: she rarely worked on a Friday and she was not part of Arrive's "senior team".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Nor, for that matter, was Mr Hufton, another attendee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Ms Manning explained that Ms Harkness was present because she was "seen as part of the more senior group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That does not, in my view, adequately explain her attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">14 A good deal of time at trial was taken up investigating what this meeting was about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">In their amended points of claim the plaintiffs allege that between 1 July 2003 and 20 January 2004 Ms Manning "encouraged or facilitated ... [other Arrive] employees to ... leave the employ of Arrive and [AMP Services] and join Goldman Sachs, by putting them in contact with the persons at Goldman Sachs with whom she was dealing," and that she "conspired with other employees of Arrive and [AMP Services] to divert Clients away from Arrive and to Goldman Sachs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The meeting is said to be a part of the conspiracy as well as an occasion on which Ms Manning encouraged or facilitated other employees to leave Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">15 The only direct evidence about the meeting was that given by Ms Manning and Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">No other attendee was called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It is unfortunate that on such an important issue I do not have the benefit of all the available evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">This was not the only event in respect of which the parties failed to call material witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">16 According to Ms Manning the point of the meeting was to explain how the newly created GSJBW was to operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Ms Manning said that she and her group were told that GSJBW would continue providing broking services, expand and develop its wealth management advisory division, offer advice in relation to financial planning, taxation and insurance matters, and add a "global dimension" to that side of its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">She denied being offered a position with GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">She said that at the time she had given no serious consideration to moving to the new firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Ms Harkness confirmed that no job offers were made, although she conceded that she left the meeting believing that there may have been an opportunity to move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">17 If this evidence be accepted then the meeting was little more than an ordinary business meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Yet there are some troubling aspects about the affair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Ms Manning admitted that it was unusual for almost her entire group to attend a meeting with brokers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I have already mentioned that Ms Harkness attended though she was not a senior adviser and did not attend the office on a Friday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Ms Manning sought to brush aside these matters by asserting that the merger was an important event that had the capacity to impact significantly on the affairs of Arrive's clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I am not sure that I accept that explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">If the meeting was so important then Mr Walsh and Mr Gray would have been in attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I believe it more likely that the meeting was (and perhaps was intended to be) a "sales pitch" by GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">This is how it was perceived by Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I also think that Ms Manning agreed to the meeting to discover what prospects there were at GSJBW for her and possibly her group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I suspect that Mr Voigt and Mr Evans had the same thing in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">18 Not surprisingly then a few weeks after the meeting Ms Manning received an offer of employment from Mr Evans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The terms of the offer are not in evidence but Ms Manning said that the terms were worthy of "serious consideration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">She also had in mind the possibility that if she went to GSJBW her group and Arrive's clients might go with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">For all practical purposes Ms Manning regarded the clients as her own: she had "[brought them] in the door".</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">But Ms Manning knew that she might be in trouble if she encouraged her clients and her group to move to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">So she sought advice from her solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The precise issues upon which advice was sought are to be found in her letter of instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The letter is undated but was written before she met her solicitor on 12 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The letter reads: 
 
 "Further to our telephone messages, I request assistance primarily with a review of Clause 11 (Post Employment Restraint) of my employment contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Obviously this matter is highly confidential and should not be discussed with anyone but myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 
 I am currently the Victorian Head and Senior Adviser of Arrive Wealth Management (a 100% subsidiary company of AMP) and am considering moving to Goldman Sachs JB Were (GSJBW) next year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I request your advice in relation to Clause 11 in this regard and the practicalities should staff and/or clients potentially choose to work with me at GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">
 
 Attached for your reference are the following: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">My employment contract and addendum letter/e-mails clarifying certain terms therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">A number of items of correspondence between myself and the Arrive MD regarding a disagreement as to my 2002 (calendar year) bonus entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I used PwC Legal for assistance with this matter which was finalised primarily in my favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Further correspondence regarding 2003 (calendar year) bonus terms which I did not sign the acceptance form for --- merely sending an e-mail noting that I could not endorse the significantly reduced bonus arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">
 
 
 
 I look forward to our meeting on Wednesday 12 th November at 10.00am at your office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 

The advice given by the solicitor is summarised in a letter dated 19 November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It was as follows: 
 
 "The executive should remain in place until after 31 December 2003 and if desired should then give notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 
 While in continuing employment there is no restraint on contacting clients to cement personal/professional relationships and as this is the Christmas Season, perhaps good reason to do so, if so minded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">
 
 Any communication of this kind should be bona fide, transparent and recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">
 
 While in employment there appears no restraint on exploring options elsewhere including sketching the sort of structure that it is considered would maximise the productivity both of the Executive and the Executive's pyramid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The structure should not be personalised but should be in the form of an organisation chart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Salaries and conditions of each position could be suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 Obviously the Executive should and would be meticulous and professional in performing all obligations to the existing employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 
 As any change would be likely to attract useful media attention, thought should be given to the source and wording of appropriate briefings and releases and also to their timing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">While this would be attended to primarily by others, the proposed wording should desirably be the subject of legal consideration to ensure the interests of the executive are safeguarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">" 
 

19 To put the advice into context it is necessary to note the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">First, the suggestion that Ms Manning remain with AMP Services until 31 December 2003 was motivated by the fact that if she were still an employee on that day she would be entitled to receive from PwC the balance of her "signing on" payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Second, the comment concerning the restraint on contacting clients deals with the position under the post-employment restraint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Third, the reference to the "Executive Pyramid" is to Ms Manning's group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The advice given was that Ms Manning could discuss the composition of her group provided the discussion was not "personalised", that is, that no names were mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">20 An important question is whether Ms Manning told her group that she had received the offer of employment from GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">One can never be certain of the answer but, on balance, I think she kept the offer to herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The advice she received from her solicitor indicated she should proceed carefully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Ms Harkness said that the offer had not been discussed with her and having regard to her friendship with Ms Manning if anyone had been told it would have been Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In a practical sense also there was no need to discuss the offer with the group for I have no doubt that Ms Manning knew that if she went to GSJBW the others would follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">21 Ms Manning again spoke with Mr Evans in mid-December 2003, probably at his instigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">During their discussion Mr Evans repeated the offer of a position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">A short time later (just before Christmas) Mr Evans handed Ms Manning a draft employment contract for her consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The offer was not accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Ms Manning intended to remain with Arrive until she received the balance of her "signing on" bonus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">But I am sure that Ms Manning had decided that she would in due course accept the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">22 A further written offer (in the form of a letter) was received by Ms Manning on about 13 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is not clear why a further offer was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Nor does the evidence indicate whether this offer differed from the December offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">However that may be, Ms Manning was offered the position of Victorian Manager, Strategic Wealth Management, to commence on 2 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Another copy of the letter has the commencement date altered by hand to 9 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The handwriting was not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">A few days later, on 18 or 19 January, Ms Manning received from PwC the balance of her "signing on" bonus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">She then called Mr Evans and accepted GSJBW's offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">She signed a copy of the offer letter on the morning of 20 January and immediately returned it to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">23 Things then moved very quickly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">At around noon on 20 January Ms Manning telephoned Michael Furness, the acting Managing Director of the Arrive business during Mr Farrington's absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Ms Manning told Mr Furness that she intended to resign to take up a position with another wealth management organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">She inquired whether she could inform the Arrive staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Mr Furness said she could tell the Melbourne staff but that he would inform the national team.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">There is a difference between Ms Manning and Mr Furness on one aspect of their conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Ms Manning says that she identified her new employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Mr Furness says she did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">There is no utility in resolving this dispute for nothing turns on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">24 In any event, the identity of her new employer was not kept secret.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Ms Manning told the Melbourne staff that she was leaving to go to GSJBW at an afternoon meeting which she convened for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I am satisfied this was the first the group knew of her imminent departure for otherwise the meeting was a charade and I do not believe Ms Manning would have gone to such lengths simply to hide the fact that her group had prior knowledge of her move to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">25 There was a second telephone conversation with Mr Furness at around 3.00pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Mr Furness, who was in the Sydney office, called to tell Ms Manning that he and Iain Reid (the National Dealership Development Manager of Arrive) intended to fly to Melbourne to meet Ms Manning that evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">She agreed to await their arrival.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Ms Manning says (but Mr Furness cannot recall) that during this call Mr Furness told her that David Baber, Arrive's Human Resource Manager, would also fly down for the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In the event, Mr Baber did not arrive until the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">26 Before travelling to Melbourne Mr Furness telephoned John McColl, who was a Zone Manager at the Melbourne office, and asked him to keep his eye on Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">He wanted to make sure that Ms Manning did not remove anything from the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Mr McColl did as instructed until Mr Furness and Mr Reid arrived at around 6.00pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Before their arrival Ms Manning took the opportunity to telephone many of her clients (she made around 19 calls) to tell them she was leaving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The precise content of these and other calls to clients is at the heart of this dispute and I will deal with those calls after I have got some other matters out of the way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">27 The first matter is what occurred at the evening meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Ms Manning claims that it was agreed that her employment contract be terminated with immediate effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">If true, this is a matter of some importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The plaintiffs allege that in breach of her contract and her statutory and fiduciary duties Ms Manning improperly poached Arrive's clients while still an employee of AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">These allegations would not have much force if Ms Manning had ceased to be an employee on the evening of 20 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">28 I propose first to set out Ms Manning's account of the meeting, skipping over irrelevant aspects of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The meeting took place on the fourth floor of the PwC building in a room that everyone referred to as the "quiet room".</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It is described that way because the room is off an open-plan office area and is used if a person wishes to have privacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Most of the discussion was between Ms Manning and Mr Furness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Mr Reid took a backseat role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In her affidavit Ms Manning gave a brief account of what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">She said the meeting lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">She had with her a letter of resignation which she handed to Mr Furness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The affidavit then continues: "Mr Furness said that they were happy to give me four weeks notice but that I would not be required at work during this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">I said that I was not happy with that proposal, noting that I could work out the four weeks notice but would go crazy if I had to sit at home doing nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Mr Furness said that in that case it would be immediate with no four weeks pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">I queried this but ended up saying that it was not worth arguing over a few thousand dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">" 
 
29 Ms Manning gave a more detailed account in oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">She said that when she handed over her letter of resignation she commented that it had been hard to make the decision to leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Mr Furness expressed disappointment that she was leaving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">This was followed by a discussion about Ms Manning's future role with GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Mr Furness then referred to Ms Manning's obligation to give four weeks' notice and said: "We won't need you to come in to work for that [period] ... we won't need you in the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">We might need to make a phone call to you here or there, and you might have to come in for client hand-over but probably not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">" Ms Manning protested the suggestion that she go on what she referred to as "gardening leave".</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Following a debate about the lawfulness of this requirement Mr Furness said "well the only other option is to go now but if you do, you don't get the four weeks notice period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">" Ms Manning replied: "I don't think you can do that, that is not right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">... surely I deserve to be paid my notice period".</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Mr Furness responded: "We are not going to pay it, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">" Ms Manning then said "well, fine then, I am not going to argue with you over a few thousand dollars ... but I'm not staying at home on gardening leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">" She said that Mr Furness made "no response to that that I can recall, [no] verbal response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">" 
 
30 Following this discussion Ms Manning was requested to hand over her security pass, company credit card and mobile telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">She pointed out that she had already given the security pass to Mr Furness so that he could go to the bathroom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">She did hand over the credit card but was told to keep the mobile telephone so that she could be contacted and told of the time of the meeting with Mr Baber the following morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">In passing I note that Ms Manning did not at the time mention that she had acquired a new mobile telephone three days earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The parties then moved to Ms Manning's desk which was located in the open office area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">She packed her personal belongings and identified what she was leaving behind -- client contact lists, folders of technical information and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Ms Manning was then "escorted" from the building by Mr Furness and Mr Reid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">31 The critical aspect of the conversation as outlined by Ms Manning is the discussion about the option that she leave immediately and forego four weeks' pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">She contends this amounted to an agreement to terminate her employment contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Mr Furness denies such agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In his evidence in chief he gave the following account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">He confirmed that he told Ms Manning that she should not come into the office during the notice period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">He recalled Ms Manning saying that she had been advised that placing her on "gardening leave" was legally unenforceable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Mr Furness' response was that the issue would be discussed with Mr Baber the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">He conceded that he "did state that there may have been an option to waive the notice period, and as a result of that there may be the need to forego four weeks' pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Angela said that she wasn't really worried about a few thousand dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">" During his cross-examination Mr Furness went into more detail: 
 
 
 "Q: [Y]ou were really stating what the position was so far as the employer --- your company was concerned?</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">
 
 
 A: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">
 
 
 
 Q: At this stage in the narrative did Ms Manning say to you that she wasn't willing to sit out at home for four weeks and do nothing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">
 
 
 A: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">
 
 
 
 Q: And you then said to her, didn't you, that, 'The only other choice was to go now, but if you go now you will not be paid your four weeks notice.'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">
 
 
 A: Words to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">
 
 
 
 Q: Words to that effect?</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">And did she then say to you she didn't think that was right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">She didn't think you could do that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">
 
 
 A: I don't remember.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">
 
 Q: Well, I put it to you that that's what she said to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">
 A: I don't recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">
 
 Q: It's possible that she said that in response to that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">
 A: Possible, but I don't remember it specifically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 
 
 Q: And she then says she said to you, 'Surely, I deserve to be paid the four weeks notice.'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">
 
 
 A: I don't recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">
 
 Q: And you said, no, she didn't?</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">
 A: I don't recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">
 ... 
 
 
 
 Q: So your position is that she immediately said to you, in relation to the waiving and foregoing of four weeks pay, 'I'm not worried about that, it's only a few thousand dollars.'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 
 A: My recollection, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">" 
 

32 Mr Reid also gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Unfortunately his recollection of the conversation is very vague.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In his evidence in chief Mr Reid attributed to Mr Furness the following response to Ms Manning's complaint about being put on "gardening leave": "Nothing is going to be agreed tonight, we will have to wait for Mr Baber to come down the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">" In cross-examination Mr Reid described the discussion that followed Ms Manning handing over her letter of resignation: 
 
 "Q: Now, what were the options that were discussed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">
 
 
 A: Well, the first --- the first option was essentially gardening leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">So, we --- 'You will remain employed throughout your period of notice, but you wouldn't necessarily be required in the office'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">
 
 
 
 Q: All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">And what other options?</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">
 
 
 A: Well, other --- another option was later discussed, but after some discussion around the first option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">
 
 
 
 
 
 Q: All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Well, the discussion around the first option was to the effect that Ms Manning wasn't happy about that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Is that correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">
 
 
 A: That's true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">
 
 
 
 Q: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">And the second option or any other options that were then discussed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">
 A: Well, Mr Furness said --- I think Mr Furness was --- was a little perplexed by the question, but said that --- well, I presumed it would be immediate termination without payment in lieu of notice, or words to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">
 
 
 
 Q: All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">And what was Ms Manning's response, if any, to that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">
 A: I can't recall the specific response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">I can't recall a response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">
 
 
 
 Q: Are you saying that she said nothing to that, or simply that you cannot recall whether she responded?</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">
 A: Well, I think it was --- it was mainly in relation to the --- sorry --- the --- the payment in lieu of notice, and she did make a response in relation to that, and she basically said that --- or rather flippantly, 'Why would I bother about a few thousand dollars'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">
 
 
 
 
 
 Q: All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Now, I take it that relates to whether or not she's going to receive pay in lieu of notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Is that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">
 
 
 A: It does, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">
 
 
 
 Q: That was in the context of Mr Furness saying, 'Well, one of the other options, or the other option is, immediate termination with no pay in lieu of notice'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">
 
 
 A: That's right, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">
 ... 
 
 
 
 Q: All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Didn't Ms Manning say --- I withdraw that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Didn't she say words to the effect of, 'I don't think you can do that, that's not right'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">
 
 
 
 HIS HONOUR: In relation to what?</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">
 
 
 
 In relation to not paying, not giving her pay in lieu of notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Didn't she say words to the effect of, 'You can't do that,' or 'That's not right'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">
 A: I can't recall those words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">The words I remember her mentioning was a flippant comment about 'Why would I bother about a few thousand dollars?</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">' They're the only words I can remember.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">" 
 
 
 

33 The final piece of evidence is a note of Mr Furness' account of the meeting taken by Mr Baber on 21 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I will set out the note in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It is a business record of Arrive and, if it matters, all the parties to the conversation were called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">The note relevantly reads: 
 
 
 "6.10pm 
 Level 4

34 Ms Manning contends that an agreement was reached that in consideration for the release by her of her right to receive four weeks' pay, Mr Furness agreed that Arrive would release her from her obligation to serve out a four week notice period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The question is whether the parties gave their assent to this asserted exchange of promises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">On balance, and I must say that I have wavered on the point, I do not think they did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Ms Manning's case hinges on my acceptance of the proposition that she had agreed to give up four weeks' pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">This is to be inferred from her statement that she was not worried about a few thousand dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">It may be accepted that in the situation in which she found herself Ms Manning was not "worried" about such a relatively small amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">But I do not accept that Ms Manning said that she was prepared to forego that payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Nor is it clear that Mr Furness agreed to release Ms Manning from her contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">First, I do not believe that Mr Furness understood Ms Manning to be making an offer to give up her pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr Baber's note records that "Angela said she reserved the right to the payment in lieu" and that Mr Furness responded: "We'll not debate it here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">" This has the ring of probability about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Second, Mr Furness' statement that Ms Manning's position would be resolved at the meeting with Mr Baber (a statement which I accept he made) puts an end to the argument that the parties had reached any final agreement on Ms Manning's position that evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">35 This conclusion receives strong confirmation from the letter dated 21 January which Ms Manning delivered to Mr Furness immediately following her meeting the next morning with Mr Baber, Mr Furness and Mr Reid, as well as an e-mail from her solicitor dated 23 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Each deals with the purported termination of Ms Manning's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">But the manner in which the employment contract is said to have been terminated is different from the manner now alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">In her letter Ms Manning wrote: 
 
 "I remind you that on my delivering my 4 weeks' written notice of resignation on 20 January 2004 I was immediately required to surrender my access card and corporate credit card and instructed not to attend for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">
 
 The summary termination of my employment in the circumstances referred is a repudiation of the obligations of the Company under my contract of employment which I accept, reserving my entitlement to be paid for the period of 4 weeks written notice referred to in my letter of resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">" 
 

In the e-mail Ms Manning's solicitor wrote: 
 
 "In circumstances where an employee's access and credit cards are impounded, her phone is required to be surrendered, she is instructed not to attend at her ordinary place of work and is watched while she removes personal effects from her office we think it is clear her employment is being terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">" 
 

This shows that Ms Manning was not then acting on the basis that her employment contract had been terminated by agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">I accept that there is a limit to what one can make of a party's conclusion about the legal effect of a conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">When a court is required to determine whether parties have assented to an agreement it is necessary for the court to look to the external or objective appearance of the parties' intention as manifested by their actions and not to their subjective intentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The objective theory applies equally to an agreement to discharge an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">So the fact that neither Ms Manning nor her solicitor was of opinion that there was such agreement is, on one view, irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">On the other hand it does suggest that non-contractual language passed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">36 Returning to the narrative, the next relevant event is the meeting with Mr Furness, Mr Reid and Mr Baber.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The meeting began around 10.00am on 21 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Mr Furness handed Ms Manning a letter which drew to her attention her "continuing contractual obligations" including the confidentiality clause (cl 9) and the post-employment restraint clause (cl 11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The letter went on to say: "During the remainder of your notice period there will generally be no need for you to attend the office (except perhaps to assist with the handover of your clients to other Arrive planners --- in which case I [Mr Furness] will let you know).</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">I should remind you that you remain an employee during this period and must not act against Arrive's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">" Nothing else of any consequence occurred at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">37 In the days following the meeting Ms Manning continued to telephone her clients, especially those with whom she had a close relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">For the most part this was a relationship that had been established while Ms Manning was at PwC as most of her clients had followed her to Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">In all she called approximately 80 clients to tell them she was leaving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Around 75% of those clients moved with her to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">38 It is now convenient to mention what happened to Ms Manning's group, in particular Ms Harkness, Mr Hufton, Mr McGrath and Mr McCarthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Within a day or so of Ms Manning giving notice, each of them had applied for, and a short time later was offered, a position with GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Ms Harkness sought a position in an e-mail she sent to Mr Moir at 10.42pm on 20 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Mr Moir responded at 7.16am the next morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">He informed Ms Harkness that she would be interviewed on 22 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">By 10.42am on 21 January the others had contacted Mr Moir also seeking employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Five days later each had been interviewed and was offered a position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">39 It is alleged that Ms Manning improperly persuaded the group to leave Arrive and join GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Ms Manning says she was not involved in their decision to move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Indeed, in her affidavit Ms Manning said that it was only after the members of the group had resigned that she was told that each had decided to leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">I simply do not accept this story.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">For one thing, during her cross-examination Ms Manning conceded that each member of the group had told her they had applied for employment with GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">For another thing, Ms Manning's telephone records indicate that between 21 January and 27 January she spoke on several occasions with each of Ms Harkness, Mr Hufton and Mr McCarthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Then there is the fact that around 27 January Ms Manning discussed with Mr Moir the bonus commissions that should be paid to "people that may join" GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Ms Manning said that in this discussion no names were mentioned because she had been instructed (presumably by her solicitor) that she should not "talk specifics".</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Nonetheless, from what Ms Manning told Mr Moir he was able to determine the commission to be offered to each member of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Finally there is the fact that each member of the group sent his or her application for employment to Mr Moir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">This is no coincidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">I have no doubt that Ms Manning suggested that the applications should be directed to Mr Moir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">If she did not tell them all she informed at least one who then told the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">40 It may be convenient at this point to summarise my findings in relation to Ms Manning's involvement in the group leaving Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">First, Ms Manning kept to herself that she was contemplating taking a position with GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Second, she told the group of her move on 20 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Third, following that announcement it is likely that Ms Manning spoke to some of the group about them applying for a position at GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">For example, I am sure that she spoke to Mr Hufton before he applied for a position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">On the other hand, I suspect she did not discuss the matter with Ms Harkness, at least not before the latter sent her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Fourth, Ms Manning did not encourage the group to move to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The members needed no such encouragement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">They had been with Ms Manning since their time at PwC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">They formed a successful working unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">They knew that GSJBW was expanding its advisory division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">They no doubt knew without being told that Ms Manning would support their move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Fifth, there was no prearrangement between Ms Manning and GSJBW that if any member of her group applied for a position one would be offered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">To the contrary, the evidence obtained under subpoena from GSJBW suggests that each application for employment were considered on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Finally, although Ms Manning did not induce her group's move, she facilitated the move at least by suggesting an appropriate guarantee bonus to be offered and she may also have been involved in finalising other terms and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">41 The next issue to be resolved is precisely when Ms Manning's employment with AMP Services came to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Her employment contract required four weeks' notice so unless terminated earlier the contract would have terminated by effluxion of time on 17 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">In fact it was terminated earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">42 In Ms Manning's letter of 21 January 2004 she asserted that her employment had been summarily terminated on 20 or 21 January on the basis that AMP Services had repudiated the employment contract which entitled her to bring the contract to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The conduct said to be repudiatory was the instruction not to attend work together with the confiscation of her corporate credit card and security access card.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">43 Ms Manning accepts (correctly in my opinion) that upon giving notice she could be instructed to stay away from work during the notice period if there was an express term to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">On the other hand she says (also correctly in my opinion) that if there was no such term then AMP Services was obliged to provide work for Ms Manning because part of her remuneration was based on performance: see eg William Hill Organisation Ltd v Tucker [1999] ICR 291.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">44 In this case the employment contract permitted the employer, AMP Services, to require Ms Manning not to attend work for some or all of the notice period while continuing to pay her wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">I have already set out cl 7 of the employment contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">It is convenient to repeat para 3 of that clause which provides: "AMP may elect to pay you salary in lieu of notice or require you to work during part or all of your notice period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">" What Ms Manning was told at the meeting on 20 January amounted to the exercise of the option conferred by that clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The instruction was repeated at the meeting on 21 January, as well as in AMP Service's letters of 23 and 27 January to Ms Manning's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The instruction was not a repudiation of the employment contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">It was the exercise of a right conferred by the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">45 During the course of argument Ms Manning attempted to rely on two other incidents as a repudiation of the contract which justified her purported termination of it on 21 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The first is steps taken around 23 January to revoke Ms Manning's status under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as an Authorised Representative of Arrive and the second is the instruction on 4 February to terminate Ms Manning's fortnightly salary payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">This conduct is not repudiatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Even if it were, it would not assist Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">It is a well established rule of contract law that if a party gives an incorrect reason for terminating a contract this does not prevent him from later asserting a good reason, whether or not he was aware of the reason when he brought the contract to an end: Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359, 377-378.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The rule is so well established it needs no elaboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">But the rule only applies if the unstated (and sometimes unknown) ground was available at the time the contract was brought to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">If the repudiatory conduct occurs later it cannot be relied upon retrospectively but only as a trigger for a later acceptance, and there was none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Further, by the time the second of the events had occurred Ms Manning had begun to work for GSJBW although still an employee of AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">For example, she attended GSJBW's office on most working days, she sat in on at least one interview with a client (and probably gave advice to the client during the course of the interview), she helped draft letters to clients of Arrive to assist them to transfer their business to GSJBW and she presented a paper at an in-house conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">This put her in breach of her employment contract (a breach not pleaded) and disentitled her from terminating the contract for repudiation: Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">46 Ultimately the employment contract was terminated on 16 February.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">On that day Arrive wrote to Ms Manning stating that in view of certain (unstated) matters that had come to light "it appears that you have committed acts which justify AMP now summarily terminating your employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Accordingly your employment is terminated as of 16 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">" It is common ground that if not discharged earlier the contract came to an end on 16 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">47 I will now deal with the most important part of the case, the conversations between Ms Manning and her clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I should first point out that the only evidence of these conversations is that given by Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">This was the result of tactical manoeuvring on both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Either the plaintiffs or Ms Manning could have called the clients (or some of them) but decided not to do so, perhaps in the expectation that the other side would call them or perhaps in the hope they would not be called at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">This was in circumstances where the parties knew what the clients, if called, would say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The plaintiffs' senior legal counsel (Katriina Tahka) and Victorian State Manager (Manny Fiteni) had conducted telephone interviews with many of the clients to find out what Ms Manning had said to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Notes of these interviews were produced on discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The defendants sought to tender the notes but, following a voir dire, I ruled them not to be admissible as business records by reason of s 69(3)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">The result was that the plaintiffs had in their possession documents (the interview notes) which are likely critical to the resolution of the issue at hand but would not permit their tender or call the clients, while the defendants knew what the clients would say but would not bring them to court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">48 If it were possible, I would have called the clients myself in order to get to the truth of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">After all, the principal object of a court proceeding is to find the truth and arrive at the right result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Or at least that should be the object.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Unfortunately, while the adversary system is touted as "the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth" (5 Wigmore on Evidence (3 rd ed, 1940) SS1367) it often falls well short of the mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The problem is that the system leaves it to the parties to shape the issues to be litigated and to call the evidence they feel will resolve those issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">And in a civil case it is not permissible for the judge to go behind the parties to call witnesses: Enoch and Zaretzkey, Bock &amp; Co's Arbitration [1910] 1 KB 327.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Perhaps this will one day be reformed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">But until that occurs all a judge is able to do when faced with a refusal by a party to call relevant evidence is, if appropriate, to apply the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">49 The conditions for the application of that rule are explained in Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191, 201-202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Opinions have differed as regards whether these conditions can be satisfied when a witness is equally available to both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Some judges have said that in such circumstances no inference is available: see eg Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">This is not a universally accepted view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">For example, in Earle v Castlemaine District Community Hospital [1974] VR 722, 728, a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Little J, cites with approval the following passage from 2 Wigmore on Evidence (3 rd ed, 1940) SS288, 169- 171 : "The more logical view is that the failure [by both parties] to adduce is open to an inference against both parties, the particular strength of the inference against either depending on the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">To prohibit the inference entirely is to reduce to an arbitrary rule of uniformity that which really depends on the varying significance of facts which cannot be so measured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">" The judge went on to say that it would be erroneous to lay down any "general rule" that if a witness was available to both parties no inference could be drawn against either and that it must depend on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">This, I think, is the correct view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">50 Turning now to the conversations, the evidence should be considered against the following background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Ms Manning said that there was a specific reason she called each client -- an outstanding item of business, the need to make an appointment to discuss a particular issue, the return of a telephone call and so forth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">It may be true that there was a reason to ring each client, but that is not why Ms Manning called them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">She called them to let them know she was leaving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">She had taken advice from her solicitor about what she could safely say to clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Based on that advice she prepared a note of the topics she would discuss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">She had the note with her when the calls were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The note was not produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">51 Ms Manning's account of the conversations is reasonably short and I propose to use her words rather than attempt a summary: 
 
 "Q: What did you say to the clients on the topic of your resignation?</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">
 
 
 A: I said to the clients, it would depend on where it has come into the conversation, but I said to the clients that I wanted to let you know personally that I have resigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">In most instances there was a discussion, a little bit of shock, and in many --- most of the cases what are you doing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">A number of the clients that I had spoken to that afternoon are fairly astute business people, they knew of Weres, so there was a bit of --- in a lot of the cases there was a discussion about --- they knew the Chairman or whatever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 Q: Sorry, can I just interrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">You said, they asked you what are you doing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">What did you reply to that, you told them you were going to Goldman Sachs JB Were?</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">
 
 
 A: I told them --- I did, I told them what I was doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">
 ... 
 Q: I see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Yes, what else?</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">
 
 
 A: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Often the discussions come about to a question as can we continue to do business with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I said, look you are a client of AMP Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">I'm under contractual obligation, I can't --- I can't solicit your business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">I need to be very careful in any discussions with you about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">A number of them, as per Mr Garnsworthy in particular, pushed it very hard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">And I think he was one of the first chaps I had a discussion with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">In all instances I --- or with Mr Garnsworthy I said someone will be in touch with you, I'm sure someone will be in touch with you from AMP Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">He said I'm going to do business with you Ange, he said I know --- I know what I want to do, I'm the client I'll decide what I want to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">I said, look Rob I can't really get into that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">I said --- he asked me when I was starting, I said I have no idea, I said I've got a four week notice period, I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">And he --- Rob in particular said look, just let me know when you get settled, I want to do business with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">I said look, I can't solicit your business Rob, someone will be in touch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">And we really left it at that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">
 
 
 
 Q: You gave him your contact number?</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 A: I did give him my contact number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">
 
 Q: Your new mobile telephone number?</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">
 A: Yes, I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">He had my old one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">
 
 Q: And you gave it to all of the clients you rang that day?</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">
 A: Yes, if asked I did, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">
 
 Q: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">And they all asked you, didn't they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">
 A: If anyone asked me I gave it to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">
 
 
 
 Q: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">And you told each of them, did you, that you can't solicit their business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">You are under contractual obligation not to solicit?</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">
 
 
 A: I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">" 
 

I am prepared to act on the basis that what Ms Manning said to Mr Garnsworthy (and I accept her account of what she said) is substantially what she told her other clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">52 I can now deal with the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The claims in contract can be disposed of in short order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The plaintiffs contend that by engaging in certain conduct, especially the conversations with clients, Ms Manning acted in breach of the post-employment restraint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Even if I were to make the assumption, as is required by cl 11, that the purpose of each call was to entice away clients or disrupt their relationship with AMP Services, the claim is hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">I need do no more than briefly state my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">First, by its terms (which notwithstanding the trust remain unaltered) the restraint operates "after the cessation of [Ms Manning's] employment with AMP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">" I have already explained that her employment did not come to an end until 16 February.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">By then the damage had been done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Second, it is a condition of the operation of the clause that Ms Manning work for a competitor of "AMP".</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">It is clear from the opening paragraph of the employment contract that "AMP" is a defined term: it is defined to mean "AMP Services Limited".</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">So far as I know GSJBW is not a competitor of AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">It is of course a competitor of Arrive, but that is a different company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Absent a rectification order it is not possible to read "Arrive" for "AMP".</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Third, the prohibition imposed by cl 11 is against an approach to any client "of AMP" for the purpose of enticing them away "from AMP".</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">The clients that Ms Manning approached were clients of Arrive and not AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Finally, if it were possible to extend the restraint to Arrive it would be void for being in breach of the common law doctrine of restraint of trade, the modern formulation of which is stated by Lord McNaughton in Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd [1894] AC 535, 565 and accepted for Australia in Buckley v Tutty [1971] HCA 71 ; (1971) 125 CLR 353, 376.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">The unreasonableness of the restraint lies in the fact that it is wider than necessary, covering all Arrive clients, many of whom did not have any connection with Ms Manning: G W Ploughman &amp; Son Ltd v Ash [1964] 1 WLR 568.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">If the restraint had been limited to, say, clients of the Melbourne office it may have been lawful: see eg IF Asia Pacific Pty Ltd Galbally [2003] VSC 192 ; Brilliant Lighting (Aust) Pty Ltd v Baillieu [2004] VSC 248.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">53 Then Ms Manning is said to have breached cl 9 by (according to the amended points of claim) "[making] use of confidential information, viz the names, contact details and financial position of Clients, acquired in the course of her employment with Arrive and [AMP Services] to her own benefit and to the benefit of Goldman Sachs" and by continuing to make use of that information subsequent to 16 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">But here again the confidentiality clause only protects "AMP's business and affairs and that of [AMP's] clients".</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">In any case, even if one could read Arrive as the promisee there are other insurmountable hurdles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">For one thing, the names of clients and their contact details have not been shown to be confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">For another thing, there is no evidence that Ms Manning made use of clients' financial information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">She had no need to do that to make the calls and once a client moved to GSJBW the information could be supplied by the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">54 I can also dispose of the statutory claims without much ado.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">The amended points of claim assert that the duties imposed by ss 182 and 183 are owed to AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">This is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">In Walker v Winborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1, 6-7, Mason J (as he then was) pointed out that because each company in a group is a "separate and independent legal entity" the officer of a company owes his duties to that company alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">See also Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Here it is said that Ms Manning made "(1) improper use of her position to (a) gain an advantage for herself or someone else; or (b) cause detriment to [AMP Services]; (2) improper use of confidential information [vis name, contact details or financial position of clients] obtained in the course of her employment to (a) gain an advantage for herself or someone else; or (b) cause detriment to [AMP Services].</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">" There is no evidence to support the first allegation and, if it matters, none of the conduct about which complaint is made (even if proven) is conduct engaged in by Ms Manning in her "position" with AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">As to the second allegation, the evidence shows that the information (whether confidential or not) was not the property of Arrive but AMP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Sections 182 and 183 do not provide a cause of action for the misuse of confidential information which belongs to a related company and causes damage to the related company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">55 The next claim is for breach of fiduciary duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">The particular duties which are said to have been breached are the traditional duties owed by an employee to his employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">These were: (a) to act in all her dealings with clients in the best interests of Arrive; (b) to protect Arrive's business; (c) in the course of her employment, not to favour her own interests or the interests of any other party over the interests of Arrive; (d) not to induce, suggest or otherwise entice any client to take business away from Arrive; (e) to act in the course of all her dealings with other Arrive employees in the best interests of Arrive; and (f) not to induce, suggest or otherwise entice any employee of Arrive to leave his or her employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">It should be observed that the duties came to an end when Ms Manning's employment was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Loyalty cannot be demanded of a former employee: Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">As Ms Manning was not an employee of Arrive, the fiduciary duties could not arise out of her contract of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">She was, however, retained by AMP Services to work for Arrive and so the usual conditions which would give rise to the fiduciary obligations claimed here do subsist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">For example: Ms Manning was appointed as the head of Arrive's Victorian office and thus undertook to act in its interests; she was given powers which would affect the interests of Arrive; there was a relationship of trust and confidence between herself and Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">The absence of a contract of employment does not deny the fiduciary character of the relationship between Arrive and Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">In the end I do not think that this was seriously contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">56 Having accepted the existence of the duties for which the plaintiffs contend the question is whether those duties were breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Much of the conduct which I have found to have been engaged in by Ms Manning was not in breach of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">For example, informing her group that she was going to leave, telling the group who to contact at GSJBW and even settling some of their terms of employment are not inconsistent with any duty owed to Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Further, merely advising a client that she had resigned would not breach any duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Nor would informing a client that she was proposing to leave Arrive and that she was going to join or had joined GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">57 It is true that in some circumstances the use of client contact details to solicit business can amount to a breach of duty if the client contact details are confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">This is not, however, one of those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">At the meeting on 21 January Ms Manning handed over her mobile telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">However she asked that she be permitted to retain the SIM card on which all client details were stored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">She explained that she wanted the SIM card to place into her new mobile telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">The request was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Mr Furness removed the SIM card himself and handed it to Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">It is simply not possible for Arrive now to complain about the use of the information on the SIM card.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Clearly Arrive did not regard client contact details as part of its confidential information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">58 Arrive also alleges that by assisting members of the group to find employment with GSJBW (for example, by putting them into contact with Mr Moir) Ms Manning acted in breach of fiduciary duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">It is true that Ms Manning provided members of her group with assistance in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">I do not, however, accept that this assistance amounts to a breach of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">There is nothing wrong in helping a person find new employment in circumstances where that person has independently made the decision to leave his current employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">59 The claim that Ms Manning breached her duty not to make use of any business opportunity obtained during the course of her employment must also be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">This kind of claim cannot be brought against an employee in Ms Manning's position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">It is reserved for those in "top management" such as directors or senior officers: Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371, 381-382.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">See also Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie Bros (1854) Macq 461, 472.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">60 Turning to the complaint that in breach of duty Ms Manning approached clients to entice them to deal with her once she went to GSJBW, I think this is exactly what she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Ms Manning's telephone calls to her clients were more than mere "courtesy" calls to notify them that she would be no longer handling their affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">As I have already explained, I do not accept her assertion that the calls were made solely to deal with some immediate or outstanding issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">In each conversation Ms Manning all but openly invited her clients to go with her to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Not only that, it was inevitable that the discussions with her clients would take her down that path.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">Ms Manning knew each client well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">She had taken care of his or her financial affairs for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">The clients placed great trust in her as their financial adviser, a trust which seems not to have been misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Ms Manning must also have known that when told she was leaving Arrive the client would ask where she was going.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">That is what the clients did, and she told them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Ms Manning must also have known that the client would ask her for her new contact details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">That is what the clients did, and she told them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">To add fuel to the fire Ms Manning told each client that she was not permitted to solicit their business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The message was clear: Ms Manning wanted to continue to work for the client but was not permitted to ask and it was for the client to make the first move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">This was enticement pure and simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Not only that, the message was understood and for the most part acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">61 Finally, there is the claim for conspiracy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The allegation here is that Ms Manning conspired with other employees of Arrive to divert clients away from Arrive and to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">The claim was speculative when made and in the event not supported by a shred of evidence at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">62 I will now deal with the claims against Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Much the same allegations were made against her as were made against Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">But there is a dearth of evidence to support any of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">I do not intend to set out what little evidence there is against Ms Harkness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">It is simply a waste of time as was bringing the case against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The only remaining issue of real interest is whether Ms Harkness is entitled to costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">63 So much for the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">As regards remedies, the case was "split" between liability and damages with the consent of the parties and a further hearing will be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Nevertheless I informed the parties that at this stage I would deal with the principles that will govern any claim for damages or compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">64 Arrive is entitled to compensation for Ms Manning's breach of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">In equity, the object of compensation is to restore the person who has suffered loss to the position in which they would have been if there had been no breach of the equitable obligation: Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] AC 932; O'Halloran v RT Thomas &amp; Family Pty Ltd (1998) 45 NSWLR 262; Southern Real Estate Pty Ltd v Dellow and Arnold (2003) 87 SASR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">The critical question to determine is in what position would Arrive have been had Ms Manning not breached her equitable obligation -- that is to say, what actual loss was suffered by Arrive due to the breach?</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">65 Arrive argues (or its argument assumes) that, absent the breach of duty by Ms Manning, it would have retained its clients or could at least have taken steps to convince them to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Hence it claims that it is entitled to the full "value" of each lost client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">66 To accept Arrive's argument is to accept the notion that a fiduciary breach effectively "stops the clock" at the time of breach for the purpose of determining what actual loss was suffered by a party and what the party's ultimate "position" would have been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">This line of reasoning was rejected by the House of Lords in Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (a firm) [1996] 1 AC 421.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">There, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said (at 439):
 
 "Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed to achieve exactly what the word compensation suggests: to make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common sense, can be seen to have been caused by the breach.</sentence>

<sentence id="s627">The cases make clear that the court must take advantage of the "full benefit of hindsight" to ensure that "the losses made good are only those which, on a common sense view of causation, were caused by the breach": Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp; Co. (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 129, 163.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">67 Here common sense requires me to take note of the fact that each client lost to GSJBW made an independent decision to follow Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">This was inevitable given the close relationship between Ms Manning and her clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Indeed, had Ms Manning waited out the notice period before speaking with her clients, I am sure that most would have followed her just as they had followed her from PwC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">68 The actual loss that Arrive has suffered is not the broad "total loss of clients" as Arrive would have it but the loss of the "value" of keeping those clients between 20 January and 16 February (being the day Ms Manning's employment terminated) together with, perhaps, the loss of the opportunity to take steps in that period to retain the lost clients: Southern Real Estate Pty Ltd v Dellow and Arnold (2003) 87 SASR 1, 12-15; Charles Lo Presti Pty Ltd v Karabalios [2000] NSWSC 395 , [31], [49], and [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">On this latter aspect, however, given the history and the close relationship between Ms Manning and her clients, I am not at this point persuaded that "but for" her breach of fiduciary duty the clients would have remained with Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">On the contrary, the evidence so far suggests that regardless of Ms Manning's breach of duty the clients would have remained with Arrive only until her move to GSJBW and they would then have followed her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">69 Though the actual quantification of the claim will take place at a later point, it is necessary to say one final word about the method of calculating that loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">When dealing with equitable compensation a court is often faced with the challenge of placing a monetary value on an elusive loss such as a "loss of opportunity", a loss that defies precise measurement: O'Halloran v RT Thomas &amp; Family Pty Ltd (1998) 45 NSWLR 262, 273, adopting Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton &amp; Co. (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 129, 163.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">To this end the court is permitted to use somewhat subjective "tools" in arriving at a valuation; tools such as common sense and general notions of justice and fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">70 In this case when determining how to place a value on the loss of a client from Arrive's client list several things come to mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">I have already noted that I do not believe Arrive would have been able to convince any of the lost clients to stay with Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">The history and relationship Ms Manning had with her clients, as well as the speed with which they "jumped ship" after learning of her departure, indicate that they would have ended up with her at some point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">I also do not believe it possible to dig into the speculative minutiae of whether any one client would have left of his or her own volition during the period up to termination, or whether another client would have taken five, six or seven weeks to move to GSJBW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">These matters are so speculative that to consider them is to render equitable compensation more an arbitrary lottery than a tool of approximate justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">71 The relevant inquiry is to determine what is the "value" of a client to the business over a specific period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">In theory the concept is a particularly challenging one since there is no standing relationship of client-value as a function of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Nevertheless, the "value" of a company's client is ultimately the income that client brings the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">In the instant case the value of each of those clients to Arrive during period between 20 January and 16 February will be the income Arrive would have gained from each client during that period had the client remained with Arrive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">72 I will hear the parties on what orders should be made to deal with the remainder of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">I certify that the preceding seventy-two (72) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
