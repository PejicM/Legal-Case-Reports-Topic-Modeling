<sentence id="s0">
 This dispute is between an Australian company, Bella Products Pty Ltd (BP), and a corporation established in Delaware, in the United States of America, Creative Designs International Ltd (CDI).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The dispute is whether CDI agreed to distribute in North America a range of toys known as the "Get Up 'N Move" (GUNM) range, which BP manufactures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The procedural problem which has arisen is that each party wants the courts of its own jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">To that end, on 17 April 2009, BP brought this action in the Fast Track List of the Federal Court of Australia seeking a declaration that CDI is in breach of the alleged agreement and has engaged in conduct in contravention of s 52 and/or s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), asking for damages and other relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By that time, CDI had already filed a Summons and Complaint in the Supreme Court of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that the dealings between it and BP "did not give rise to any legally enforceable contractual rights" and, in the alternative, if an agreement did exist, "BP's inability and failure [to perform its obligations] excused CDI of any obligation it may otherwise have had to continue to do business with BP" and, in particular, that "CDI is not liable to BP for damages in any amount".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">CDI now moves to stay the Federal Court action on the basis that it is more appropriate that the New York court resolve the parties' dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The background can be sketched briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">BP was established in 2003 by Mary Toniolo and her husband Paul.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The company operates out of an office in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It designs and manufactures several ranges of toy products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In a relatively short period the business has become successful, with products being sold in Australia and other countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In February 2008 Ms Toniolo met Geoffrey Greenberg, the then President of CDI, in New York to discuss a distribution arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">At the time BP was in the process of developing the GUNM range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Ms Toniolo contends that during their discussion they agreed that CDI would be the exclusive distributor of the GUNM range in North America on terms that CDI would pay for the production of a television commercial, make an advance payment of $US200,000 to BP, purchase GUNM at free on board (FOB) prices, pay a royalty on further GUNM products and be granted an option to distribute any further GUNM products developed by BP into other international markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Correspondence passed between BP and CDI about the development and marketing of the GUNM range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Then, on 3 September 2008, Ms Toniolo sent an email to Mr Greenberg which attached a document entitled "Proposal for the Get Up'N Move brand for North America".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The proposal sets out the basis upon which BP would enter into an agreement with CDI to market the new brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Ms Toniolo says she sent the proposal because she "wanted a more formal agreement in writing" with CDI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In October 2008 Mr Greenberg informed Ms Toniolo that, effective from December 2008, Mr Rinzler would take over his position as President.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Shortly thereafter, Ms Toniolo was told that discussions about the GUNM distributorship were to be put on hold until Mr Rinzler "gets back in the office on 10 November".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">A week later Mr Rinzler sent an email to Ms Toniolo advising her of the terms upon which CDI would take on the GUNM distributorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The terms differed from those Ms Toniolo says had previously been agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">BP immediately retained Messrs Middletons to act on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On 15 January Middletons wrote a letter of demand to CDI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The letter asserted the existence of the distributorship agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It alleged that CDI had breached that agreement, causing BP to suffer loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It also alleged that CDI had breached s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act which proscribes unconscionable conduct and s 52 which provides that a corporation shall not in trade or commerce engage in conduct which is deceptive or misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The letter demanded payment of damages of around $US11 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In default of payment the letter threatened legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">CDI requested time within which to provide a response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Further time was allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">But, instead of providing a reply, on 6 February 2009 CDI commenced its New York action, which it served on BP two weeks or so later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It was open to BP to apply to have the New York action dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">But BP did not move to dismiss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Instead, it sought to remove the Complaint to the United States District Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That application was made out of time so the parties agreed (and in due course the Court ordered) that the Complaint be remanded to the Supreme Court of New York and that "defendant [BP] will not move to dismiss the complaint or assert a defence on lack of personal jurisdiction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mr Watson of Messrs Middletons says that the order of remand does not represent a consent by BP to the jurisdiction of the New York court as BP and CDI did not enter into a forum selection agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As I read the order, BP concedes that the New York court has personal jurisdiction over it but does not accept that it is the appropriate court to deal with the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">However that may be, BP filed an answer, affirmative defence and counterclaim on 24 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The counterclaim asserts, as BP asserts in the Federal Court action, that BP and CDI entered into a distributorship agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">BP alleges that CDI breached the agreement, resulting in BP suffering loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Importantly, BP pleads a cause of action based on a contravention of s 51 and s 52 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There is no doubt that the New York Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain a claim which involves the breach of a foreign statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The position in the United States appears to be that a court will recognise and enforce a right of action in tort (including an action on a statute) created by the law of the place where the defendant's conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Thus, according to the US Supreme Court, a foreign statute "gives rise to an obligation, which, if transitory, 'follows the person and may be enforced wherever the person may be found'", unless to do so would violate the public policy of the state in which the action is pursued; Loucks et al v Standard Oil Co of New York 224 NY 99 (1918) at 109, citing Slater v Mexican National Railroad Company [1904] USSC 100 ; 194 US 120 (1904).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">See also Dennick v Railroad Company [1880] USSC 49 ; 103 US 11 (1880) at 15: "A personal liability created by the statute of another State will, as other personal obligations, be enforced according to the course of procedure in the place where the defendant is found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" The court will apply the public policy exception if to enforce the foreign law "would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal"; Loucks et al v Standard Oil Co of New York 224 NY 99 (1918) at 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">See also Schultz v Boy Scouts of America Inc 480 NE 2d 679 (NY 1985) at [6]; Matter of Walker 64 NY 2d 354 (1985); Shannon v Irving Trust Co 275 NY 95 (1937).</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Generally speaking, the fact that the forum state has no statute on the subject, or that the law of the forum differs from that of the foreign jurisdiction, does not establish that to enforce the foreign statute is contrary to the public policy of the forum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This is the approach taken by both state and federal courts in the majority of states, including New York: see Hausman v Buckley [1962] USCA2 338 ; 299 F2d 696 (1962) ; Ackermann v Levine [1986] USCA2 271 ; 788 F2d 830 (1986).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There are two states --- Maryland and Texas --- which have taken exception to the general rule and have declined to follow Dennick .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The courts in Maryland follow Ash v Baltimore 19 A 643 (1890) where the Maryland Court of Appeal held that "the right of action given by statute for the death of an individual is not transitory, like the common-law right of action for personal injuries, but the operation and force of such a statute must be confined to the state enacting it, except where it can be extended by comity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It will only be extended if the forum state has a similar statute in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Similarly, in Texas the courts look to whether there is a similar statute or, conversely, whether the statutes are so dissimilar as to prevent the court from exercising jurisdiction for breach of a foreign statute: see eg St Louis &amp; SFR Co v Sizemore 116 SW 403 (Tex Civ App 1909); De Herrera v Texas Mexican National Railroad Company 154 SW 594 (Tex Civ App 1913).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Each party has tendered evidence from a practicing US attorney dealing with the jurisdiction of the New York Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I regret to have to say I found their evidence only partially instructive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Each attorney refers to the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), s 4511(b), which provides that "Every court may take judicial notice without request of... the laws of foreign countries and their political subdivisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Judicial notice shall be taken... if a party requests it, furnishes the court sufficient information to enable it to comply with the request, and has given each adverse party notice of his intention to request it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" The attorneys appear to treat this provision as bearing upon the court's jurisdiction to deal with an action for the breach of a foreign statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">My own, but admittedly untutored, view is that s 4511(b) concerns the means by which foreign law may be established and says nothing about jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">For this reason I examined for myself the issue raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Returning to the narrative, prior to BP filing its answer, affirmative defence and counterclaim in the New York action, BP had instituted this action in the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">CDI was served on 13 May 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">On 21 May 2009 CDI applied in the New York court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain BP from continuing to prosecute the Federal Court action pending resolution of the New York action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The New York court refused the application on 28 May 2009, indicating that CDI should seek a dismissal or stay of the Federal Court action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">During the course of the hearing on 28 May 2009 BP told the New York court that its counterclaim in the New York action was based on a mistaken belief that the counterclaim was necessary to avoid an assertion of waiver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">BP indicated that it would withdraw its counterclaim and has since taken steps to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On the same day the New York court made consent orders to prepare the action for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Those orders required the parties to take the following steps: Turning to the stay application proper, it is necessary to determine the basis upon which an action may be stayed on forum non conveniens grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Generally speaking, the test for a stay is whether the forum the plaintiff selected is the "clearly inappropriate forum"; Voth v Minaldra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 ; Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">By way of contrast, the test in England requires the court to decide which of two competing courts is the "more appropriate" forum; Spilada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd (2008) 172 FCR 433 , both at trial and on appeal, the Federal Court applied the Voth and Oceanic Sun Liner test in respect of an application for a temporary stay of an action pending in an Australian court when there was a similar action pending in a United States court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Regrettably (all the more so because I was on the appellate bench) that approach was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The correct test is that stated in Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty v The Boots Company [1992] FCA 72 ; (1992) 34 FCR 287 , a decision affirmed by the High Court in Henry v Henry (1986) 185 CLR 571 at 590 and CSR Ltd v Signa Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 at 390---398.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In Sterling Pharmaceuticals (at 290) Lockhart J said there is a substantial difference between a motion for a permanent stay or dismissal of a proceeding for forum non conveniens and a motion for a temporary stay or an adjournment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He said that when the court was moved for a temporary stay or an adjournment the "clearly inappropriate forum" test was not the applicable test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Lockhart J said that in such a case the court's general power to control its own proceedings enabled it to order a temporary stay "where proceedings are pending in another court and it is desirable that those proceedings should proceed to their conclusion first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">" He said to reach that decision the following considerations were relevant (at 291): The following propositions may be drawn from this list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">First, for obvious reasons it is undesirable that two courts should determine the same dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Second, practical considerations based on common sense and fairness should dictate which action should proceed first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Putting the two actions side by side, there are only a few pointers that suggest which should go ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Nothing can be made of the fact the New York action was filed before the Federal Court action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">That happened because BP was tricked into delaying the commencement of its action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Nor has an action proceeded so far in its preparation to suggest that it should be allowed to go first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There is an advantage to be gained in allowing the Federal Court action to go ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It is an action in the Fast Track List and so will be tried within six months of issue with judgment delivered within six weeks of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The timetable in the New York action suggests that the action will not come on for hearing prior to June 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">CDI contends that any advantage of a speedy trial is outweighed by the disadvantage it would suffer if required to litigate in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The disadvantage concerns witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">CDI's chief witness will be Mr Greenberg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He has told CDI's US attorneys that he is not willing to travel to Australia to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">This does not mean his evidence would be unavailable to an Australian judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">There are two available avenues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">First, Mr Greenberg's evidence could be taken on commission in the United States and the transcript tendered at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Alternatively, his evidence could be received via video conferencing facilities pursuant to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">But Mr Greenberg is not the only problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">CDI will call five or six other witnesses, all of whom reside in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">By contrast, BP has only one witness, Ms Toniolo, and she spends a significant amount of time in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In this case, where the evidence the witnesses will give is likely to be very influential, a party will be disadvantaged if its evidence is provided by transcript or video link.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Not only is there this disadvantage, there is also the considerable expense involved in having a large number of witnesses travel to Australia for a trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">These burdens can be avoided if the Federal Court action is temporarily stayed and the trial takes places in New York.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">For the foregoing reasons I will order a temporary stay of the proceedings pending resolution of the New York action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I would make this order conditional upon an undertaking from CDI that it will not object should BP wish to reinstate its counterclaim in the New York action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">BP should pay CDI's costs.</sentence>
