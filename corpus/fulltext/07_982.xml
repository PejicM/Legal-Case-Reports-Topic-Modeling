<sentence id="s0">
 
1 There are forty-four individual speech sounds in the English language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The individual speech sounds are referred to as "phonemes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">A phoneme may be represented by a letter, or one or more combinations of letters of the alphabet, which are referred to as "graphemes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">For example, the words "moon", "screw" and "glue" contain a common phoneme represented by the combination of the letters "oo", "ew" and "ue".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Ms Denyse Ritchie, a retired teacher and director of the applicant, developed a chart to be used in literacy teaching which depicted words and pictures incorporating the phonemes and graphemes on a chart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The chart is known as the "THRASS Picturechart" and is published in two formats, as a wall chart and "tumble turn" desk chart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">These charts were first published in 1996 and released for sale in both the United Kingdom and Australia that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In 2005, Ms Ritchie became aware of a chart published by the respondent which also depicted words and pictures incorporating phonemes and graphemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The respondent's chart is called the "Sound Waves Sound Chart".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 The applicant is the licensee of the copyright in the THRASS Picturechart and has applied under O 15A of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules) for an order that the respondent make an affidavit giving discovery of such of the following documents as are in its possession, custody or control:
 
 Originals, drafts and copies of all documents comprising, recording or evidencing the research and development of the Sound Waves Chart, from the inception or creation stage through to its present form, as made available by the respondent to members of the public by way of sale or supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">

 Background 
 
4 On 9 March 2006 the applicant's solicitors sent a letter of demand to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The letter described the THRASS Picturechart as the "Works", and went on to say:
 
 Our clients further instruct us that it has come to their attention that you and/or your servants or agents have infringed our client's copyright by reproducing the Works in a chart known as "Sound Waves Sound Charts" in both wall and "tumble turn" desk sizes and selling and distributing the same in Australia without the licence of our client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">By reason of your infringement of our client's copyright in the Works, our client has suffered loss and damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">

5 The letter also demanded that the respondent take a number of steps including giving an undertaking not to infringe the copyright in the Works, delivering up the charts and agreeing to pay damages, failing which their client would "have no option but to commence legal proceedings against you including proceedings for an injunction to be issued to prevent your continued breach of our client's copyright in the Works".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The respondent replied by its solicitors' letter of 24 March 2006 disputing that there had been a breach of copyright and pointing out a number of differences between the "THRASS Charts" and the "Sound Waves Sound Charts".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The solicitors also said that the THRASS Charts and the Sound Waves Sound Charts were both premised on the "phonemic teaching approach" which was a concept unoriginal to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The letter went on to say that:
 
 There has also been a significant amount of labour, time and effort expended in creating the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There is copyright in the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Sound Waves Charts were developed as a result of the work of the authors, as primary school teachers, in their own classrooms dating back as far as 1995, when they began using a phonemic approach to assist children to learn to spell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is a fundamental difference between the THRASS Charts and the Sound Waves Charts in the implementation of the Phonemic Approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">After much deliberation and a number of revisions the authors developed icons (small, easily recognisable pictures) to represent the phonemes of the English Language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">

7 By letter of 12 July 2006 the applicant's solicitors responded to the respondent's solicitors' letter of 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">They said that the statements in their letter referred to in [6] above, amounted to:
 
 an evidentiary obstacle to our client's capacity to take appropriate legal advice, and thereby enable or otherwise assist it to make a decision as to whether to commence a proceeding against your client in relation to our client's concern that copyright in its THRASS Charts has been infringed by your client's Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">

8 The applicant's solicitors' letter went on to request that the respondent provide discovery of all documents in the respondent's possession, custody or control relating to the research and development of the Sound Waves Charts from the inception or creation stage through to its present form, failing which they would apply for pre-action discovery pursuant to O 15A r 6 of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 By letter of 18 August 2006, the respondent's solicitors set out details of the development of the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The solicitors' letter included the following statement:
 
 In 1995, one of the authors, Barbara Murray, began using a phonemic approach to children's literacy, in her classroom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Ms Murray re-organised the school's spelling lists and grouped them according to the sound or phoneme, rather than alphabetically, to assist her students who were struggling to read and write.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Rudimentary forms of the Sound Charts were developed in table form for consonants and vowels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">These were the precursors to the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Ms Murray developed this approach independently of any source, and without being aware of any formal studies surrounding the phonemic approach to literacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

10 The letter went on to say that the Sound Waves program was formulated based on the previous classroom experience of the authors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It was said that in 2000 "Sound Boxes" were developed independently representing 43 sounds by icons, icon names and samples of the more common graphemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">These Sound Boxes were then grouped together to form the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 The letter also said that the process of determining the style and layout of the Sound Waves Charts was "iterative" with changes in layouts and colours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 The applicant was not satisfied with the response from the solicitors for the respondent and commenced this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">13 Order 15A r 6 of the Rules provides:
 
 Where ---
 
 
 (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; 
 
 
 
 (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and
 
 (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision ---
 
 
 the Court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

14 The respondent did not contend at the hearing that the applicant had failed to comply with the provisions of O 15A r 6(a) and 6(c) of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The ground on which the respondent opposed the application was that the applicant had not complied with O 15A r 6(b) of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It was contended that the applicant had not shown that it did not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain the relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Does the applicant have sufficient information?</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
15 At the hearing the applicant relied upon a number of affidavits from Ms Ritchie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">These affidavits exhibited the correspondence between the solicitors referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Ms Ritchie also deposed that THRASS Charts had been distributed and sold to schools in Queensland since 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Further, Ms Ritchie said that Queensland was historically the biggest state market for THRASS educational material in Australia and that the authors of the Sound Waves Charts, Ms Barbara Murray and Ms Teresa Watson, were both teachers at Cooroy State School in Queensland in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Ms Ritchie also exhibited documents to her affidavit which showed that THRASS material had been sold to the Cooroy State School in 1999 and that in May 1999 Ms Watson attended a two day course at the Cooroy State School on THRASS methodology and THRASS Charts and how to use them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 The respondent relied upon four affidavits in opposition to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">These affidavits were sworn by Ms Barbara Murray, a retired teacher, Ms Teresa Watson, a teacher, and Ms Ann Smales, a director of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">17 Ms Murray deposed that in 1995 she was teaching students aged 9 years to 11 years at Cooroy State School and that she was very committed to teaching phonemic skills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">She said that in that year she reorganised the school's spelling list according to sound, and in 1996 began making rudimentary charts showing the various combinations of letters for each sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The charts were very simple and were hung on classroom walls and students began using them as a reference for spelling and reading unfamiliar words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In 1996, she said that, the charts were expanded with word examples of graphemes, including graphemes in bold print to jog the students' memories as to how each grapheme worked to represent the particular sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Ms Murray also began creating class team games and a small group of card games along with worksheets for each sound to accompany the classroom wall charts that she had already developed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">18 Ms Murray said that she discussed with Ms Watson, a colleague who was also implementing a phonemic approach to literary skills in her classroom, the lack of written resources available for the teaching of the phonemic approach and the need for such resources to be available for use in the classroom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">19 Ms Murray said that in late 1999 she met Ms Ann Smales at a social function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In the course of her conversation with Ms Smales, Ms Murray described the phonemic approach and what she had been doing in the classroom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Ms Smales then invited Ms Murray and Ms Watson to meet with her and a co-director of the respondent, Mr Peter Stannard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">This led to the respondent asking Ms Murray and Ms Watson to produce materials for publication by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In 2000, Ms Watson and Ms Murray started to write the first drafts of the Sound Waves student activity books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 Ms Murray went on to depose that the Sound Waves Charts evolved from the first resources used in her classroom in 1995 and the Sound Waves student activity books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">21 Ms Murray said that the development and layout of the Sound Waves Charts was the result of an expansion of the horizontal banners which had been used in the early worksheets and the more developed worksheet banners in the Sound Waves activity-sheet books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">She concluded by saying:
 
 All of the key elements found in the current Sound Waves Sound Charts are derived directly from the earliest charts that I developed and used in my classroom from 1995 until my retirement in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

22 Ms Murray annexed a number of documents to her affidavit, including copies of the spelling lists which she had amended, and deposed that to the best of her knowledge, she did not any longer have in her possession or control, any documents falling within the category in respect of which discovery was sought, other than the documents annexed to the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">She said that all of the documents falling into the category of documents requested by the applicant were either thrown out or destroyed some years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">23 Ms Teresa Watson said that she had begun working as a part-time teacher at the Cooroy State School in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Ms Watson taught the phonic component of the curriculum of the year 2 and year 3 class that she taught.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">She discussed with Ms Murray, in 1999, the idea of developing a resource to assist in extending the phonemic approach to the spelling area of the curriculum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Ms Watson said that in 2000, she and Ms Murray met with Ms Smales and another director of the respondent and agreed to create a series of student workbooks to be used in teaching a phonemic approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">24 Ms Watson went on to say that, while conducting workshops promoting the Sound Waves resources, she received requests from teachers for a wall chart to complement the student activity books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">She said that it was as a result of those requests that she and Ms Murray decided to develop charts which were suitable for a wall chart and could also be reproduced in the student activity books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">25 Ms Watson also said that she was involved in the design of the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">She said that she initially designed two draft layouts for Sound Waves Charts which are exhibited to her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">She went on to depose that in conjunction with a designer and artist they subsequently developed a number of different drafts of the Sound Waves Charts which were deemed unsuitable for teaching purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">She exhibited to her affidavit the charts which she said she retained in her possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Ms Watson deposed that the shortcomings in the draft charts were met by the artist choosing a landscape orientation for the page and then enlarging the size of the grapheme word and graphics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A prototype of that chart was then developed and refined with various style changes, and many test colours were trialled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">26 Ms Watson deposed that she did not copy the THRASS Picturechart or any part of it in developing the Sound Waves resources nor the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The development, she said, was the direct result of collaboration with Ms Barbara Murray in further developing the phonemic method she began in her classroom in 1995, and her collaboration with Ms Smales in developing a suitable layout and design for the Sound Waves wall charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">27 Ms Watson also said that, other than the documents which were annexed to her affidavit, she did not have in her possession or control, any other documents falling within the category of documents in respect of which discovery had been requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">28 Ms Smales swore two affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In the first affidavit, sworn on 9 November 2006, after referring to the category of documents in respect of which the applicant sought discovery, Ms Smales deposed:
 
 I have made reasonable enquiries and to the best of my knowledge, other than copies of documents annexed to the affidavit of Barbara Murray sworn 8 November 2006 and the affidavit of Teresa Watson sworn 7 November 2006, the Respondent no longer has in its possession or control any such documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Any other drafts, prototypes and/or "mock-ups" of the category of documents requested by the Applicant, and held by the Respondent have either been thrown out or destroyed in the course of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">

29 Later, on 30 November 2006, Ms Smales swore a further affidavit saying that since making her first affidavit certain documents had "come to her attention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">One of these documents was an email dated 8 February 2005 from Ms Watson to Ms Smales together with an attachment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The attachment contained a draft consonant sound chart and vowel sound chart which Ms Watson said that she had produced on her computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">30 Another of the documents attached to the affidavit, was a copy of a handwritten page which, Ms Smales said, was one of over 100 pages which comprised two manuscripts - being the precursors to the published version of the corresponding pages in the student activity books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">31 Ms Smales also deposed that the respondent had two electronic files in its possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The first electronic file contained documents relating to the design and cover of the charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Ms Smales said that these documents were substantially in the form of the charts annexed to the affidavit of Ms Watson, save for the fact that they were differently coloured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The second electronic file contained icons created by the designer for the Sound Waves student activity books and used in the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">32 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the applicant already had sufficient information in order to decide whether to commence proceedings against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Ms Murray and Ms Watson had deposed at some length to the development of the Sound Waves Chart, and they said that they had not copied the THRASS Picturechart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Further, said senior counsel, all the deponents had deposed that they were not in possession of any documents falling within the category of documents in respect of which discovery was sought, save for those documents already annexed to their affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Senior counsel went on to submit that there was no further material which the respondent could reasonably expect to obtain before making a decision whether to commence a proceeding against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">He contended that the applicant's decision whether to proceed, depended upon its own assessment of the veracity of the evidence of the authors, and its view of the objective similarity or otherwise between the Sound Waves Chart and the THRASS Picturechart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">33 Counsel for the applicant contended that the denials of the existence of further documentation which was contained in the affidavits relied upon by the respondent, could not be taken at face value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In particular, counsel referred to the fact that notwithstanding that Ms Smales had deposed to the fact that after having made reasonable inquiries, the respondent was not in possession of any documents in the category in respect of which discovery was requested, Ms Smales had sworn a second affidavit in which she accepted that the respondent was in possession of documents which did fall into the relevant category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Further, counsel for the applicant referred to the fact that there was no reference in either of the affidavits of Ms Murray or Ms Watson to the existence of any electronic files that may have been created and stored on their computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">34 Whether a party has sufficient information for the purpose of O 15A r 6(b) of the Rules is to be determined objectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilley Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, Lindgren J, 26 May 1999), Lindgren J observed at 29:
 
 The rule is...directed to aiding an applicant who is having real difficulty, and reasonably so, in deciding whether to litigate because of a lack of key information, whether relating to its own case or to that of the proposed respondent, which is in the possession of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">

35 Lindgren J went on to observe at 30:
 
 Having regard to the extensive scientific research which has been carried out by or on behalf of Alphapharm and its strong prima facie case, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in seeking pre-action discovery, it is seeking to eliminate a possibility, rather than to obtain key information without which it is not able to decide whether to commence a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">

36 In Minister for Health &amp; Aged Care v Harrington Associates Limited [1999] FCA 549 , Sackville J at [46] accepted that the assessment as to whether the applicant had "sufficient information" within the meaning of O 15A r 6(b), could be made by reference to the information which had been provided after the commencement of the application for relief under O 15A of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">37 In my view, there is substance in the applicant's criticism of the respondent's evidence in relation to the existence of further documentation in its possession, custody or control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">38 Firstly, there is no explanation given by Ms Smales for the failure to refer, in her first affidavit, to the existence of the documents which were subsequently disclosed in her second affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">All that Ms Smales said in her second affidavit, was that those documents had "come to her attention" since swearing the first affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">There is no explanation as to the extent of the inquiries which she made, prior to swearing the first affidavit, nor to the extent of the inquiries that she made prior to swearing the second affidavit, nor to the circumstances which led to the documents in question "coming to her attention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">39 Secondly, Ms Smales in her second affidavit, has deposed to the existence of a class of documents, namely, the handwritten draft pages of the student activity books, which fall within the category in respect of which discovery is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">However, only one of those handwritten draft pages is annexed to the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">There is also, of course, a reference in that affidavit to the existence of electronic files in the respondent's control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The documents comprising those files were also not annexed to Ms Smales' affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">40 Thirdly, the second affidavit of Ms Smales refers to, and contains as an annexure, an email written by Ms Watson in 2005 referring to development of the Sound Waves Charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The email contained its own electronic attachment which was a draft of the chart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In the email, Ms Watson says that she had produced the draft chart on her computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">41 Ms Watson does not refer in her affidavit to having created any files on her computer in the course of working on the development of the Sound Waves Charts, nor does she refer to any email communications with Ms Smales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">42 Further, in deposing that, other than the documents annexed to her affidavit, she did not have any other relevant documents in her possession, Ms Watson did not refer to having made any search of the files that may have been on her computer, nor to having deleted the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">43 I am of the view, therefore, that when swearing her affidavit, it is likely that Ms Watson misapprehended the nature of the documents which were relevant, and overlooked any electronic files she may have created and stored on her computer, in relation to the development of the charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The same may be true in respect of Ms Murray but there is no evidence of Ms Murray having used a computer in developing the charts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">44 It follows that I am not satisfied that the respondent has by means of the affidavits relied on, disclosed all of the relevant documents in its custody, possession or control which may assist the applicant in making the requisite decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In light of the uncertainty arising from the matters referred to at [38] to [43] above, the applicant's contention that it does not have sufficient information to make the requisite decision is founded on reasonable grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In the circumstances, I am of the view that the applicant does not have "sufficient information" within the meaning of O 15A r 6(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The applicant has, therefore, satisfied the only contested condition under O 15A r 6, and the respondent should give discovery in respect of the documents falling within the category referred to in [3] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Further orders sought by the applicant 
 
45 I also record that, at the hearing counsel for the applicant submitted that the Court should make further orders in terms of a minute of proposed orders dated 30 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">These orders included orders for discovery by third parties and also orders for oral examination of the directors of the respondent and Ms Murray and Ms Watson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">I decline to make orders in terms of the minute of proposed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">46 Firstly, the proposed orders extend beyond the scope of the relief which was sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The only relief sought in the application was that set out in the schedule to the application and referred to in [3] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">47 Secondly, the evidence does not support the making of those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Counsel for the applicant submitted that the proposed orders were needed to obtain information in order to consider whether to commence a proceeding against the directors of the respondent and/or other persons who may have authorised or aided and abetted the alleged infringement of the applicant's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The applicant's evidence did not support the submission by the applicant's counsel that the applicant was contemplating bringing a proceeding against third parties, and so required further information in order to make the requisite decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The only potential proceeding referred to in the applicant's solicitors' correspondence, which was relied upon as comprising the fulfilment of the obligation under O 15A r 6(b) to make reasonable inquiry, was a proceeding against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">48 
 
I will hear the parties in relation to the terms of the orders and the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis.</sentence>
