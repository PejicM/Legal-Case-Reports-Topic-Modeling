 1 I have before me two notices of motion both filed on 20 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">One is brought by the first, second and third applicants in the substantive case ('the first notice of motion'), the other by the first and second respondents in the substantive case ('the second notice of motion').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For convenience, I shall refer to the first notice of motion in this case as that brought by 'the applicants', and the second notice of motion as that brought by 'the respondents', and I propose to deal with them in that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 On 15 February 2006 I ordered the parties to make discovery by verified List of Documents and file and serve such List of Documents on or before 4.00 pm on 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The applicants filed and served their List of Documents on 13 April 2006 and provided inspection of the documents contained in the applicants' List of Documents to the respondents on 4, 8 and 9 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 11 May the respondents requested the provision of certain documents contained in the applicants' List of Documents and these were provided on 16 May 2006.</sentence>

<sentence id="s8">5 Solicitors for both the applicants and the respondents depose that on 28 June 2006, McCullough Robertson, acting on behalf of the respondents, wrote to Lynch &amp; Co, acting on behalf of the applicants, and noted that they intended to raise with them 'the issue of the inadequacy of the applicants' discovery' (affidavit of Paul Hardman of 20 July 2006 par 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 (Reference to this letter of 28 June 2006 and this specific statement was repeated in par 8 of the affidavit of Mr Paul Lynch filed 27 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">At the hearing of these notices of motion last Friday the respondents objected to certain evidence of the applicants, including par 8 of Mr Lynch's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">This objection is somewhat surprising, given that Mr Hardman deposes to the same facts in his affidavit par 4.</sentence>

<sentence id="s13">The hearing of the substantive case was scheduled to commence on Monday 17 July 2006 for two weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On the application of the applicants I adjourned the hearing of this matter for reasons including that a considerable volume of material was put before the applicants in the days before the trial.</sentence>

 Discovery 
 
 9 Order 15 Federal Court Rules deals with discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The parties in particular have referred me to O 15 rr 2(3), 3, 6 and 8, and Practice Note 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">10 Order 15 r 2(3) provides that: 
 
 Without limiting rule 3 or 7, the documents required to be disclosed are any of the following documents of which the party giving discovery is, after a reasonable search, aware at the time discovery is given: 
 
 (a) documents on which the party relies; and 
 (b) documents that adversely affect the party's own case; and 
 (c) documents that adversely affect another party's case; and 
 (d) documents that support another party's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 11 Matters to be taken into account in for the purposes of making a reasonable search as required by r 2(3) are set out in O 15 r 2(5), namely: 
 
 (a) the nature and complexity of the proceedings; and 
 (b) the number of documents involved; and 
 (c) the ease and cost of retrieving a document; and 
 (d) the significance of any document likely to be found; and 
 (e) any other relevant matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
 12 Order 15 r 3 provides that: 
 
 (1) The Court may, before or after any party has been required under rule 1 to give discovery, order that discovery under rule 2 by any party shall not be required or shall be limited to such documents or classes of documents, or to such of the matters in question in the proceeding, as may be specified in the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 (2) The Court may make such orders under sub-rule (1) as are necessary to prevent unnecessary discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 13 Rule 6 provides that: 
 
 (1) A list of documents required by or under this Order shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be in accordance with Form 22 and conform to the requirements of this rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 (2) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents which are or have been in the possession, custody or power of the party making the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 (3) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents in a convenient sequence and as shortly as possible, but shall describe each document or, in the case of a group of documents of the same nature, shall describe the group sufficiently to enable the document or group to be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 (4) ... 
 (5) ... 
 (6) ... 
 (7) ... 
 (8) ... 
 
 14 Rule 8 provides for orders for particular discovery and is as follows: 
 
 Where at any stage of the proceeding, it appears to the Court from evidence or from the nature or circumstances of the case or from any document filed in the proceeding that there are grounds for a belief that some document or class of document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party, the Court may order that party: 
 
 (a) to file any affidavit stating whether that document or any document of that class is or has been in his possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it; and 
 (b) to serve the affidavit on any other party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 
 15 Notwithstanding my order of 15 February 2006 it appears that a considerable volume of material was disclosed by the respondents to the applicants in the days leading to trial in July this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">16 On the other hand, the respondents claim that a significant amount of material remains to be discovered by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">17 The adjournment of the hearing of this case, because of issues involving relevant documents which both parties claim require disclosure, requires questions of further discovery to be resolved without delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Without doubt, it is in the interests of the litigants that discovery be concluded, to ensure this matter be progressed to trial in November this calendar year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">18 Both the written and oral submissions of counsel in this hearing focused on two composite documents, both of which were prepared by the solicitors for the respondents for the purposes of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">These composite documents contained comments from each party, and were headed: &#8226; Response to page 4 of fax dated 14 July 2006 and further response to fax dated 20 July 2006 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This table of responses refers specifically to some of the documents listed in the schedule attached to the applicants' notice of motion and sought by the applicants, and summarises pre-hearing communications between the legal representatives of the applicants and the respondents as to those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">&#8226; Schedule of applicants' undiscovered documents .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">This schedule contains a list of documents sought by the respondents, and summarises pre-hearing communications betweens the legal representatives of the applicants and the respondents as to those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">19 During the hearing I noted that a considerable volume of material had been filed by the parties by way of affidavit, both in the lead up to and during the hearing itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I asked the parties to consider whether they had any additional submissions to direct my attention to specific aspects of those affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It was clear however, both from the written and oral submissions, and the responses of counsel, that the key documents for both parties are the two composite documents I note above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 The First Notice of Motion 
 
 20 The applicants in the first notice of motion sought the following orders: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The first and second respondents file an affidavit stating whether any of the documents or classes of documents referred to in the schedule to this application is or has been in their possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is not then in their possession, custody or power when they parted with it, such affidavit to be filed and served within 7 days of the date of this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The first and second respondents file and serve a Supplementary List of Documents in Form 22 and otherwise in compliance with O 15 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules within 14 days of the date of this order discovering any document annexed to the affidavits of the respondents' witnesses filed in this action which are not already listed in the first and second respondents' List of Documents filed 29 March 2006 and the documents referred to in the affidavit required to be filed by par 1 of this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The first and second respondents and the solicitors for the first and second respondents file and serve an affidavit within 14 days of the date of this order stating the grounds and reasons why the documents contained in the schedule prepared by the first and second respondents and tendered to the Court on 17 July 2006 --- 
 
 
 (a) were not discovered in the first and second respondents' List of Documents filed 29 March 2006; and/or
 (b) were not discovered by Supplementary List of Documents between 29 March 2006 and the date of the delivery of the first and second respondents' statements to the applicants; and/or
 (c) have not yet been discovered.</sentence>

 Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board containing resolutions or evidencing discussion of the material provided to it by Mr Strahley from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards 
 22 I understand the reference to 'Strahley paragraph' in the first column to be a reference to paragraphs in the affidavit of Mr Andrew Strahley sworn and filed 12 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">23 Prior to the hearing there were communications between the parties as to documents for which the applicants now seek an order for discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">On 14 July 2006 Lynch &amp; Co on behalf of the applicants faxed a letter to McCullough Robertson on behalf of the respondents, inter alia , asking for further discovery of documents which Lynch &amp; Co had identified as relevant from the affidavit of Mr Andrew Strahley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There was further correspondence between the parties, including facsimile transmissions between the parties on 20 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">24 A table of responses was prepared headed 'Response to page 4 of fax dated 14 July 2006 &amp; further response to fax dated 20 July 2006', and handed to me in Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The submissions of the parties, to the extent that they dealt with this notice of motion, referred to this table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">25 I note however that the documents referred to in the Schedule to the notice of motion, and the documents referred to in the table of responses handed to me in Court, are not identical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Schedule to the notice of motion includes additional documents which, to the extent I can ascertain, have not been previously discussed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">They are: &#8226; Agreement for purchase of remaining 20% held by vendors (par 14 Strahley affidavit) &#8226; Reports provided by Davidson and Sims (par 18(g) Strahley affidavit) &#8226; Records detailing rejection by juice producers (par 32 Strahley affidavit) &#8226; Employment contract --- Matthew Burns &#8226; Notice of resignation --- Matthew Burns to Sunstate Orchards &#8226; Copies of material provided by Andrew Strahley to Hancock Board from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards &#8226; Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board containing resolutions or evidencing discussion of the material provided to it by Mr Strahley from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 First order sought 
 
 26 It is useful to address in turn each document in the Schedule attached to the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 Agreement for Purchase of Assets dated 24 January 2001 (par 11 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 27 The respondents have indicated that this document is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Strahley sworn and filed 12 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">However, as submitted by the applicants, inclusion of a document as an annexure to an affidavit is not, in itself, proper discovery of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">While the rules of discovery have been subject to change over time and in different courts, the comments of Lindley LJ in Kennedy v Dodson (1895) 1 Ch 334 at 340 over a century ago continue to apply, namely: 
 
 'It is the right, as a general rule, of a plaintiff in equity to exact from the defendant a discovery upon oath as to all matters of fact which, being well pleaded in the bill, are material to the plaintiff's case about to come on for trial, and which the defendant does not by his form of pleading admit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">' 
 
 28 Even earlier, Lyndhurst LC in Taylor v Rundell (1841) Cr &amp; Ph 104, 41 ER 429 framed discovery in terms of an obligation which parties to litigation must satisfy: 
 
 'If it is in your power to give the discovery, you must give it; if not, you must show that you have done your best to procure the means of giving it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 (ER 433, cf more recently von Doussa J in Re McGorm; ex parte Co-operative Building Society of SA (1989) 86 ALR 275 at 278 and Tamberlin J in KC v Shiley Inc [1997] 796 FCA (14 August 1997).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">) 
 
 29 Order 15 of the Federal Court Rules creates a framework for discovery in this court, failure to comply with which can have serious consequences for parties to an action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In my view it is clear that simply annexing a document to an affidavit is not in itself 'discovery' of that document within O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">30 The applicants have submitted further that this document is relied on by the respondents as part of their evidence-in-chief in this action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">This submission is not disputed by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">31 Accordingly it appears that this document is discoverable within the terms of O 15 r 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 Agreement for purchase of remaining 20% held by vendors (par 14 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 32 No submissions have been made by either the applicants or the respondents in relation to this document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Paragraph 14 of Mr Strahley's affidavit sheds little additional light on the document description, and indeed no document of this description is referred to in that paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">My attention has not been directed elsewhere to any other reference to this document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Further, the relevance of the document is not immediately clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">33 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 Reports provided by Davidson and Sims (par 18(g) Strahley affidavit) 
 
 34 Similar concerns apply in relation to these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Indeed, while Mr Strahley in par 18(g) of his affidavit refers to Messrs Davidson and Sims, there is no reference in this paragraph to any reports they may have prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">My attention has not been directed to any other reference to these documents, and the nature of their contents and the relevance thereof is not immediately clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">35 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 Farm Manager Reports (pars 20 and 22 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 36 The specific documents sought by the applicants are Farm Manager Reports for the years 2003 and 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The years in question were clarified after correspondence between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">37 Although in their table of responses addressed by the parties in Court, the respondents disputed that these documents are relevant, they also submit that the documents have already been discovered by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">At the hearing, Mr McQuade for the respondents drew my attention to the List of Documents filed by the applicants on 13 April 2006, p 8 item 53, which states 'December 2001-February 2005, Hancock Farm Company --- Farm Management Reports'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The respondents therefore submit that discovery by them of these documents is unnecessary, on the basis that the applicants already have them (O 15 r 2(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">38 The applicants however submit that the documents are relevant, and that they should be discovered by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">39 Order 15 r 2(4) provides: 
 
 'However, a document is not required to be disclosed if the party giving discovery reasonably believes that the document is already in the possession, custody or control of the party to whom discovery is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 
 
 40 Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicants, their List of Documents speaks for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It appears that they already have these records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, O 15 r 2(4) applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 Budgets and Budget summaries (pars 20 and 23 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 41 There does not appear to be any dispute as to the relevance of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The respondents claim however that all relevant documents have been discovered in accordance with O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In the table of responses, the respondents invited the applicants to identify any specific budget or budgetary summary they considered should be discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">42 The applicants made specific requests, namely that: &#8226; the respondents identify by reference to discovery number the Budgets referred to in par 20 of Mr Strahley's affidavit which they assert have been discovered &#8226; the respondents identify by reference to discovery number the Budget summaries referred to in par 20 of Mr Strahley's affidavit which they assert have been discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">43 The respondents repeated their previous response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">44 In my view the further response of the respondents is unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">These documents should be discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 Records detailing rejection by juice producers (par 32 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 45 Paragraph 32 of Mr Strahley's affidavit states 'Waste has been negligible or immaterial'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There is no reference in this paragraph to any records as sought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">My attention has not been directed to any other reference to such records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">46 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 SmartPak and TotalPak software data files 1998-2005 (par 40 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 47 These documents are also the subject of a discovery application by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">48 It is common ground that: &#8226; the 'SmartPak' and 'TotalPak' records are data files located on a computer &#8226; the computer is located in the packing shed which is currently on property controlled by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">49 However, each party claims that: &#8226; they do not have the documents in their possession, custody or power; rather &#8226; the other party has the documents in their possession, custody or power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">50 The applicants have submitted that, as the computer is on the property of the respondents, the respondents should return the computer to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In turn, the respondents have submitted that they would, if requested, allow the applicants access to the packing shed to obtain the records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">51 In light of this apparent consensus, it is somewhat surprising that these records continue to require a ruling by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">52 The parties have not sought an order, nor do I propose to make any order giving rise to any inference, that operates as a final adjudication upon any entitlement, by way of right, in either party to the property in question, in terms of proprietary or possessory title to the relevant computer or its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The question arises however as to whether the documents are in the 'possession, custody or power' of either party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">53 The terms 'possession, custody or power' in O 15 represent three alternative states.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">As summarised in one learned text: 
 
 'The term "possession" means the physical or corporeal holding of the document pursuant to a legal right to its possession... (for example, agents and bailees); "custody" means the mere actual physical or corporeal holding of a document, regardless of its right to possession, (for example, servants and employees)...; and "power" means an enforceable right to inspect the document or to obtain possession or control of it from the person who ordinarily has it in fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">' 
 (SD Simpson, DL Bailey and EK, Evans Discovery and Interrogatories 2 nd edn, Butterworths, Australia, 1990 at 43, see also Halsbury's Laws of England 4 th edn vol 12 Discovery par 39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">With respect to 'possession' and 'custody' see also Santow J in Horsley v Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers Pty Ltd (1995) 7 BPR [97557] at 14,371-14,372; Stephen J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1977] HCA 57 ; (1979) 143 CLR 499 at 504-505; and S Fisher Commercial and Personal Property Law, Butterworths, Australia, 1997 ch 3; and with respect to the meaning of 'power' see also Beaumont J in Australian Independent Newspapers Ltd v John Fairfax Holdings Ltd (Federal Court of Australia, 22 June 1994) par 12 and Lord Diplock in Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum (1980) 1 WLR 627 at 635-6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">) 
 
 54 However, on the basis of the current arrangements, it appears that the documents are in the possession and custody of the respondents in that: &#8226; the respondents have possession, that is the physical or corporeal holding of the documents, on the basis that (it appears) they presently have lawful possession of the computer where the SmartPak and TotalPak files are stored &#8226; the respondents have custody of the documents, that is they have the mere actual physical or corporeal holding of the documents, through their physical or corporeal holding of the computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">55 Although from the submissions of the parties it appears that the applicants may have an enforceable legal right to obtain the documents from the respondents, the applicants do not, in the words of Lord Diplock in Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum (1980) 1 WLR 627 at 635-636, have 'power' over the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">They do not have the enforceable legal right to obtain the documents from the respondents without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else .</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The submissions of both parties indicate that the applicants would need to obtain the consent of the respondents to access the computer and therefore obtain the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Even if the respondents are likely to comply voluntarily with a request of the applicants to access their property, and in turn the computer and the documents, it does not mean that the documents are currently 'in the power of' the applicants (cf comments of Lord Diplock in Lonrho at 636H).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">56 As the respondents have offered to allow the applicants access to the computer containing the records, in my view it is appropriate in relation to these documents that, once the respondents allow the applicants access to the computer and its contents, the applicants discover the records sought by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Accordingly, at this stage, I make no order for discovery of these documents by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 Emails (par 41 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 57 The respondents have stated that they have already discovered these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">58 In my view no order for discovery should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 Diary notes of telephone conversations (pars 41, 42, 43, 62, 63, 98, 105 Strahley affidavit) 
 
 59 The respondents have stated that they do not have any such documents in their possession, custody or power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">60 In my view no order for discovery should be made.</sentence>

 Communication between Strahley and Wheeler (par 42 Strahley affidavit)

 Hancock Board paper and Board minute evidencing decision to sell the orchards (pars 48 and 69(b) Strahley affidavit) 
 
 65 Paragraph 48 in the affidavit of Mr Strahley is as follows: 
 
 'On or about May 2004, Hancock decided to consider various options as to the future of the Property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By this stage, the Board of Hancock had reached the view that the Property was not performing in accordance with its return criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">' 
 
 66 In par 69(b) Mr Strahley deposes: 
 
 'During the course of the meeting, Mr Tracy asked me why Sunstate Orchards was selling the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">I said to him that the Board had made a decision to sell the Property based on past performance and it was no longer within the desired portfolio for Hancock as the company was moving away from citrus...' 
 
 67 In the table of responses, the respondents initially stated that the document was not relevant, but subsequently provided a copy of a document titled 'Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd Position Report April/May 2004'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The respondents also stated that they had no further such documents in their possession, custody or power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">68 The applicants submit that the document titled 'Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd Position Report April/May 2004' is a report to the Board, not a Board paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">69 The applicants in the table of responses claimed that the Hancock Board paper evidencing the decision to sell the orchards, together with all material upon which that decision was made, is relevant to proof of the reasonableness of the respondents' predictions as to the orchards' performance made to the applicants some months later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In their written submissions, the applicants claimed that documents of this kind at Board level fall within O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">70 In my view, Board papers, including minutes of meeting, as sought by the applicants fall within the criteria in O 15 rule 2(3) and are discoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 Corporate policy of Hancock in relation to valuation (par 49 of Strahley affidavit) 
 
 71 It appears that the respondents have endeavoured to provide this document, however the applicants claimed in the table of responses that parts of the document are illegible.</sentence>

 Communication between Breed and Strahley in relation to bin numbers (par 52 Strahley affidavit)

 Actual pack out rates (par 69(s) Strahley affidavit) 
 
 90 The respondents do not dispute the relevance of the document.</sentence>

<sentence id="s157">91 The respondents indicated in the table of responses that a hard copy of this file is in Mr Strahley's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The applicants press for a computerised version to determine the provenance of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">92 On the basis that a hard copy of the document has already been provided by the respondents, their claim that the request of the applicants is an interrogatory is not sustainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">93 The document in electronic form should be discovered by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 Employment Contract --- Matthew Burns; Notice of Resignation --- Matthew Burns; Copies of material provided by Andrew Strahley to Hancock Board; Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board from May 2004 
 
 94 While these documents may be discoverable, no submissions have been made by either the applicants or the respondents in relation to these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">My attention has not been directed to any reference to these documents in the affidavit of Mr Strahley or elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">95 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">
 Second Order sought 
 
 96 A large volume of material has been produced by the respondents since their List of Documents was filed on 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In my view it is clear that proper discovery has not been made by the respondents in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Indeed, following the production of a significant quantity of material in the days leading to trial, an unidentified proportion of which had not been previously discovered, the trial was adjourned, with resultant considerable inconvenience to all parties and this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">97 It is appropriate that the applicants be in a position where they can properly prosecute their claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Fairness requires that the respondents produce documentation in accordance with the Federal Court Rules , which includes a Supplementary List of Documents in Form 22 in the terms sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Accordingly, I am prepared to make the order in substantially the terms sought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">I note that this order will also address the document referred to as 'the First Budget' in the Schedule to the applicants' notice of motion, to which I have already referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">
 Third Order sought 
 
 98 I note the order sought by the applicants in this case in relation to the delay of the respondents in disclosing relevant documents, their failure to discover the documents in their List of Documents filed 29 March 2006 and/or by Supplementary List of Documents, and the fact that a large number of documents were disclosed immediately before trial, thus necessitating an adjournment of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">99 As I have already indicated, I have concerns about the approach taken by the respondents towards discovery in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">However, in my view it is important that the parties concentrate on preparation for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Little can be achieved at this point from requiring the respondents to depose on oath why they did not discover these documents earlier, and I agree with Mr McQuade that, at this point, it would not produce an effective result for the course of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">100 This is an issue which may however be relevant to costs in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In my view, it is best dealt with then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 Fourth order sought 
 
 101 I propose to make an order that costs be reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">
 The Second Notice of Motion 
 
 102 The respondents in the second notice of motion sought the following orders pursuant to O 15 Federal Court Rules : 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The applicants within 7 days provide discovery by list of the documents described in the attached schedule and inspection of those documents be provided within 14 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In the alternative, the applicants file an affidavit stating whether the document or any of the documents of that class is or has been in their possession, custody or power, when it was parted with and what has become of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The affidavit referred to in par 2 above be served on the first and second respondents within 14 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The time for service of the Notice of motion be abridged until a time no later than 4.00 pm, 20 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Any other Orders that this Honourable Court deems appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">103 In my view it is appropriate to deal with the subject of the first three orders sought by the respondents together, before turning to the remaining orders in their notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Mr McQuade on behalf of the respondents handed me a modified version of the Schedule during the hearing ('Schedule of Applicants' Undiscovered Documents'), indicating --- by bold font --- a number of documents for which the respondents no longer press.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The documents for which the respondents no longer press are, using the numbering in the schedule as follows: &#8226; Item 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Income Tax Returns for both first and second applicants for year ended 30 June 2006 &#8226; Item 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Trend line data constructed by second applicant &#8226; Item 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Email from David Breed to second applicant dated 28 February 2005 &#8226; Item 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Weekly reports for performance, picking, packing, dispatch and pricing, payments received and debtors listing for period from 21 March 2005 to 23 June 2005 &#8226; documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from documents discovered by the National Australia Bank Limited pursuant to Order dated 28 June 2006 and identified by the following numbers: 32, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">104 The balance of the Schedule is useful because it groups documents for which the respondents seek discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 Confidentiality Agreement between the First Respondent and the Second Applicant (Item 1) 
 
 105 This document is identified in the affidavit of the second respondent sworn 12 July 2006 par 83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The second respondent deposes: 
 
 'On Friday 10 December 2004, a meeting was held at Hancock's meeting room at 167 Eagle Street, Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">At the commencement of the meeting Mr Tracy, in my presence, signed a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement that I had previously sent to Mr Douglas on 6 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I also signed the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It was signed in duplicate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">I have undertaken an extensive search for the signed agreement and it cannot be located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">' 
 
 106 It is also identified in the affidavit of Mr Peter Douglas sworn 7 July 2006 par 39 where he deposes: 
 
 'On 6 December 2004 at about 2.33 pm, I sent Mr Tracy an email attaching a confidentiality agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">' 
 
 107 During the hearing the applicants submitted: &#8226; the document is the document of the respondents &#8226; it is not relevant to any contested allegation in the proceedings &#8226; they do not have an executed copy of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">108 The applicants further acknowledged that the confidentiality agreement may become relevant to the question of reliance because the document may contain an acknowledgment as to reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">109 In the circumstances, it is discoverable by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">
 Financial Documents held by Administrator of the Third Applicant (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12) 
 
 110 The third applicant is currently subject to a deed of company arrangement in accordance with Pt 5.3A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">As a general rule the administrator has control of the company's business, property and affairs (s 437A(1)(a)) , the powers of other officers of the company are suspended (s 437C) , and the administrator is entitled to all books and records of the company (s 438C).</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">If the company becomes subject to a deed of company arrangement, the affairs of the company are conducted according to the deed (s 444G).</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">111 In relation to the financial documents of the third applicant, the applicants state that these documents were seized by the administrator on his appointment on 23 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Accordingly, the applicants submit that the documents are not in their possession, but are in the possession of the administrator, and they cannot discover them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">112 The respondents submitted that a number of the applicants' responses to requests concerning the documents simply state that the documents are not in their possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The respondents further submit that if the applicants do not have the documents in their custody or power they should say so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The respondents also submit that if documents were in the applicants' possession, custody or power and no longer are, the applicants need to say so in the list of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">113 I do not understand the respondents to be submitting that all relevant financial records of the third applicant are not in the possession of the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In other words, I understand that the respondents are not claiming that the applicants have financial records, other than those in the possession of the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">114 However the respondents also submit that, in performing a function of the company under administration, the administrator is taken to be acting as the company's agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Accordingly, notwithstanding that the records have been seized by the administrator, they do not cease to be records of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The respondents therefore submit that those documents are discoverable by the third applicant and should be included in the list of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">115 There is no question that the administrator is the agent of the company to which he or she is appointed: s 437B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">However, as made clear by s 437A(1) , administrators have very extensive powers over all aspects of the company's business, property and affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Indeed as the High Court noted in Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 172 ALR 28 at 30, Div 3 of Pt 5.3A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) provides that the administrator of a company under administration is to assume control of the company's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">On the basis that the administrator had possession of the documents, the relationship of administrator and company as contemplated by Pt 5.3A Corporations Act does not permit the company other than with the consent of the administrator to have 'power' over documents retained by the administrator: s 438C (cf Lord Diplock's comments in Lonrho at 636H discussed earlier in this judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">116 Notwithstanding a submission by the respondents that 'Mr Tracy is responsible for the day to day management of the company', I note that the financial records were produced to the Court by the administrator by subpoena on 21 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">From this event, it is clear that the applicants do not have possession, custody or power over the records, other than as determined by the administrator in the exercise of his powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In circumstances where a company is under administration, an order for non-party discovery or subpoena is the appropriate order to require the production of documents in the possession of the administrator (cf Beach J in Hore-Lacy v David Syme and Co unreported Supreme Court of Victoria, 5 September 1996, BC9604308 p 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">117 Order 15 r 15 provides: 
 
 'The Court shall not make an order under this Order for the filing or service of any list of documents or affidavit or other document or for the production of any document unless satisfied that the order is necessary at the time when the order is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">' 
 
 118 In the circumstances the court would be imposing an artificial tier of disclosure to order the third applicant to disclose the financial records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">119 It follows that the answer of the applicants in relation to this request of the respondents, namely that they cannot make discovery of these documents, is the correct one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">
 Spray Records (Items 19 and 20) 
 
 120 Two issues arise in relation to these items, namely: &#8226; the dispute as to who has possession of these records &#8226; the issue as to the documents 'leading to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">121 The applicants and the respondents each claim that they are not in possession of these records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">122 The respondents however submit that the applicants plead that certain matters were revealed by the spray records which were not disclosed to the applicants; that the records have not been discovered; and that on settlement of the sale of the property the records remained at the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The respondents submit further that the applicants must have the documents as they have relied on information from them to plead the allegations in pars 17A(c) and (d) of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">123 In summary, the response of the applicants (other than that they do not have the documents in their possession) is that these are documents generated by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">124 In my view, the submissions of the respondents have merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The applicants have relied on these records --- if they were ever in their possession, custody or power but are no longer, it is appropriate for the applicants to state when this occurred and why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">125 However, as noted by the applicants, the respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents case or damage the applicants' case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The applicants submit that this submission, which is replicated throughout the Schedule, relates to a test of disclosure obsolete since 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">126 In my view it is not necessary to consider this issue in the context of these records, for reasons I have already explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">However, this issue is more relevant in respect of other documents for which discovery is sought, and I shall deal with it later in this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">
 TotalPak records (Items 2, 17, 22 and 30) 
 
 127 As submitted by the respondents, these documents are central to the applicants' case, and are the subject of pleadings in par 19 of the applicants' Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The respondents submit that, for this reason, they should be discovered by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">128 I note that item 22, which is grouped with the other TotalPak records, is addressed somewhat differently in the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">I also note that the applicants state that they currently do not have the documents in their possession, and that they are conducting searches at the orchards in an effort to locate any such documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">129 In relation to the documents comprised in item 22, which do not appear to have the same access issues as the documents in items 2, 17 and 30, it is appropriate that the documents be discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">130 I have already discussed the SmartPak and TotalPak records, which appear to be in items 2 and 17, in this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">131 The respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">In light of the view I take of these documents it is unnecessary to consider this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">132 The packout documents in item 30 are also on the computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">These should be dealt with in the same way as the SmartPak and TotalPak records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">
 The second applicant's 100 day plan (Item 14) 
 
 133 The applicants submit that they have already discovered this document and that it consists of two separate documents: &#8226; the 'Sunstate Orchards Acquisition Implementation Plan', and &#8226; the 'Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd kick off meeting Maryborough'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">134 The respondents however submit that the document described by the applicants as the '100 day plan' is not those documents, for two reasons: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">A witness, Mr James Palfreeman, deposed in his affidavit sworn 6 July 2006 that he was specifically shown a document described as a 100 day plan by the second applicant, and that the document consisted of a number of items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">I note in particular paragraphs 14 and 15 of that affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The documents which the applicants have identified as the 100 day plan refer in turn to: &#8226; in the case of the Sunstate Orchards Acquisition Implementation Plan --- 'develop and implement 100 day plan' &#8226; in the case of Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd kick off meeting Maryborough --- there are two references in the Action Items to (in relation to the Advisory Board visit) "100 day plan" and (in relation to the Management Meeting Process and content) 'Implementation of 100 day plan'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">135 The clear inference which may be drawn, in particular from the second reason (given that those documents actually refer to a document described as the '100 day plan'), is that there is a separate document which is the '100 day plan'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">136 Accordingly, it is necessary for the applicants to discover this document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">137 The respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The applicants submit that this submission of the respondents, which is replicated throughout the Schedule, relates to a test of disclosure obsolete since 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In my view however it is not necessary to consider this issue in the context of this document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Leaving aside the issue of exact identification, there does not appear to be any contest by the applicants that the '100 day plan' should be discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">138 Before turning to consider other documents in the Schedule which were not the subject of written submissions, it is appropriate to deal with the issue of discovery sought on the grounds that the document 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">
 'Train of Inquiry' (Items 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 50, 55, 56, 58) 
 
 139 I have already noted this issue in relation to items 14, 19, 20, 22 and 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">In relation to these items however, it was unnecessary to consider this issue on the basis that: &#8226; in relation to item 14, the issue was not whether the document should be discovered, but whether it had been discovered &#8226; in relation to items 19, 20, 22 and 30 in my view it was clear that the documents fell within O 15 r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">140 The other documents listed however, namely those referred to in items 13, 15, 21, 27, 28, 50, 55, 56 and 58, also refer to this test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">141 During the hearing this issue was the subject of some contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Counsel for both parties have since filed supplementary submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">142 In essence, the submissions of the applicants are as follows: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Order 15 r 2(3) sets out the criteria by which the obligation to disclose might be tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Those criteria do not include documents leading to a train of inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">That was the test before the rules were amended in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Order 15 r 2 should be interpreted according to its terms; and the 'train of inquiry' test (as articulated in the leading case of The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55 per Brett LJ at 63, note also Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 345) has no place in that context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">General discovery is that which occurs under O 15 r 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Order 15 r 8 entitles a court to make an order wider than that apprehended under O 15 r 2, however only where an application is made under O 15 r 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">In terms of the Federal Court Rules and Practice Note 14, the order made by the Court on 15 February 2006 was an order apprehended under O 15 r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">143 The submissions of the respondents may be summarised as: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The order of 15 February 2006 was 'The applicants and the respondents make discovery by verified List of Documents and file and serve such List of documents on or before 4.00 pm on 29 March 2006'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">2.</sentence>

<sentence id="s287">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Order 15 r 2 continues to authorise orders for general discovery, and although the court would not ordinarily make an order for general discovery it may consider it appropriate to do so, in which case the traditional obligations to discovery any document relating to a matter in question in the proceeding continues to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Pursuant to O 15 r 8 the court may make orders requiring discovery of a document or class of documents 'relating to a matter in question in the proceeding' that may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">An order of the court that the parties give discovery, without any further limitation , is a general order or direction for discovery.</sentence>

<sentence id="s297">Alternatively, the court may order a document or class of documents be discovered by affidavit in terms of O 15 r 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">144 The current version of O 15 r 2 was introduced into the Rules by SR 295 of 1999 Schedule 1, and became effective 3 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">On the same day Practice Note 14 was issued by the Chief Justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">This Practice Note states, inter alia , that: &#8226; the general position is that the Court will not order general discovery as a matter of course &#8226; the Court will mould any order for discovery to suit the facts of a particular case &#8226; in determining whether to order discovery the Court will have regard to the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the resources and circumstances of the parties, the likely cost of the discovery and its likely benefit &#8226; to prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case, orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">145 There seems no doubt that, as a result of the 1999 amendments to O 15 r 2, the criteria in O 15 r 2(3) superseded the 'train of inquiry' test as the usual requirements for discovery.</sentence>

 (note also Finn J in South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd [2000] FCA 519 at par 10, The Hon Justice JW von Doussa 'Discovery in the Federal Court' Law Society of South Australia and the Federal Litigation Section Seminar, 14 March 2000; Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563 pars 4-8; Aveling v UBS Australia Capital Markets Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 at par 10).</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 146 The history to the amendment to O 15 r 2(3) was explained by Lindgren J in Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">His Honour in that case also observed that the broader test of 'relating to any matter in question in the proceeding', which derives from the Peruvian Guano case, continues to be used in the context of O 15 r 8 (par 6 of Spyer ), and that in this respect there is a disconformity between the tests of discoverability as between O 15 r 2(3) and r 8 (par 7 of Spyer ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">147 In Aveling v UBS Australia Capital Markets Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 , Lindgren J considered the principles which should guide the parties in identifying categories of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">His Honour observed that they were the same principles which guide the Court when ordering discovery, and continued: 
 
 'It may be appropriate for parties to describe categories in terms which do not expressly incorporate the language of O 15 r 2(3), but that subrule should nonetheless govern the formulation of the categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Alternatively, of course, the categories may be defined so as to incorporate expressly the terms of the subrule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Whatever approach is taken, it is important to understand that when, as happened in the present case, the Court orders discovery by categories to be notified by one party to another, the Court does not intend that the notifying party be at liberty to widen the discovery obligation beyond the four classes of documents referred to in O 15 r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">' (par 11) 
 
 148 More recently, Lindgren J had cause to consider the operation of O 15 r 2(3) in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd (2005) FCA 366.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Significantly, after reciting r 2(3), his Honour said at par 23: 
 
 'In the rare case in which the Court grants leave to a party to give a notice requiring general discovery, that subrule operates, rather than, as formerly, the Peruvian Guano test, to identify the discoverable documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Federal Court Amendments Rules 1999 (No 6) (SR 1999 No 295) stated of the new subrule 2(3) that '[t]he aim of the rule is to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">' 
 
 149 The history of the law in this area, and more recent cases, indicates that 'general discovery' means an unqualified or unlimited order for discovery, possibly in one of the following forms: &#8226; as noted by Beaumont J in Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll &amp; Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109 at 70, quoting Butterworths Practice &amp; Procedure of the Federal Court at [40.760] --- 'general discovery as traditionally understood'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">This refers to discovery of any document which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry, as per the Peruvian Guano test, and is consistent with the submissions of the respondent; or &#8226; as submitted by the applicants, 'general discovery' as is now contemplated by O 15 r 2(3) (The court may make an order for particular discovery in broader terms under O 15 r 8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">150 In my view, in the absence of qualifications or limitations to an order for discovery, the correct interpretation is that the discovery ordered by the Federal Court pursuant to O 15 is that contemplated by O 15 r 2(3), as submitted by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Clearly this will not be the case if the Court makes an order pursuant to O 15 r 8, which, as pointed out by Lindgren J in Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563 , seems to countenance a continuation of the broader test of discoverability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">151 This interpretation is consistent with: &#8226; Order 15 r 5, which is titled ' Order for General Discovery ', and provides: 
 
 'The Court may, at any stage of the proceeding, order any party to give discovery in accordance with rule 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">' 


 
 &#8226; the amendments to O 15 r 2 in 1999, the aim of which, according to the Explanatory Statement Statutory Rules 1999 No 295, was 'to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings' (note also Advanced Medical Institute per Lindgren J at par 23) &#8226; Practice Note 14, which states that orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3) &#8226; Order 15 r 8 which continues to use the language of Peruvian Guano but only in the context of particular discovery and &#8226; the authority of cases to which I have already referred, in particular Spyer , Aveling and Advanced Medical Institute .</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">152 The respondents have referred to comments of Beaumont J in Reading Entertainment at par 70 concerning the court ordering general discovery following the 1999 amendments, however in my view his Honour's observations were referable to extraordinary circumstances where the courts may order discovery in accordance with the Peruvian Guano test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Although his Honour did not give the example, an order pursuant to O 15 r 8 would be an instance of such a circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">153 The consent order made on 15 February 2006 was in my view an unqualified order for general discovery, as contemplated by O 15 r 5, and requiring discovery of documents as contemplated by O 15 r 2, in particular subrule 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Accordingly, the 'train of inquiry' test as posed by the respondents in this case is not applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">154 It is appropriate to consider the remaining documents in the Schedule where this test is sought to be applied, in that light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">
 Other documents in the Schedule (Items 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 37, 39, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58) 
 
 155 Other documents as listed in the Schedule were not the subject of written submissions by counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The Schedule does however provide a summary of the communications between the applicants and the respondents on the issue of discovery of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">
 Item 10 Rain data records 
 
 156 In seeking discovery of these documents, which are identified as rain data records of the first or second applicant in respect of the Bundaberg and Tairo Orchards, the respondents claim they are relevant to loss and damage, and cite par 21 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 30 of the Defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">157 In support of this contention the respondents rely on statements of Sheppard and Pincus JJ in Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">This case also involved an application under s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the sale of a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The majority of the Full Court said: 
 
 'We reiterate that, where a purchase has been induced by misleading conduct, it is not enough, in order to recover losses subsequent to the purchase, to prove that but for the misleading conduct or as a partial consequence of it, the agreement to purchase would not have been made; that is so in every successful application of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">It is not the law that in every such case the party held to have been engaged in misleading conduct (who may have acted quite innocently) becomes the insurer of the other's success and prima facie liable to indemnify him against the consequences of the purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">As the trial judge said in the present case: 
 
 "To recover a loss sustained in the business, the applicant must show more than that it was sustained in the conduct of that business; for to show only that is to establish what is perfectly consistent with the loss having arisen from his own misguided management decisions, or even total neglect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">"' 
 
 158 I agree with this reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">159 The applicants state that: &#8226; records up to 22 March 2005 are in the possession of the respondents already and are not required to be discovered by the applicants &#8226; the applicants do not have records after 22 March 2005, but they may be with the Administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">160 Unfortunately the respondents have not specifically indicated how these documents satisfy the criteria under by O 15 r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">To the extent that the applicants are required to prove their case --- as explained by the Full Court in Netaf --- the rain data records appear to be documents which fall within r 2(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The response of the applicants does not suggest a dispute that the documents are discoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">161 However, the applicants have stated that these documents up to 22 March 2005 are already in the possession of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">This is not denied by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">In my view, O 15 r 2(4) applies in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">It is difficult to know what further could be achieved by requiring the applicants to discover the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">162 Unless there is some further reason why the applicants should provide discovery of those documents, it is unnecessary to make an order requiring them to do so (note recent similar comments of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2006] FCA 737 at par 31).</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">163 In relation to the documents after 22 March 2005, on the basis that the documents are in the possession, custody or power of the administrator, in my view the applicants are not required to discover them for the reasons I have already explained in relation to documents held by the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">
 Item 13 Westpac and ANZ documents and correspondence 
 
 164 I note that the respondents have stated that this documentation will lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">I have already held that this test is not applicable in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">165 The respondents state that the documents are relevant to reliance, and point to par 18 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 17 of the Defence.</sentence>

<sentence id="s347">
 Item 15 Copies of all cash flow 
 
 167 I note that the respondents have stated that this documentation will lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I have already held that this test is not applicable in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">168 However the applicants in their letter of 5 July 2006 offered to provide the documents to the respondent if the respondents identified any relevant contested matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">The respondents have identified par 18 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 17 of the Defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">I do not understand that the applicants are disputing the discoverability of the documents in relation to the contested allegations identified by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">169 Accordingly, these documents should be discovered.</sentence>

 Item 16 Creditors invoices for first applicant 
 
 170 The respondents have identified par 21 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 30 of the Defence as contested allegations forming the basis of an order for discovery.</sentence>

<sentence id="s355">171 Accordingly, I order the documents to be discovered.</sentence>

 Item 18 Email from David Breed to the second applicant 
 
 172 There appears some dispute over whether this document has already been discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The applicants submit that it has been discovered, however the respondents submit that the document cannot be identified in the applicants' List of Documents filed 13 April 2006, and they are unable to identify whether this document has been discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">173 Otherwise, there does not appear to be any dispute as to whether this document should be discovered.</sentence>

 Item 21 Management reports for the Orchards and Packing shed 
 
 175 In relation to management reports up to 22 March 2005 it appears that the documents are the documents of the respondents and are in their possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">This is not denied by the respondents.</sentence>

<sentence id="s363">176 In relation to the management reports between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005, the respondents claimed they would lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case.</sentence>

<sentence id="s365">177 However, the respondents in relation to documents between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005 also claim that the documents are relevant to loss or damage claimed by the second and third applicants as to causation and measure of loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The respondents rely on the Netaf case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">In my view these documents fall within the scope of O 15 r 2(3) and should be discovered by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">
 Item 25 Third applicant's orchard management plans 
 
 178 There does not appear to be any dispute that this document, if it exists, should be discovered.</sentence>

<sentence id="s370">On the basis that, as submitted by the respondents, documents of that class are referred to in other documents discovered by the applicants in the circumstances, the appropriate order is that the applicants advise the respondents whether the document is in their custody or power, and if it is, the applicants should discover it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">
 Items 26, 27 and 28 Cash flows, correspondence and emails 
 
 179 As submitted by the respondents, the applicants do not suggest that these documents are not discoverable.</sentence>

<sentence id="s373">As at the hearing date of this matter, it appears that they had not been discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">180 The appropriate order is that, if the applicants have the documents in their possession, custody or power, they should discover them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">
 Item 31 Email of 12 January 2005 
 
 181 Although the respondents do not identify this document in the schedule as a document for which discovery is no longer pressed, the fact that the applicants appear to have provided a copy of this document indicates that an order for discovery is not necessary (O 15 r 15).</sentence>

<sentence id="s390">This list comprises item 57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from the applicants' discovered document titled 'Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd Kick Off Meeting'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">This list comprises item 58.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">183 It is not clear to me whether the respondents have these documents already as a result of previous discovery, although the applicants suggested at the hearing that that was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">184 Mr Perry for the applicants submitted that it is a matter of concern that, at least in respect of some of the documents it appears that the respondents may have had them since 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Alternatively, if the respondents do not have the documents, it seems that in relation to such documents the respondents have had the opportunity since 29 March 2006 to seek discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">185 It does not appear that these items have been the subject of previous correspondence between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">As a consequence of this, there are few grounds submitted by the respondents as the basis of discovery, and no responses from the applicants in relation to discovery of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">To the extent that I can interpret the Schedule, the only grounds submitted as a basis for discovery of these documents are: &#8226; in relation to items 33, 34, 37, 41 and 46: they are relevant to allegations in issue and reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case &#8226; there are no grounds asserted in relation to items 47, 48 and 49 &#8226; in relation to items 50, 51, 52, 53: these classes of documents are relevant to allegations in issue as to reliance and loss or damage.</sentence>

 Conclusion 
 
 191 Practice Note 14 indicates that orders for discovery should be moulded to suit the facts of a particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The history of this case indicates that supplementary discovery is clearly necessary, particularly, it appears, by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It is important however, in the interests of the parties and the conduct of this matter, to allow the parties a realistic time frame in which to comply with their obligations under the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">192 It is also in my view important to ensure that the parties, so far as possible, are on an even footing in relation to available evidence, their obligations to discover relevant material, and to paraphrase Tamberlin J in KC v Shiley Inc , are not surprised by new material unexpectedly appearing.</sentence>
