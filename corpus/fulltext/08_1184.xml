<sentence id="s0">
 
1 There is a nice dispute between Mrs Muir and the deed administrator about costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 In their respective submissions each side takes the position that he or she was substantially successful in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mrs Muir claims success on the basis that the deed administrator was unable to establish that she was a party to the improper purpose that motivated her late husband to get rid of TEAC's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Yet, she failed in her attempt to keep from inspection all her documents that would otherwise be protected by legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">For his part, the deed administrator contends that he was largely successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">His argument is that he won at least in a practical sense because he got his hands on most of the documents over which privilege had been claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The parties' approach seems to be an example of the so-called Rashomon effect, after Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950): see eg W D Roth and J D Mehta, "The Rashomon Effect: Combining Positivist and Interpretivist Approaches in the Analysis of Contested Events" (2002) 31 Sociological Methods &amp; Research 131.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That is, the parties are engaging in what sociologists describe as an interpretivist approach to an event (in this case litigation), in which they do not seek an objective truth but instead unravel the meaning of what has occurred through their version of the truth as shaped by their understanding and perception of the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 Under our legal system a judge is required to adopt a positivist approach and search for a true explanation of an event, an explanation which can be tested by some scientific or intellectual standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">(I say nothing about the capacity of a judge to meet that standard).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Applying the positivist standard, I am compelled to the conclusion that each party has had both a measure of success and a measure of failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">So it is only fair that each party should bear his and her own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 Accordingly, the costs order previously made will be recalled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In lieu thereof I will order that "The plaintiff's costs be paid by Gavin Muir Pty Ltd and Ashley Muir".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
