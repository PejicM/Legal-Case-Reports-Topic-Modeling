 (first and second hearings) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By its originating process, the plaintiff, Stork ICM Australia Pty Ltd ('Stork ICM') sought:
 
&#8226; an order pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act') that Stork ICM convene meetings of its four classes of shareholders ('the Scheme Meetings') to consider, and if thought fit, to agree, with or without modification, to approve a scheme of arrangement proposed between Stork ICM and its shareholders ('the Scheme');
 
&#8226; an order pursuant to s 411(4)(b) of the Act that the Scheme be approved;
 
&#8226; such orders pursuant to s 413 of the Act as the circumstances may require;
 
&#8226; an order pursuant to s 411(12) of the Act that Stork ICM be exempted from compliance with s 411(11) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 On 14 September 2006, I made the order for the convening of the four Scheme Meetings to be held, for reasons that will appear, on the same day, 14 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The meetings were held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At each meeting the shareholder or the shareholders of the relevant class (see [14] below), acting through their attorney-appointed representatives, by unanimous vote, agreed to approve the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 In relation to the other orders sought, the proceeding took an unusual course, as referred to below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In the event, I made orders on 14 December 2006 approving the Scheme subject to an alteration which is explained below and appears in the attached orders of that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 The present reasons are my reasons both for the order that the Scheme Meetings be held and for the final orders made on 14 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 The case presents some unusual features --- unusual by reference to many applications that come before the Court concerning the acquisition, under Pt 5.1 of the Act, of all the shares in publicly listed companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The unusual features are that:
 
&#8226; Stork ICM and the proposed transferee company, Stork Food Systems Australasia Pty Ltd ('Stork FSA'), and their shareholders are all part of the Stork group of companies based in the Netherlands, Stork ICM and Stork FSA being both ultimately wholly owned by Stork NV;
 
&#8226; In 2003, Stork ICM sold its business assets, including shares in its subsidiaries, to an unrelated company, Downer RML Pty Ltd, and since that time Stork ICM has not carried on business;
 
&#8226; By the Scheme, the property and liabilities of Stork ICM will be transferred to Stork FSA and Stork ICM will be deregistered without being wound up;
 
&#8226; Stork ICM seeks orders under s 413 of the Act directed to ensuring that Stork FSA will have the benefit of insurances held by Stork ICM, in respect of all and any personal injury claims yet to be made by Stork ICM's former employees and contractors arising out of their exposure to asbestos fibres while they were working for, or providing services to, Stork ICM ('potential claimants').</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The reason why the Scheme is being propounded is that under Dutch tax law, Stork NV will have the benefit of tax losses attributable to its investment in Stork ICM, upon the deregistration of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">7 To adopt insurance terminology, Stork ICM is, and has been for some time, in 'run off', dealing with claims arising out of its earlier business activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Of particular importance are the incurred but not reported claims of the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 A key objective of the present application, as originally conceived, was to ensure that, by reason of the making of orders under s 413 of the Act:
 
&#8226; Stork ICM's liability to the potential claimants would cease to be a liability of Stork ICM and would become a liability of Stork FSA; and
 
&#8226; Stork ICM's right to insurance indemnity in respect to that liability would cease to be a right of Stork ICM and would become a right of Stork FSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">9 As will appear later, however, there seems to have been an initial misconception that it was necessary that Stork ICM be denuded of all its assets and liabilities before it could be deregistered, and before Stork NV could obtain the benefit of the sought tax deduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Once it became clear that this was not the case, the present proceeding took a somewhat different course, as will be explained below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">10 Because Stork ICM and its shareholders are within the Stork group, it was a foregone conclusion that the shareholders would agree to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The case is therefore not the familiar one in which a key objective of a Pt 5.1 arrangement is to ensure that all shareholders are bound by the arrangement as if they were parties to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Stork ICM's only two shareholders, Stork International BV and Stork NV, waived the requirement that due notice be given to them of the Scheme Meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was for this reason that the Scheme Meetings were able to be held on the same day as the making of the order for the convening of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">11 Pursuant to leave, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') appeared as amicus curiae on the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">12 ASIC properly took an even-handed approach, and drew the Court's attention to a possible concern as to whether the desired result, that the insurers would become liable to indemnify Stork FSA in respect of transferred liabilities of Stork ICM to claimants, could be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I was concerned, however, to ensure that any arguments against the Scheme, or for a variation of it, exclusively in the interests of the potential claimants , should be put to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">To this end, I directed that the Registrar approach the New South Wales Bar Association to seek counsel to put any such arguments, and that Stork ICM pay such counsel's reasonable fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Ms L McCallum SC undertook that role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">For her assistance, and that of Mr M B Oakes SC for the parties and Mr P Whiford SC and Ms V McWilliam of counsel for ASIC, I am grateful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">GENERAL BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
13 Stork ICM was registered in Victoria, as a proprietary company limited by shares, on 31 August 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It was then called 'World Services and Construction Proprietary Limited'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Its name was changed in 1996 and again in 1997, on the latter occasion to its present name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">14 Stork ICM has four classes of shares on issue:
 1,000 A class shares all held by Stork International BV 50,000 B class shares one held by Stork NV and the remaining 49,999 held by Stork International BV 6,299,000 C class shares all held by Stork International BV 16,000 D class shares all held by Stork International BV 

Stork International BV is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stork NV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">15 The directors of Stork ICM are Mark Andrew Hinschen of Singapore, Karl Heinz Kroeger of Cherrybrook, New South Wales, and Willem Henk Peters of the Netherlands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">16 Before the sale of the business to Downer RML Pty Ltd in 2003, Stork ICM's principal activity was that of mechanical and electrical engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Stork ICM was involved in the construction of petro-chemical plants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As a result, it has been named a defendant in legal proceedings in respect of asbestos-related personal injury claims, generally as a co-defendant with other companies for which the claimant may have worked during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Most of the claims originated in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">17 Apart from the potential claimants, Stork ICM has only one other creditor or potential creditor, namely, Cook's Construction Pty Ltd ('Cook').</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Stork ICM is currently involved in litigation with Cook in the Supreme Court of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Cook is suing Stork ICM for $1,398,241.10 plus costs and interest, in relation to alleged breaches of contract in connection with the construction of the Ammonia Nitrate Gas Plant at Moura, Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Stork ICM is defending the claim and counter claiming against Cook for $12,246,466.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The proceeding is in its interlocutory stages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Stork ICM has provided security for costs (there is in evidence a bank guarantee for $2,200,000) and has recently undertaken to increase the amount of the security by $800,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">18 Apart from the potential liability to Cook and the potential claimants, Stork ICM has no creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, it has ongoing expenses in connection with its continued existence as a corporate entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In an affidavit sworn 19 September 2006, Mr Hinschen identified these as follows:
 
 (a) expenses connected with the storage of Stork ICM's business records (for which it had not been invoiced at the date of Mr Hinschen's affidavit);
 (b) rechargeable courier expenses of $105.66 which Stork ICM had paid by a cheque, that had not been presented for payment at the date of his affidavit;
 (c) legal expenses associated with the asbestos-related claims referred to below, for some of which Stork ICM had not been invoiced at the date of the affidavit;
 (d) legal expenses associated with the Cook litigation (Stork ICM received an invoice for $81,773.14 which was paid by a cheque that remained unpresented at the date of Mr Hinschen's affidavit);
 (e) the legal and other third party expenses associated with the present proceeding (at the date of Mr Hinschen's affidavit, Stork ICM had received invoices totalling $64,250, which it had paid by cheques that remained unpresented at the date of Mr Hinschen's affidavit); and
 (f) auditing expenses, for which Stork ICM had not been invoiced at the date of Mr Hinschen's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

19 The proposed transferee, Stork FSA, was registered in Victoria as a company limited by shares on 4 September 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Its principal activities are the development, production and maintenance of poultry processing machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">20 At the time of ordering the convening of the Scheme Meetings, I made it clear that I was reserving for consideration on the occasion when the issue of the Court's approval of the Scheme arose, the question whether orders should be made under s 413 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">FINANCIAL POSITIONS OF STORK ICM, STORK FSA, AND STORK NV 
 Stork ICM 
 
21 Stork ICM's financial report for the year ended 31 December 2005 is in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It must be remembered that during that year, Stork ICM was not trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The income statement for the year showed a profit of $316,334, which decreased the deficiency in shareholders' equity from $9,652,469 as at 31 December 2004 to $9,336,135 as at 31 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">22 Of greater importance for present purposes are the figures in Stork ICM's balance sheet as at 31 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The balance sheet shows a 'provision' of $5,800,000 and a 'receivable' of the same amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The provision was for 'non-pending asbestos related disease claims' and the receivable represented an indemnity from Stork NV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Notes 13(b) and (c) to the balance sheet explain:
 
 '(b) Asbestos related disease claims 
 
 In prior years the Company was an engineering Company which specialized in shut down work particularly in the petrochemical industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Company's historic involvement with asbestos took place during occupational activities of its employees in the 1960's and 70's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As a result of these activities, the Company has been named as a defendant in litigation in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">At the date of this report the Company has been involved in a total of 16 claims of which 4 are pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 A provision for non-pending asbestos related disease claims of $5.8 million ... has been recorded in 31 December 2005, being the Directors' central estimate based on independent actuarial expert advice, in relation to possible future incidence and value of asbestos related disease claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Directors' central estimate is the discounted central value of a range of potential outcomes obtained from sensitivity testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The undiscounted value of the Directors' central estimate, based on independent actuarial advice, is $10.2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">A prudential margin is not included in the measurement of the provision, as the small volume of claims data is an insufficient basis in quantifying the additional amount of provision that would achieve certain specified probabilities of sufficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Estimates of asbestos related disease claims are subject to considerable uncertainty and actual liabilities for such claims could vary, perhaps materially, from the Directors' central estimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The assessment made of the central estimate value of these claims is based on various techniques and assumptions to project a range of potential outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The Company will use the Directors' central estimate, based on independent actuarial expert advice and calculated in accordance with Australian Actuarial Standards, as a benchmark for the ongoing monitoring of the liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 
 
 (c) Ultimate holding company indemnity in respect of the asbestos related disease claims 
 
 
 
 Included in the Company's 31 December 2005 balance sheet is a corresponding non-current receivable of $5.8 million ... being an indemnity provided by the Company's ultimate holding company, Stork NV, in respect of the Company's exposure to non-pending asbestos related disease claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The indemnity is conditional on certain events taking place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 The Directors emphasise that whilst they expect the conditions attached to the indemnity will be met, enabling the Company to meet its obligations in respect of the asbestos related disease claims, it is not virtually certain the conditions will be met and therefore uncertainty exists regarding the eventual receipt of proceeds from the indemnity resulting in an uncertainty as to whether the non-current receivable will be recovered at the amount recorded in the 31 December 2005 balance sheet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 
 Deeds of Indemnity 
 
23 The particular indemnity referred to in the above extract from the 2005 financial statements of Stork ICM is not in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, there are in evidence a Deed of Indemnity dated 29 June 2006, between Stork NV and Stork ICM and a Deed of Amendment of it dated 11 December 2006 (together, 'the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity'), which was entered into in contemplation of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">This indemnity has a higher ceiling --- $12,300,000 rather than the $5,800,000 referred to in the 2005 financial statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">24 The limit of $12,300,000 fixed in the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity is based on a report of KPMG Actuaries Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The KPMG report is dated 28 July 2006, and is described as being 'effective as at 30 April 2006'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The report is verified by Neil Francis Donlevy, who is a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries (London) and a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The report contains an estimate of the likely amount of Stork ICM's liability to the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The estimate is heavily qualified, however, by warnings as to the uncertainty affecting any attempt to quantify such a liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">25 The following table from Mr Donlevy's report gives a summary of his central estimate liability assessment, excluding pending claims:
 
 Undiscounted 
 ($m) Discounted 
 ($m) 
 Gross Liability 
 38.3 
 18.8 Workers Compensation Insurance Recoveries -12.8 -6.5 Recoveries from Workcover schemes -13.2 -5.6 Subtotal 12.3 6.7 Abnormal loss allowance 3.0 1.5 XL Re protection -5.1 -2.4 Retained Liability 10.2 5.8 

 
26 David John Finnis, a principal actuary employed by Professional Financial Solutions Pty Ltd, has provided a report entitled 'External Peer Review of KPMG Actuaries' Work in Assessing Potential Asbestos Claim Exposures of Stork ICM', in which Mr Finnis concludes that the methodology and choice of assumptions used by Mr Donlevy are appropriate, as is his use of the 'central estimate' as the accounting entry for the liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">27 Of course, Mr Finnis's opinion does not overcome the warnings sounded in Mr Donlevy's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">28 By the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity, Stork NV indemnifies Stork ICM for any amounts paid or payable by Stork ICM on account of any asbestos-related claim to the extent of an aggregate limit of $12,300,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">As can be seen from the above table, this is the undiscounted subtotal referred to in the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The notion of an asbestos-related claim is defined to mean a claim concerning asbestos exposure resulting from a claimant's employment by Stork ICM, the provision of services to Stork ICM (each, an 'Exposed Person'), any indirect exposure to asbestos resulting from the Exposed Person's exposure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Stork NV acknowledges and agrees that the benefit of the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity transfers to Stork FSA on the implementation of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Stork NV undertakes to honour its indemnity within 30 days of receipt by it from Stork ICM or Stork FSA, as the case may be, of a statement of costs and charges for an asbestos-related claim, supported by documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The indemnity is to have effect from the date on which the Court approves the Scheme, and to cease to have effect on 31 December 2037.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">29 By a Deed Poll dated 7 September 2006, Stork FSA has covenanted in favour of all 'asbestos related claimants' not to do various things which would have the effect of terminating, amending, varying or assigning the (transferred) benefit of the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The expression 'asbestos related claimant' is defined to mean any person who has or may have an asbestos-related claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The expression 'asbestos related claim' is defined to mean a claim concerning asbestos exposure resulting from the claimant's employment by Stork ICM, the provision of services to Stork ICM (each, an 'Exposed Person'), or any indirect exposure of a person to an Exposed Person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Stork FSA does not, however, promise the potential claimants that it will enforce the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity if and when requested to do so by any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">30 Stork NV has entered into a further Deed of Indemnity dated 19 September 2006 with Stork FSA ('the Stork FSA Deed of Indemnity').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It is generally similar to the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity but is subject to the slightly higher aggregate ceiling of $12,800,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Its definition of 'asbestos-related claim' is a little different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The expression is defined to mean a claim concerning asbestos exposure resulting from the claimant's employment by Stork ICM or the provision of services to Stork ICM, that would, but for the Scheme, have been recoverable (at least in part) under statutory workers' compensation scheme insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">31 Stork NV has released $200,000 of a debt of $1,600,000, and the whole of a debt of $8,800,000, owed to it by Stork ICM, by a deed of release dated 20 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Accordingly, these amounts are not liabilities that will be transferred to Stork FSA under the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">32 There are in evidence letters of comfort from Stork NV to the directors of both Stork ICM and Stork FSA, undertaking to provide necessary financial support to enable the relevant company to pay all its debts as and when they become due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">However, the promise is revocable by Stork NV, and is, in any event, enforceable at the will of the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I place no weight on the letters of comfort as a protection for the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">33 While the Stork ICM and Stork FSA Deeds of Indemnity may be seen to afford to the potential claimants an indirect benefit that they do not have at present, they are problematical from the viewpoint of the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">First, and obviously, the limit of $12,300,000 may prove to be too low.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Second, they are enforceable by Stork ICM and Stork FSA respectively --- both wholly owned subsidiaries of Stork NV, the indemnifier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Third, I do not know whether Stork NV has realisable assets in Australia, and, even if it does, there is no assurance that it would have assets here at any time when any question of enforcement arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In effect, Stork FSA may have to enforce the indemnity against its parent in the Netherlands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">34 It may be that Stork NV would honour its obligations under the Deeds of Indemnity, but I do not rely on them, when considering the position of the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Stork FSA 
 
35 Stork FSA's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, and its management accounts for the six months to 30 June 2006, are both in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The balance sheet shows, as at 31 December 2005, total assets of $1,956,532, and total liabilities of $1,222,783, giving net assets of $733,749 (being also the 'total shareholders' equity').</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005 shows a net profit from ordinary activities, after income tax expenses, of $84,803.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">36 Stork FSA appears to be in a more sound financial position than does Stork ICM, but I do not place great weight on this fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Circumstances can change, particularly in the case of a trading company over such a lengthy period as that during which asbestos related injury can reveal itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Stork NV 
 
37 The annual report for 2005 of Stork NV describes Stork NV as having 'a history of 179 years, making it one of the oldest companies in the Netherlands'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Its consolidated balance sheet shows it as having assets of &#8364;1,343,661,000, current and non-current liabilities of &#8364;797,111,000, and shareholders' equity of &#8364;546,550,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">CLAIMS MADE TO DATE 
 
38 At September 2006, 11 claims have been made against Stork ICM arising out of asbestos-related injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">All have been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In some cases, Stork ICM has cross-claims outstanding against other entities that it alleges are liable to contribute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The 11 claims may be summarised as follows:

<sentence id="s126">Contribution to the settlement, including costs, was divided equally between Stork ICM, Shell, and the suppliers, Amaca and Wallaby Grip.</sentence>

47 The general liability insurer of Stork ICM is the Dutch insurer, XL Insurance Company Ltd ('XL').</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">On 13 March 2006, XL provided to Stork NV a letter confirming that, if the Scheme was implemented, the benefit of the general liability insurance policy, according to its terms and conditions, would be available to Stork FSA, for so long as it remained an affiliate of Stork NV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">48 There are in evidence the terms of the 'employers' indemnity policy' under the Workers' Compensation Act 1958 (Vic) and the Workers' Compensation Act 1926 (NSW) and Regulations under those respective Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In each case, there is the following provision:
 
 'No assignment of interest under this Policy shall bind the Insurer unless the written consent of the Insurer is endorsed hereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">' 
 

The relationship between this 'no assignment without consent' provision and s 413 was debated at some length on the hearing (see below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">49 Two workers' compensation insurers in respect of New South Wales employees call for special comment: Bishopsgate Insurance Co Ltd ('Bishopsgate') (1 December 1971 to 30 November 1972), and NEM (1 December 1972 to 28 February 1980).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Both are in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">50 As a result of these two collapses, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation, the effect of which may be generally stated as being that neither an employer nor an employee should be left without remedy as the result of the collapse of a workers' compensation insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The remedy was to create a statutory fund and to provide a discretion to make payments from the fund where the insurer was in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">51 The Bishopsgate collapse was addressed by Bishopsgate Insurance Australia Limited Act 1983 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However, the remedy provided by that Act was later incorporated into Division 7 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) ('the 1987 Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">By s 281 and Sch 5 of the 1987 Act, the Workers Compensation Act 1926 was repealed, but certain transitional and savings provisions were made by s 282 and Sch 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Claims are now made under the 1987 Act in respect of injuries received prior to its commencement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">52 Division 7 of Pt 7 of the 1987 Act provides for the establishment of an Insurers' Guarantee Fund ('IGF').</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">In order for Div 7 to be enlivened, the Minister may declare under s 226 an insurer to be an 'insolvent insurer' for the purposes of the Division.</sentence>

<sentence id="s167">Section 229 of the 1987 Act requires a liquidator of an insolvent insurer to send claims on to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Section 231 vests in the Authority, as agent and attorney, certain powers to operate on behalf of the employer and the worker in relation to a policy of insurance, and s 232 empowers the Authority to pay, from the IGF, an employer or liquidator who has paid a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Payment is, however, discretionary: s 232(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Section 236 provides that where an insolvent insurer is dissolved, an insured employer has direct access to the IGF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The IGF is not an insurer, but is a statutory fund that operates on its own principles established by the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">53 The evidence shows that numerous searches have been conducted on behalf of Stork ICM into its current and past insurance records, with a view to identifying its insurers from time to time in relation to asbestos-related liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">These searches have identified only GIO General Limited ('GIO'), Allianz, Zurich, and, in respect of Bishopsgate and NEM, CMS as appointee of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Stork ICM's solicitors wrote to those four companies requesting copies of any policies held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">All four replied to the effect they could not locate any policy.</sentence>

<sentence id="s177">54 On 6 September 2006, Stork ICM wrote to GIO, Allianz, Zurich, and CMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The letter advised them that Stork ICM's records indicated that the addressee company had, in the past, granted indemnity to Stork ICM in respect of workers' compensation claims made against it by former employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The letter advised of the proposed Scheme, and expressed Stork ICM's opinion that its right of indemnity was capable of being transferred to Stork FSA under the Scheme, so that, upon implementation of the Scheme Stork FSA would have the right of indemnity that Stork ICM currently enjoyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The letter concluded by inviting the addressee company to indicate if it would like to be informed of the date of the second court hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">None asked to be advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">55 Subsequently, Stork ICM's solicitors, McCullough Robertson, sent to the same four companies a form of 'Consent and Acknowledgment' and invited them to sign and return it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">By this document, an insurer consents to a transfer of all insurance policies which Stork ICM (described as being formerly 'World Services and Construction Pty Ltd') held or holds with the insurer, and all insurance policies which it held with other parties for which the insurer is now responsible, to Stork FSA in accordance with the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">56 The form of Consent and Acknowledgment contains a statement that, upon the Scheme being effective, Stork FSA will be entitled to all rights and benefits under the policies as if it was, and always had been, named as the insured in place of Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The document confirms, however, that the insurer's liability to Stork FSA will be no greater than its liability to Stork ICM would have been if the transfer under the Scheme had not taken place, and that any defences that would have been available against Stork ICM will be available against Stork FSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">57 Finally, the document contains an acknowledgment by the insurer that the validity of the policies is not affected by the transfer from Stork ICM to Stork FSA, or otherwise affected by the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">58 GIO and Allianz signed and returned the form of Consent and Acknowledgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">59 Zurich responded orally, through Ms Margaret Farag, to the effect that Zurich had no record of ever having been an insurer of Stork ICM (or World Services and Construction Proprietary Limited) and therefore did not intend to respond in writing to the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">60 CMS replied on 31 October 2006, confirming that the Authority had appointed it to administer claims arising from the policies issued by NEM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">61 Stork ICM's solicitors asked CMS to confirm that each decision whether to indemnify is primarily based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances of the person who is seeking damages from an insured, and whether that person had been employed in the relevant jurisdiction during the relevant period, rather than on an assessment of whether the particular insured (for example, Stork ICM) was entitled to indemnity from CMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">CMS's reply was: 'In determining whether to accept a claim under the IGF, [these] criteria ... are taken into account'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">CMS also pointed out, however, that it reserved the right to decline indemnity if, for example, a breach of a policy condition occurred, such as non-cooperation in the administration of a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">62 On 8 November 2006, CMS wrote a further letter to McCullough Robertson stating expressly that it would not, as a result of the transfer, deny Stork FSA any right to insurance, or payment pursuant to workers' compensation insurance, as would have been due to Stork ICM had the transfer not occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">COOK 
 
63 Pursuant to directions, Stork ICM notified Cook of the proceeding and provided it with background documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">On 23 November 2006, Cook's solicitors, Macpherson &amp; Kelley Lawyers, advised that their client did not seek to become a party to the proceeding and was content to abide by the orders of the Court.</sentence>

 Legislation 
 
64 Section 411(1) of the Act provides, relevantly, that where an arrangement is proposed between a Pt 5.1 body and its members or any class of them, the Court may order meetings of the members or class of members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Section 411(4) provides, relevantly, that an arrangement is binding on the members or class of members and on the Pt 5.1 body, if, at a meeting convened in accordance with the Court's order under s 411(1), the arrangement is agreed to by the members or class of members by a resolution in favour of it passed by a stipulated majority, and the arrangement is approved by an order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Section 411(6) provides that the Court may grant its approval to an arrangement subject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">65 Sections 413(1) and (2) of the Act provide, relevantly, as follows:
 
 '(1) Where an application is made to the Court under this Part for the approval of a compromise or arrangement and it is shown to the Court that the compromise or arrangement has been proposed for the purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the reconstruction of a Part 5.1 body or Part 5.1 bodies or the amalgamation of 2 or more Part 5.1 bodies and that, under the scheme, the whole or any part of the undertaking or of the property of a body concerned in the scheme (in this section called the transferor body ) is to be transferred to a company (in this section called the transferee company ), the Court may, either by the order approving the compromise or arrangement or by a later order, provide for all or any of the following matters: 
 
 
 (a) the transfer to the transferee company of the whole or a part of the undertaking and of the property or liabilities of the transferor body; ... 
 
 
 
 (2) Where an order made under this section provides for the transfer of property or liabilities, then, by virtue of the order, that property is transferred to and vests in, and those liabilities are transferred to and become the liabilities of, the transferee company, free, in the case of any particular property if the order so directs, from any charge that is, by virtue of the compromise or arrangement, to cease to have effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">' 
 

66 The definitions in s 413(4) assume some importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">That subsection is as follows:
 
 'In this section: 
 liabilities includes duties of any description, including duties that are of a personal character or are incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">
 property includes rights and powers of any description, including rights and powers that are of a personal character and are incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">' 
 

67 Several questions now arise:
 
 
 (1) For the purposes of s 411, is the Scheme properly to be regarded only as an arrangement between Stork ICM and its members, or does it also involve an arrangement between Stork ICM and its creditors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">(2) For the purposes of s 413, is the proposed arrangement one for the purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the 'reconstruction' of Stork ICM?</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">(3) Does s 413 authorise the making of an order that will have the effect of making Stork FSA, in place of Stork ICM, liable to the potential claimants?</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">(4) If, 'yes' to (3), does s 413 authorise the making of an order that will have the effect of vesting in Stork FSA, in place of Stork ICM, the contractual right to enforce a right of insurance indemnity in favour of Stork ICM in respect of such claims?</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">(5) Should the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, approve the Scheme, and, in particular, should the Court be satisfied that the potential claimants are adequately protected?</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">
 
 
 (1) For the purposes of s 411, is the Scheme properly to be regarded only as an arrangement between Stork ICM and its members, or does it also involve an arrangement between Stork ICM and its creditors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">

68 Stork International BV, the Stork NV subsidiary that intervenes between Stork NV and Stork ICM, can be put to one side: in substance, the Scheme involves a transfer of the whole of the property and liabilities of one wholly owned subsidiary of Stork NV to another wholly owned subsidiary of Stork NV, without any consideration passing from the latter to the former, and without any change in the shareholdings in the two companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">(Although I will be approving the Scheme subject to a minor alteration, I am addressing here the Scheme as proposed, and, in any event, it makes no difference that as a result of the alteration only 'virtually the whole of' Stork ICM's property and liabilities will be transferred at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">)
 
69 It is settled that in such circumstances, the Scheme is a members' scheme only: In re Sandwell Park Colliery Co Ltd [1914] 1 Ch 589; In re Star Tea Co Ltd [1930] WN 4; Re Clydesdale Bank Ltd [1950] SC 30; Re AGL Sydney Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 597; Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind Ltd v RBS.RVIB.VAF Ltd (2004) 206 ALR 581 (' RVIB '); SGIC Insurance Ltd v Insurance Australia Ltd (2004) 51 ACSR 470.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The position of creditors is appropriately addressed on the second court hearing as a consideration relevant to the discretion whether to approve the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">70 It is not necessary that Stork FSA be a party to the Scheme or propose a scheme, but it has been appropriately joined as a defendant: RVIB , esp at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">
 (2) For the purposes of s 413, is the proposed arrangement one for the purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the 'reconstruction' of Stork ICM?</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">

71 The arrangement is proposed for the purposes of, and in connection with, a scheme by which, generally speaking, one wholly owned subsidiary is to be denuded of its property and liabilities, which are to be vested in another wholly owned subsidiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">72 The expressions 'reconstruction' and 'amalgamation' were considered in In re South African Supply and Cold Storage Co [1904] 2 Ch 268 (' South African Supply ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In that case, the words occurred in the memoranda of association of two companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The questions before the Court related to the rights of preference shareholders and debenture stockholders on the winding up of the two companies, and the issue was whether, in each case, the winding up was 'for the purpose of reconstruction or amalgamation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">73 Buckley J observed that neither word had any definite legal meaning; that each was a commercial and not a legal term; and that even as a commercial term neither bore an exact definite meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">His Lordship said that it was necessary, in each case, to determine whether, in the minds of commercial people, the transaction was comprehended by the term 'reconstruction' or 'amalgamation' (at 281-2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I need not relate the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">His Lordship stated (at 286-7):
 
 'What does "reconstruction" mean?</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">To my mind it means this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">An undertaking of some definite kind is being carried on, and the conclusion is arrived at that it is not desirable to kill that undertaking, but that it is desirable to preserve it in some form, and to do so, not by selling it to an outsider who shall carry it on --- that would be a mere sale --- but in some altered form to continue the undertaking in such a manner as that the persons now carrying it on will substantially continue to carry it on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It involves, I think, that substantially the same business shall be carried on and substantially the same persons shall carry it on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">But it does not involve that all the assets shall pass to the new company or resuscitated company, or that all the shareholders of the old company shall be shareholders in the new company or resuscitated company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Substantially the business and the persons interested must be the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">... 
 
 Now what is an amalgamation?</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">An amalgamation involves, I think, a different idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">There you must have the rolling, somehow or other, of two concerns into one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">You must weld two things together and arrive at an amalgam --- a blending of two undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It does not necessarily follow that the whole of the two undertakings should pass --- substantially they must pass --- nor need all the corporators be parties, although substantially all must be parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The difference between reconstruction and amalgamation is that in the latter is involved the blending of two concerns one with the other, but not merely the continuance of one concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">An amalgamation may take place, it seems to me, either by the transfer of undertakings A and B to a new corporation, C, or by the continuance of A and B by B upon terms that the shareholders of A shall become shareholders in B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">It is not necessary that you should have a new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">You may have a continuance of one of the two companies upon the terms that the undertakings of both corporations shall substantially be merged in one corporation only.</sentence>

74 Buckley J's explanation of the meaning of 'reconstruction' was adopted by Pennycuick J in Brooklands Selangor Holdings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1970] 1 WLR 429 at 445, and by Plowman J in Baytrust Holdings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 1 WLR 1333 at 1352-3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Both of these cases concerned the construction of s 55 of the Finance Act 1927 (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">75 In Citizens and Graziers' Life Assurance Co Ltd v Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated) Assurances Ltd [1934] HCA 22 ; (1934) 51 CLR 422, the High Court had to consider whether particular circumstances constituted an 'amalgamation' of two companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Dixon J discussed the concept of the amalgamation of two companies at 457-8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">His Honour said:
 
 'The union of shareholders, which amalgamation involves, is, of course, not concerned with the members of the combining corporations as persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It is the reorganization of share capital that matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The replacement of two separate systems of share capital by one appears to be required before a union of two companies limited by shares can justly be called an amalgamation of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In the process of reorganization, classes or divisions of shares, or amount of share capital, in one or other or both of the old companies may find no representation in the one system of capital which emerges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">But the substantial result must be to reduce for practical purposes two or more organizations of capital to one, and two or more incorporated companies to one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The amalgamation to which the clause in the memorandum refers is not a mere combination of businesses separately conducted, but an amalgamation of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">There is no context to enlarge the meaning of the expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">To accomplish such an amalgamation, it seems necessary, either to consolidate the constituent elements of the old companies into a new one, or to merge in one of the old companies the constituent elements of the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Possibly a transaction may be an amalgamation although the corporate existence of the consolidating companies, or of the merged company, may be continued for some special and definite purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">But the continuance of two corporations under separate control, organized with their separate systems of share capital and capable of independent activities, appears to me inconsistent with an amalgamation of more than their existing enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">' 
 

76 I agree with Mr Oakes that a restrictive interpretation should not be placed on either the term 'reconstruction' or the term 'amalgamation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">I also accept his submission that the approach should be simply to inquire whether the circumstances of a particular case fall within one or the other or both of the words, without first attempting to delineate their respective boundaries of meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">77 In my view, the arrangement as proposed is a reconstruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The whole of the undertaking, property and liabilities of Stork ICM is to be transferred to and vest in Stork FSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">These circumstances fall within Buckley J's description of a 'reconstruction' in South African Supply .</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Although the run off activity of Stork ICM can hardly be called the 'carrying on' of an undertaking, that business-related activity will be taken over by Stork FSA, and will continue to be, indirectly, an activity of the parent company, Stork NV, as it is at present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">It will, however, be an activity distinct from the trading activity of Stork FSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Stork FSA will receive particulars of claims made by the potential claimants, and will deal with insurers and CMS in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">That is to say, Stork FSA will continue to do what Stork ICM does now, but its activity in this respect will not form part of its trading activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">78 To my mind, the word 'amalgamation' does not so easily lend itself to the proposed arrangement, because there will be no 'blending' of the two activities, even though they will both be carried on by Stork FSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">
 (3) Does s 413 authorise the making of an order that will have the effect of making Stork FSA, in place of Stork ICM, liable to the potential claimants?</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">

79 Section 413 of the Act has its genesis in s 54 of the Companies Act 1928 (UK) which did not come into force, although the provision later appeared as s 154 of the Companies Act 1929 (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The present English provision is s 427 of the Companies Act 1985 (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">80 The genesis of the English provision is paras 81---85 of the Report of the Company Law Amendment Committee (1925-26) (HMSO Cmnd 2657, 1926) produced by a Committee chaired by Mr Wilfrid Greene KC, but the comments there do not assist in relation to any issue before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">81 The following table indicates the history of the provision in New South Wales and Commonwealth legislation:
 Legislation Section Number Companies Act 1936 (NSW) Section 134 Companies Act 1961 (NSW) Section 183 Companies (New South Wales) Code (NSW) Section 317 Corporations Law (Cth) Section 413 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) Section 413 

 
82 In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Limited [1940] AC 1014 (' Nokes ') it was held that the provision applied only to rights and liabilities that were capable of being assigned under the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">ASIC raised for my consideration the question whether the 'no assignment without consent' provision meant that Stork ICM's right of insurance indemnity could not be transferred under s 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">I discuss this question later, but since Nokes applies to 'liabilities' as well as to 'property', it is convenient to discuss the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">83 In Nokes , approval of a scheme of amalgamation was granted under s 153 of the Companies Act 1929 (UK) and an order was made under s 154 for the transfer of all the property and liabilities of the companies that were being amalgamated to a new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The issue was whether a contract of service between an employee and a 'transferor' company became, by the operation of the order, a contract of service between the employee and the 'transferee' company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">By majority, the House of Lords held that it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Section 154(1) of that Act was, relevantly, similar to s 413(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">However, the definitions of 'property' and 'liabilities' in subs (4) of the English s 154 were different from the definitions of those expressions now found in subs (4) of the Australian s 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Subsection (4) of the English s 154 provided:
 
 'In this section the expression "property" includes property, rights and powers of every description, and the expression "liabilities" includes duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">' 
 

Subsection (4) of the Australian s 413 was set out at [66] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">84 The facts in Nokes were that after the making of the order, Mr Nokes absented himself from work in circumstances that would have made him liable under s 4 of the Employers and Workmen Act 1875 (UK) if he could be regarded as employed under a contract of service with the transferee company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In holding that he could not be, the majority of the House of Lords held that s 154(1) applied only to rights and liabilities that were capable of being assigned under the general law, and that the mutual contractual obligations of employer and employee were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">A contract of service can not be bought or sold or given away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Under the general law, a new contract of service would have had to be entered into with the new employer, and s 154 did not overcome that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Lord Romer dissented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">85 In Re "L" Hotel Co Ltd &amp; Langham Hotel Co Ltd [1946] 1 All ER 319, Uthwatt J said (at 320) that he saw the principle of Nokes as limiting the statutory provision to 'only such property as could be transferred by an act inter partes '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">86 While s 134(4) of the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) and s 183(5) of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW) both defined 'property' and 'liabilities' in terms in substance indistinguishable from those of the English s 154(4), new expanded definitions of those terms were introduced into the Australian legislation in 1981 as part of s 317 of the Companies Code , and they have remained unchanged since (see [66] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">They make it clear that 'duties that are of a personal character or are incapable under the general law of being performed vicariously' are included in the notion of 'liabilities', and that 'rights and powers that are of a personal character and are incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously' are included in the notion of 'property'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The researches of counsel have not discovered the reason for the expansion of the definitions, but it may have been to overcome the holding in Nokes .</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">87 The Scheme provides in cl 4 for Stork ICM's property and liabilities to be transferred to, and to be vested in or become the property and liabilities of, Stork FSA, without the need for any further act or deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Clause 1.1 defines 'liabilities' to mean:
 
 'all liabilities however arising and whether present, unascertained, immediate, future or contingent, including any "liabilities" (within the meaning in subsection 413(4) of the Corporations Act ) and any Future Proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">' 
 

The expression 'Future Proceedings' is defined in cl 1.1 of the Scheme to mean:
 
 'legal proceedings which have not commenced, but for which the cause of action has accrued or the events that lead to a cause of action accruing have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">' 
 

However, it was agreed that in any order to be made, this definition should be varied in the interests of the potential claimants so as to read:
 
 'legal proceedings which have not commenced, but for which the cause of action has accrued or the injury or other event that may lead to a cause of action accruing (including, without limitation, exposure to asbestos dust) has occurred, or will occur in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">' 
 

88 Stork ICM's liability to potential claimants is not a 'duty' within s 413(4) 's inclusory definition of 'liabilities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">However, in my opinion, it falls within the word 'liabilities' in s 413(4) according to the ordinary meaning of the term in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">89 In Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59 ; (1999) 200 CLR 1, the High Court held unanimously that the word 'liabilities' in s 14 of the Stevedoring Industry Acts (Termination) Act 1977 (Cth), which provided for a vesting in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee of liabilities of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, operated to vest in the Committee the liability of the Authority in respect of a breach of its duty of care to safeguard wharf labourers against exposure to asbestos fibres, even though the injury was suffered after the vesting under s 14 took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Gleeson CJ observed that depending on the context, 'liability' can include contingent or potential liability (his Honour cited Walters v Babergh District Council (1983) 82 LGR (Eng) 235 (QBD)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The Chief Justice noted (at 14) that the legislation abolished the Authority which no longer had the capacity to meet any claims upon it, and said that there was no good reason to distinguish between complete and inchoate causes of action, where the Authority had committed a breach of a legal duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">90 The other members of the Court also read the word 'liabilities' in s 14 expansively, rather than narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">91 That the word 'liabilities' in s 413 should also receive an expansive interpretation is indicated by the purpose of the section of facilitating the transfer of undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">92 In my opinion the inchoate, potential or contingent liabilities of Stork ICM to the potential claimants, are capable of being made the subject of an order under s 413(1), and therefore of becoming inchoate, potential or contingent liabilities of Stork FSA instead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">
 (4) If 'yes' to (3), does s 413 authorise the making of an order that will have the effect of vesting in Stork FSA, in place of Stork ICM, the contractual right to enforce a right of insurance indemnity in favour of Stork ICM in respect of such claims?</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">

93 The 'property' in question is Stork ICM's contractual right to require insurers to indemnify Stork ICM under insurance arrangements, in respect of sums for which Stork ICM is or may become liable to pay, as workers' compensation or damages at common law, to the potential claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">If the insurer should fail to indemnity Stork ICM, the remedy to which Stork ICM would be entitled is a monetary one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">94 As noted above, the Scheme provides for all property of Stork ICM to be transferred to and to be vested in Stork FSA, without the need for any further act or deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The word 'property' is defined in cl 1.1 of the Scheme to mean:
 
 'any legal or equitable estate or interest (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent) in real or personal property of any description, including a thing in action, any "property" (within the meaning in subsection 413(4) of the Corporations Act ) and any other thing capable of being transferred by order of the Court in accordance with paragraph 413(1)(a) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">' 
 

It suffices to say that Stork ICM's contractual right of indemnity is a 'thing in action'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">95 I do not think the right of indemnity is a 'right of a personal character and ... incapable under the general law of being assigned or performed vicariously' within s 413(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">In my view, however, it is 'property' according to the ordinary meaning of that term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">96 Two distinct issues arose as to whether the Court could make an order which would have the effect of assigning Stork ICM's right of insurance indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The first issue concerned the 'no assignment without consent' provision (set out at [48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The second issue related to the question whether the order would change the content of the insurer's obligation as a result of substituting one insured (Stork FSA) for another (Stork ICM).</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">97 Although I need not resolve these issues in view of the new course the proceeding took (see below), I express the opinion that neither issue raises a problem for the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">98 In relation to the 'no assignment of interest without consent' provision, my view is that that provision applies only to assignments by an act of the insured, and has nothing to say to a transfer effected by an order of the Court under s 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The provision contemplates an assignment by the holder of the interest under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Sections 413(1) and (2), on the other hand, contemplate a court order 'providing for' a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">It is the operation of s 413(2) on the order, if and when made, that causes the transfer of the property and liabilities, without any involvement of Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Neither Stork ICM nor the Court 'transfers' the property or liabilities of Stork ICM for the purposes of the policy provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Stork ICM's application for the order does not effect the transfer, and, in case it matters, strictly the Court's order that provides for the transfer does not do so either: it is the operation of s 413(2) upon such an order that does so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">99 Support for the view expressed in the preceding paragraph is found in a line of authority concerning contractual promises not to assign real or personal property without consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">It is held that such promises do not extend to assignments effected by operation of law upon the making of an order of the court following an adjudication, even if it was the person who promised not to assign who applied for the order: In re Riggs; ex parte Lovell [1901] 2 KB 16; Marsh v Gilbert [1980] 2 EGLR 44; In re Landau (a Bankrupt) [1998] Ch 223; Krasner v Dennison [2001] Ch 76.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">100 The second issue to which I referred, can best be considered by reference to Housing Guarantee Fund Ltd v Yusef [1991] 2 VR 17 (' HGFL v Yusef ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">101 In HGFL v Yusef , Yusef and Beaton formed a building construction company ('the company').</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Registration of the company with the Master Builders Housing Fund Ltd ('MBHFL') was conditional upon provision to MBHFL of personal guarantees by Yusef and Beaton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The company was also required to be bound by the rules of MBHFL as in force or amended from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Deeds of guarantee and indemnity were executed and delivered by which Yusef and Beaton guaranteed to MBHFL all moneys which the company might become liable to pay to MBHFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">102 As a result of the approval of a scheme under s 317 of the Companies (Victoria) Code , the property, undertakings, liabilities, obligations and duties of MBHFL were transferred to and vested in Housing Guarantee Fund Ltd ('HGFL').</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">The company applied for, and was granted, recognition by HGFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">HGFL requested Beaton and his wife (who had also become a director of the company) and Yusef to provide guarantees to HGFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Mr and Mrs Beaton did so, but Yusef declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">In fact, he resigned as a director of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">103 The company contracted to erect a dwelling house for clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The work fell behind schedule and the work completed was defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The company went into a creditors' voluntary liquidation, the building contract was terminated, and the clients gave notice of complaint to HGFL, which settled their claim on terms, the reasonableness of which was not in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">HGFL claimed indemnification from Mr and Mrs Beaton under an indemnity arising from the guarantees they had given to HGFL after the amalgamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">HGFL's claim against Yusef, however, rested on the guarantee and indemnity he had earlier given to MBHFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">104 Yusef succeeded before the primary Judge, Marks J. MBHFL appealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">105 The indemnity in favour of MBHFL arose from its rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Rule 6.6 provided that the company should bind itself in the terms of Sch 2 to the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Schedule 2 made it clear that the indemnified liability was a liability of MBHFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">It was not questioned that MBHFL's rights under Yusef's guarantee might be assigned or transferred, but, as Crockett J observed (at 21):
 
 'it is altogether another matter to say, as the appellant does, that the scheme of arrangement operated so as to cause the guarantee to serve as a security for the company's liabilities that were never those of MBHFL .</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">'
 

His Honour accepted Yusef's submission that the scheme of arrangement and the provisions of s 317 did no more than transfer to HGFL the rights which MBHFL had, and did not change the content of those rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Yusef did not become guarantor in respect of new liabilities of HGFL that arose pursuant to HGFL's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">His Honour said (at 21):
 
 'Were he [Yusef] to become such a guarantor he would be providing [HGFL] with a guarantee not only to a different person but in respect of the company's indebtedness arising pursuant to a completely different contract entered into with and more favourable to [HGFL].</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">'
 

106 The other members of the Court, Murphy and Cummins JJ, in independent judgments, generally agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">107 HGFL v Yusef is distinguishable from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In HGFL v Yusef , the circumstances that gave rise to the liability occurred after the Court order was made, whereas in the present case, all those circumstances have already occurred, even though they have not yet crystallised in the form of a notified claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">108 The point is that the transfer in HGFL v Yusef had the potential to impose on Yusef a liability to HGFL in respect of circumstances in relation to which he was not liable to MBHFL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">In contrast, Stork ICM is in run off, and the policies do not apply to an ongoing business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">It must be immaterial to an insurer whether Stork FSA or Stork ICM refers on to it claims brought by the potential claimants in respect of circumstances, all of which occurred prior to the sale of Stork ICM's business in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">109 The substitution of a different entity as the insured is itself immaterial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In HGFL v Yusef it was not questioned that MBHFL's rights under Yusef's guarantee might be transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">In the present case, the very 'no assignment without consent' provision itself shows that it was contemplated that a different entity might become the insured as the result of a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">110 In the result, Stork ICM's contractual right of indemnity is capable of being made the subject of an order under s 413, and therefore of benefiting Stork FSA in place of Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">
 (5) Should the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, approve the Scheme, and, in particular, should the Court be satisfied that the potential claimants are adequately protected?</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">

111 I indicated to the parties in the course of the hearing my view:
 
&#8226; that I should not make the orders sought unless I was clearly satisfied that the potential claimants would be no worse off if the order were made than they would be otherwise;
 
&#8226; that I would not rely on the financial position of Stork FSA, the Stork ICM Deed of Indemnity and the Deed Poll, the Stork FSA Deed of Indemnity, or the letters of comfort; and 
 
&#8226; that the one and only real protection that the potential claimants have is to be found in the insurances held by Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">112 I raised with the parties three questions that had been concerning me:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Can Stork NV obtain the benefit of the tax deduction under the tax law of the Netherlands only if Stork ICM is deregistered without winding up?</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">If so, can Stork ICM be deregistered without winding up, without first being denuded of all of its property and liabilities?</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">If so, can the desired result be achieved by an order under s 413, limited so as to exclude from the transfer: 

&#8226; the benefit of an insurance policy where the insurer has not consented to the transfer; and
 
&#8226; the liability of Stork ICM to potential claimants to which such a policy responds?</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">I now turn to these three questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Can Stork NV obtain the benefit of a tax deduction under the law of the Netherlands only if Stork ICM is deregistered without winding up?</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">

113 The plaintiff filed and read an affidavit of Willem Henk Peters sworn 21 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr Peters is a director of Stork ICM, having held that position since 26 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">He is also a tax director of Stork NV, having held that position since 1 November 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">His affidavit shows that Stork NV and Stork International BV form part of a tax consolidated group in the Netherlands for the purpose of the Corporate Income Tax Act of the Netherlands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Mr Peters states that tax is levied on Stork NV as if Stork International BV has been dissolved into Stork NV, and, accordingly, all profits and losses of Stork International BV are treated as those of Stork NV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">114 Mr Peters states that, if Stork ICM is deregistered, then Stork NV, as the ultimate holding company of Stork ICM, will be entitled, under the Netherlands tax law, to obtain a tax benefit equal to the difference between the historical cost price of Stork ICM in the tax books of its direct shareholder, Stork International BV, and the net asset position of Stork ICM at the time of deregistration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">If Stork ICM was deregistered on or before 31 December 2006, Stork NV would be entitled, for tax purposes, to deduct an amount from its profits for the year ending 31 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The deductible amount is calculated in a manner explained in Mr Peters's affidavit, and the applicable tax rate for the year 2006 is 29.6 percent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Mr Peters further explains that if Stork ICM was to be deregistered after 31 December 2006, but on or before 31 December 2007, then the deductible amount would be 'basically the same amount' plus or minus the movement in the net asset position of Stork ICM in the year 2007, but the applicable tax rate for 2007 would be 25.5 percent, which would reduce the tax advantage to Stork NV substantially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">115 Annexed to Mr Peters's affidavit is an extract of Art 13d of the Corporate Income Tax Act of the Netherlands and a translation of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The English translation uses the word 'liquidation' and its derivatives, but I am assured that deregistration is regarded as satisfying that word.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">I accept that deregistration or liquidation of Stork ICM is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Can Stork ICM be deregistered without winding up, without first being denuded of all of its property and liabilities?</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">

116 There are three ways in which a company may be deregistered: voluntarily as the result of the lodgement with ASIC of an application to deregister under s 601AA of the Act; as a result of a decision by ASIC to deregister the company under s 601AB of the Act; or pursuant to an order of the Court under ss 413(1)(d), 481(5)(b) or 509(6) of the Act (see s 601AC of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Sections 481(5)(d) and 509(6) are not relevant to this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">117 In the case of voluntary deregistration, the company's assets must be worth less than $1,000 and the company must have no outstanding liabilities: s 601AA(2)(c) and (e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">There is no comparable constraint in the case of a deregistration initiated by ASIC under s 601AB or upon the making of an order under s 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">I agree with Mr Whitford SC that s 413(1)(a) and (d), in combination, seem to contemplate the making of an order providing for a transfer of only part of the property or liabilities of a company, yet for the deregistration of it by ASIC without winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Moreover, s 601AD points to such a construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Subsection (1) of s 601AD provides that a company ceases to exist on deregistration, and subs (2) provides that, on deregistration, all of the company's property vests in ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">That is to say, the fact that a company has property does not make deregistration of the company impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">118 It is plain that it is no obstacle to the making of an order under s 413 for the deregistration of Stork ICM that the order will transfer to Stork FSA something less than the whole of the property and liabilities of Stork ICM, by, for example, excluding from the transfer the benefit of an insurance policy where the insurer has not consented to the transfer, and the liability of Stork ICM to potential claimants to which such a policy responds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Can the desired result be achieved by an order under s 413, limited so as to exclude: 

&#8226; the benefit of an insurance policy where the insurer has not consented to the transfer, and; 
 
&#8226; the liability of Stork ICM to potential claimants to which such a policy responds?</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">
 
119 Senior counsel for Stork ICM took instructions in relation to this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The answer given was 'yes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Ms McCallum SC saw no disadvantage from the viewpoint of the potential claimants if the matter were to proceed to finality with a variation to the Scheme under s 411(6) accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">120 It seems to me that there should be excepted from the general transfer:
 
 &#8226; Stork ICM's right of indemnity, if any, against Zurich and against any other insurer that has not consented to an assignment under the Scheme of Stork ICM's interest under any insurance policy that responds to any liability of Stork ICM to potential claimants ('Excepted Policy'): and
 &#8226; any liability of Stork ICM to potential claimants to which an Excepted Policy responds ('Excepted Liability').</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">

121 I am proposing that an Excepted Policy will not be transferred to, or vest in, Stork FSA, and an Excepted Liability will not be transferred to and become a liability of Stork FSA, unless and until the Court makes a further order to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">In this respect, there will be liberty to Stork ICM and to Stork FSA to apply
 
122 In substance, Cook, GIO and Allianz have consented to a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">So, in substance, has CMS, in that it will not count against Stork FSA (in relation to payment out of the IGF) the fact of the transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The only insurer that, on the evidence, has not consented, is Zurich, which maintains that it never did insure Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">123 If a claimant should wish to sue Stork ICM, and it is contended, for example, that Zurich was the insurer at the relevant time, the claimant will be entitled to apply under s 601AH(2) of the Act for the Court to order that ASIC reinstate the registration of Stork ICM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The Court would make such an order if it was satisfied that it was just to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">It is true that a claimant in such a case would suffer the disadvantage of having to make such an application, but it seems to me that the likelihood of this eventuating is small, and that it would be very likely indeed that the order would be made, and probably on the basis that Stork FSA or Stork NV or, perhaps after its reinstatement, Stork ICM, pay the potential claimants' costs of the application since its purpose would be to allow the dispute as to the identity of Stork ICM's insurer at the relevant time to be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">(I agree, incidentally, with senior counsel for ASIC, that s 601AG would be of doubtful utility, because that section would operate only in a case where the facts showed that Stork ICM had a liability to the claimant immediately before the deregistration; see Orica Ltd v CGU Insurance Ltd [2003] NSWCA 331 ; (2003) 59 NSWLR 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">)
 CONCLUSION 
 
124 Subject to an amendment in the definition of 'Future Proceedings' in the Scheme, the Scheme should be approved, with an alteration so as to exclude, pending any further order under s 413, any Excepted Liability, and any right of indemnity under an Excepted Policy, in each case as described above.</sentence>
