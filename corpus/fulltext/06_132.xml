1 The Court heard Ms Mackay's application under s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) at the same time as the application in Bell v Minister for Health [2006] FCA 134.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">These reasons for judgment are to be read together with the reasons for judgment in Bell , delivered this day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Ms Mackay also claimed that her employer breached cl 26 of the Health and Disability Services --- Support Workers - Western Australian Government - Award 2001 in respect of her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 Ms Mackay's case differs from that of Ms Bell in the following respects:
 
 &#8226; she became a full time employee under the Award on 5 November 2001 in a non-relieving position;
 &#8226; from 5 November 2001 until the date of the filing of the application she worked regular fixed hours, in circumstances where she was fully aware of the days on which she was rostered off work in any given week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Those days only changed when management altered her work location in mid 2002 and again in May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">At each location the hours and days worked by her were fixed; and
 &#8226; her work was not subject to a formal written roster because there was no need for such a roster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">All employees in those locations who were not relieving knew when they were to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">

4 Clause 26.7 of the award must be read sensibly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It requires the display of a roster for full time employees which sets out their start and finishing times and their rostered days off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">If a person is told, whilst employed at a particular location that her or his start and finishing times and rostered days off are fixed there is no need for a formal written roster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The requirement to display rosters which contain the abvovementioned information is only operative when employees work in accordance with a roster which does not contain fixed working hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Any other construction of cl 26.7 of the award would be unworkable impose an unnecessary administrative burden on an employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 For the above reasons and the reasons set out in Bell as to the proper construction of cl 26 of the award, the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Associate:
