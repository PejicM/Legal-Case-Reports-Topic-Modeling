1 This is an appeal from the judgment of the Industrial Magistrate's Court ('the IM Court') on 28 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">By the orders the IM Court imposed a penalty of $6000 on the first appellant ('the Union'), $1500 on the second appellant ('Mr Powell') and $1000 on the third appellant ('Mr Molina').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondent to the appeal ('Mr Clarke') is an inspector appointed pursuant to s 84 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') who brought the action against the appellants.</sentence>

<sentence id="s7">THE WORKPLACE SETTING 
 
3 The employer concerned in the relevant events was Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd ('the Employer').</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was engaged relevantly in concrete, structural and bridge work on the Thornlie Railway Station and bridges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">THE CERTIFIED AGREEMENT 
 
4 For the purposes of that work the Employer entered into a certified agreement ('the Agreement') with the Union pursuant to s 170LL of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It was certified in accordance with s 170LT of the Act coming into operation on 26 May 2004 and remained in force until 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 The parties bound by the Agreement were the Employer, the 'employees of the [Employer] who are engaged on the Thornlie Rail Extension Structural Work Project ['the Project'], in the classifications detailed in section 3' of the Agreement ('the Employees') and the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Agreement was stated to have exclusive operation and to be in full and final settlement of all claims during the period of its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 Clause 4.5 of the Agreement dealt with 'Dispute Resolution Procedures.</sentence>

 7 Relevantly, provision was also made in cl 7.3 for 'Job Representatives'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The clause reads:
 
 'The Company supports the continuing role for the job representative when requested by an employee in handling of questions, disputes or difficulties in accordance with subsection 4.5 Grievance Resolution Procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 Any employee elected to the position of job representative shall be recognised as such by the Company and will have reasonable work time, when mutually convenient, to undertake matters related to employees of the Company, when so required by those employees, in accordance with the procedure outlined in subsection 4.5 of this Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 The Company shall ensure that the Job representative is provided with adequate resources to perform their representative role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 

8 There were three clauses of the Agreement which at the relevant time were the subject of dispute between the Employer and the Employees ('the Issues').</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The first related to cl 2.10 which addressed the issue of redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This clause generally provided for the payment of $60 per week ($65 with effect from 1 December 2004) where the redundancy was occasioned otherwise than by the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Employees wanted the redundancy provision payable to those Employees who left of their own accord and they wanted redundancy contributions for all Employees to be paid into the Western Australian Construction Industry Redundancy Fund Ltd. 
 
9 The second cause of dissension was cl 6.5 which contained provisions applicable in respect of inclement weather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Employees wanted these varied to be the same as the inclement weather conditions provided for in cl 21 of the National Building and Construction Industry Award 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 The third clause which was the subject of contention was cl 3.7 which addressed the special project allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Clause 3.7 provided for an allowance of $110 per week as follows:
 
 'Notwithstanding that the site allowance provided for by this Agreement covers all general disabilities and special circumstances arising from construction activities on site, an amount of $110.00 per week worked will be paid as a Special Project Allowance provided, however.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Pro rata entitlements will be calculated as detailed below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">' 
 

The clause goes on to provide:
 
 'For the purposes of pro-rata entitlements, the allowance applicable shall be calculated at the rate of $22.00 per day, Monday to Friday inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 

11 In respect of the special project allowance, it was the Employees' position that they should be paid an extra $22 for their work on Saturday, which was a normal working day and the same amount if required to work on a Sunday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">THE UNION 
 
12 Also of relevance are the registered rules of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Rule 2(A)(A) deals with the Constitution of the Union and provides that it shall consist of an unlimited number of persons whether male or female:

<sentence id="s58">They receive proper credentials from the Divisional Branch Management Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is their duty to endeavour to enrol appropriate workers in their respective shops or jobs into the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">18 Rule 58 provides that should any shop or job steward (among others) be victimised or reasonably supposed to be victimised for carrying out any duties of the Union, the Divisional Branch Management Committee shall take all necessary steps to see that that person's interests are protected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">THE CHARGE 
 
19 The amended statement of claim which supported the charge of failure to comply with the Agreement and consequent contravention of s 170MN of the Act alleged as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It stated that the Employees had gone on strike on three occasions, namely, 9-11 July 2004 (inclusive); 29 July 2004; and 19-20 August 2004 (inclusive).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It claimed that their conduct was 'industrial action' within the meaning of that expression in s 4 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">20 The charge alleged that the Union engaged in the industrial action because it was directly or indirectly a party to or concerned in that conduct by reason of the following conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">First, representatives or agents of the Union (including Messrs Powell and Molina) attended meetings of the Employees on 9 July 2004, 29 July 2004 and 19 August 2004 as a consequence of which meetings the Employees commenced the industrial action the subject of the charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Additionally, two representatives or agents of the Union had attended meetings on 13 July 2004, reporting back on the industrial action and on 13 August 2004, meeting with the Employees on the site of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The second category of conduct was that representatives or agents of the Union (being Messrs Powell and Molina) conveyed information and claims relating to the industrial action to representatives of the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">This is said to have occurred on 9 July 2004, 26 July 2004, 29 July 2004 and 19 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The third category of conduct was that on 9 July 2004 Mr Powell threatened that he would 'take the boys out' when speaking to the Project Manager for the work employed by the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It was claimed that the threat was intended to mean that the Employees would take industrial action by striking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">21 It was pleaded in the amended statement of claim that each of these categories of conduct breached the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Further, it was pleaded that the conduct of the Union breached cl 4.5 of the Agreement in that it did not follow the dispute resolution procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In relation to the industrial action on 29 July 2004, it was said that it was taken during the term of the Agreement and for the purpose of supporting and advancing claims against the Employer in respect of the Employees and had been engaged in by each of the appellants in contravention of s 170MN of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS 
 
22 Section 4(8) of the Act provides:
 
 '(8) In this Act, a reference to engaging in conduct includes a reference to being, whether directly or indirectly, a party to or concerned in the conduct.</sentence>

23 Relevantly s 170MN provides:
 
 '(1) From the time when: 
 (a) a certified agreement; or

 (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the following are covered by this subsection: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) any employee whose employment is subject to the agreement or award; 
 (b) an organisation of employees that is bound by the agreement or award; 
 (c) an officer or employee of such an organisation acting in that capacity.</sentence>

 (3) If the employee, organisation or officer contravenes subsection (1), the action concerned is not protected action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 
 (4) ...'

 &#8226; Mr TR Kucera, legal officer for the Union, who stated that he took his instructions from Mr Reynolds, the Secretary of the Union and additionally from time to time acted for individual members in relation to matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 INDUSTRIAL MAGISTRATE'S REASONS AND FINDINGS 
 
27 After referring to the nature of the claim, relevant portions of the Agreement and issues which had been concerning the Employees in relation to the Agreement, his Honour found that it was not in issue that the Employees who were the subject of the Agreement took industrial action by going on strike and leaving the site (of the Project) on 9 July 2004, 29 July 2004 and on 19-20 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">CLAIMANTS' CASE 
 
28 His Honour said that the claimant's case was that preceding each decision by the Employees to withdraw their labour a meeting had been arranged and organised by the shop steward, Mr Levy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">All these meetings had been attended by Mr Powell who was accompanied by Mr Buchan (an employed organiser of the Union), Mr Molina and also Mr McDonald (one of the Union's assistant secretaries).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Each meeting had been attended by Mr Levy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">29 His Honour described the evidence of Mr Radalj, the civil engineer and project manager, in the following terms:
 
 'Radalj gave evidence of the attendance on site of Powell and Buchan on the morning of 9 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He said Powell told him he was there to investigate the incident on 8 July 2004 where a truck dumping fill in area B had its tray tip over onto its side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Radalj described Powell as becoming hot-headed after Radalj had queried Powell's right to enter the site without giving notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">He said Powell had told him to "... off " and that " he would come on site when I want to when it's to do with the boys' safety ' and when told that there had already been an investigation into the truck incident Powell said he would do his own investigation and stormed out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 Radalj said he was aware of a meeting of basically the entire workforce and Powell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The meeting lasted fifteen to twenty minutes and after it finished Powell came back to the office and said the boys are withdrawing their labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">When asked why, Radalj said Powell told him it was because management had failed to consult about the incident with the truck, the facilities in area D were not up to standard, toilets were not cleaned and there was no first aid box in area D. It was Radalj's view that the issues were of a minor nature and could have been readily resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">
 
 Relevant to the incident on 29 July 2004 Radalj gave evidence that Powell and Molina came to the site and had a meeting with the workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">After the meeting Powell and Molina attended at the site office and raised with Radalj the issues of the $22.00 per day allowance and the redundancy payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">On that day the workforce left the site after the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 The evidence of Radalj about what took place on 19 August 2004 was that Powell came to the site about 10.00am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He said: 
 
 
 
 "A meeting was held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The meeting was later transferred outside the gates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">On the conclusion of the meeting Mr Powell came in and spoke to me and basically said that the workforce is out on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I'm not sure if it was one, two or three days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He identified the reasons why they were going on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">... One of them was that I was that I was hassling people on how to do their job; that I was taking money away from people by saying when they can and cannot work; that I was allowing work to proceed in an unsafe area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I'm pretty sure inclement weather was raised again --- about when people can go home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">"
 
 
 
 On all three occasions the workforce went on strike the entire workforce left the site and it is the evidence of Radalj that they did so without the dispute resolution procedures being applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">' 

30 His Honour then said that it was not his intention to refer in detail to the evidence of the other prosecution (now respondent) witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He said in relation to that evidence:
 
 'Generally the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the issues in dispute centred on the special project allowance, redundancy and inclement weather clauses of the agreement and supports the prosecution claim that the dispute resolution procedures were not followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' 
 APPELLANTS' CASE 
 
31 His Honour described the appellants' case as being that they had done nothing to encourage the workforce to withdraw their labour but, on the contrary, tried to prevent the strike and direct the workforce towards the dispute resolution procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">32 He described the evidence of Mr Powell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In relation to 9 July 2004, his evidence was that he had told the meeting that the dispute resolution procedures should be followed; they should remain on the site (of the Project) while the dispute resolution procedures were gone through.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Nevertheless the workforce had voted to go on strike for the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">33 In relation to 29 July 2004, Mr Powell's evidence was that he had told the employees that there was an Agreement in place and the conditions of that Agreement had to be worn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">34 In relation to 19 August 2004, Mr Powell's evidence was he had attended the meeting at the request of the shop steward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He testified that he had told the meeting of the need to follow the dispute resolution procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">35 His Honour said that Mr Aleknavicius had given evidence that on 9 July 2004 Mr Powell had told the Employees that it was in their best interest to stay at work because it was a safety issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">36 In relation to 29 July 2004, Mr Powell had told the meeting that he still wanted to try and negotiate with the Employer at that stage and he believed that if they had time they could negotiate a bit more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However, the Employees voted to go on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">37 The evidence of Mr Molina was referred to in relation to the evidence Mr Levy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It was said by his Honour that his evidence generally supported the appellants' position that the workers withdrew their labour of their own volition, notwithstanding being advised of the Agreement and Mr Powell's advice to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Mr Levy also gave evidence that it was he who arranged for the Union officials to attend the site (of the Project) each time and was instrumental in gathering the Employees for the meetings, including collecting them from site areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">INDUSTRIAL MAGISTRATE'S REASONING 
 
38 His Honour said the issue in the proceedings was not whether there had been a breach of the Agreement, but whether the breaches were by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">39 He found that the issues of concern to the Employees and the Union and its hierarchy and officers were the three issues of special project allowance, the redundancy provision and the inclement weather clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">These had become a concern soon after the Agreement had been certified on 26 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">He understood the evidence to be that all workers on the site were aware of the Agreement before accepting employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">40 His Honour then found that on any construction of the Agreement the action of the workers on the three occasions they withdrew their labour and left the site was in breach of the provisions of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He found the evidence did not support any claims that the industrial action was based on a reasonable concern by the Employees about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety as provided for in s 4 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He therefore concluded they had withdrawn their labour in pursuance of their claim in relation to the three issues identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">41 In relation to the claim by the appellants that they played no part in the industrial action taken by the Employees, his Honour considered that claim could not be substantiated on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In his view there was an irresistible inference that the Union by its officers played a significant part in the activities which led to the withdrawal of labour and in turn the breach of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">42 He also found that there was no evidence of any bona fide attempt by the Union to follow the dispute resolution procedures of cl 4.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">43 Referring to s 170MN of the Act, his Honour said that all three appellants were covered by the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He found that the industrial action was for the purpose of supporting and advancing claims against the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">44 His Honour then referred to s 4(8) of the Act and continued:
 
 'In this case the union by its officers including its organisers and site steward called, arranged and attended the three meetings which resulted in the withdrawal of labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">They had direct involvement in the industrial action and, in my view, at least with the knowledge of the outcome of the meeting on 9 July 2004, it was foreseeable that a similar outcome was likely following the next two meetings as the three issues had still not been resolved and the union had not engaged in the steps provided for in the dispute resolution procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 I find therefore the Respondents did engage in industrial action for the purpose of supporting and advancing claims against the employer herein as claimed and the Respondents are in breach of section 170MN of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">' 
 GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
45 There are 22 grounds of appeal referred to in the notice of appeal, many containing a number of sub-grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">At the request of the Court the appellants have grouped these grounds and it is proposed to address the grounds of appeal in accordance with that grouping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">WHETHER CONDUCT OF UNION MEMBERS IS CONDUCT OF APPELLANTS: GROUNDS 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 21 
 
46 These grounds are directed to the correctness of the conclusion of his Honour finding that the appellants were liable for contravening s 170MN of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">They are directed specifically in the conclusion of the Industrial Magistrate that there was an irresistible inference that the Union, by its officers, played a significant part in the activities which led to the withdrawal of labour and breached the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">47 The appellants submit that the evidence left no room for his Honour to conclude there was an 'irresistible inference' of involvement in the activities leading to the withdrawal of labour and in turn the breach of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Further, given the undisputed fact that the appellants had taken positive steps to prevent the withdrawal of labour at the meetings of the workforce, it is submitted that a finding of indirect engagement in industrial action was not, in any event, open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Additionally, it is submitted that it is not apparent from the reasons for decision that the Industrial Magistrate appreciated that the case against the appellants for the contravention of s 170MN of the Act was limited to the industrial action alleged to have occurred on 29 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">48 The appellants also state that as is apparent from the above quoted findings of the Industrial Magistrate in respect of s 170MN, his finding was of direct involvement only and that the reliance on the site shop steward was not a matter pleaded in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">49 As has been seen from the earlier reference to the terms of s 170NM, it prohibits industrial action:
 
 (a) by unions (including officers and employees) a party to, and employees covered by, a certified agreement; and (b) taken for the purposes of supporting or advancing claims against the employer in respect of the employment of employees whose employment is subject to a certified agreement; and (c) in relation to matters agreed upon in a certified agreement; and (d) before the nominal expiry date of the certified agreement as passed, 

 Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2003] FCAFC 183 ; (2003) 130 FCR 524 at 533-535 per French and von Doussa JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">50 It was not in dispute that the evidence established that the Employees (including Mr Levy, the shop steward and a member of the Union) who were subject to the Agreement took industrial action, as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, by the cessation of work on 29 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">51 There was evidence before the Industrial Magistrate that the industrial action was taken for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims against the Employer in respect of the employment of the Employees whose employment was subject to the Agreement in relation to the Issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">In his recitation of prosecution evidence given by Mr Radalj and quoted above, the Industrial Magistrate relied on evidence that after meeting with the workforce, Messrs Powell and Molina attended at the Project office and raised with Mr Radalj the issues of the inclement weather conditions and special project allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In recounting evidence given by Mr Powell, the Industrial Magistrate said that he and Mr Molina had attended the Project on 29 July 2004 where the issues raised were about those two matters as well as safety issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">He further recounted the evidence of Mr Aleknavicius to the effect that the meeting of 29 July 2004 was one which asked Mr Powell to go to talk to management in relation to the same two matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Those matters were subject of a provision in the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">This evidence recounted was but part of the evidential matrix before the Industrial Magistrate entitling him to conclude that the purpose of the meeting was as he found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">There was no basis on the evidence concluding that the Issues were merely 'matters related to interpretation or the like'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Indeed, Mr Molina said in cross-examination that the Union was not pursuing extra claims but rather asking for a particular clause to be changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">52 The evidence of the involvement of the Union and of its officers and employees was as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">53 Messrs Powell and Molina as organisers were officers and employees of the Union and were acting in their capacities as officers and employees of it when they went to the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Additionally they were Branch Council delegates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">They represented the Employees and they engaged themselves in the dispute by conveying information from the Employees to the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">54 Mr Levy, the shop steward was an employee of the Employer and a member of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">His position was recognised under the rules of the Union (r 57) and in cl 7.3 of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">As was said by Wilcox J in Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd v Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees' Union (No 2) (1987) 15 FCR 64 at 78, the function of a job delegate is to act as the link between the union members on a particular job and management, and to be on the site, the voice of the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Consequently, when the job delegate speaks to management about the union position on an industrial matter prima facie he or she speaks for the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">While Mr Levy was not relied upon in the amended statement of claim, nevertheless the evidence relating to him was part of the evidentiary matrix which required consideration by the Industrial Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">55 When the Employees stopped work, went on strike and left the Project on 29 July 2004, it was in relation to claims concerning the Issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">That is, claims arising under the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Mr Powell went and talked to the Employer about the Issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He and Mr Molina in their capacity as employees and officers of the Union, came to the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Prior to doing so they spoke to Mr Levy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Levy in his capacity as shop steward organised the meeting of the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">At the meeting a cessation of work was resolved upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr Levy in his capacity as shop steward and Union member and Mr Powell or Mr Molina in their capacities as officers and employees of the Union told the Employer that there was to be a cessation of work and actively pursued the issues with that company while the cessation of work continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">56 The position therefore was that Messrs Powell and Molina pursued a resolution to the Issues with the Employer prior to the cessation of work occurring; while the cessation of work was taking place; and until the Issues were resolved to the satisfaction of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">57 The Industrial Magistrate was bound to apply the provisions of s 170MN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He was required to take into account the conduct, not only of the Employees but also of the Union and of any officer or employee of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He was required to do this in the context of the provision in s 4(8) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">There was abundant evidence, the outline of which appears immediately above, entitling him to reach the conclusions which he did of direct involvement by the appellants in a breach of s 170MN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">58 That view however requires testing against the issues raised by the next two groupings of the grounds of appeal in particular, relating to the allegedly preventative steps taken by the Union officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">EFFECT OF STEPS TAKEN BY APPELLANTS TO PREVENT INDUSTRIAL ACTION 
 Error of law in finding of contravention in face of such steps: Grounds 2, 3, 4(e), 4(f), 4(g), 5(a)-5(c) and 21 
 
 Errors of fact in face of such steps: Grounds 2, 3, 4(a), 4(d), 4(g), 5(d)-5(e), 6, 10, 11, 20(b)-20(d) and 21 
 
59 So far as these grounds repeat the issues addressed in the preceding ground, they are not further addressed here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The principle evidence related to these grounds is that said by the appellants to establish that the appellants as the 'Union' took positive steps to prevent the withdrawal of labour by the Employees and that the decisions to withdraw labour were those of the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">This submission relies on evidence of actions taken by Mr Powell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">For example, in the examination-in-chief of Mr Aleknavicius he testified that on 29 July 2004 Mr Powell had spoken against the motion to go out on strike and told the workers that he still wanted to try and negotiate with the Employer at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">This advice had been ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In cross-examination Mr Levy testified that on 9 July 2004, once the vote had been taken to withdraw, Mr Powell had said to the workers that they were going down the wrong path and that they should leave the matters open for negotiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">60 The respondent challenges the claim of the appellant that the actions taken in this respect are capable of being characterised as intended to be preventative of the undertaking of industrial action by the workers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">It is said this is so because the evidence demonstrates that Mr Powell, Mr Molina and Mr Levy pursued the Issues with the Employer after the cessation of work began and while it continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I accept that there is appropriate evidence that was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In the case of s 178 of the Act, the respondent contends the cessation of work itself was sufficient to establish the liability of the first appellant under that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In the case of s 170MN, the respondent relies on the evidence principally referred to in connection with the preceding group of grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">61 The contentions of the appellants in relation to preventative action can only be of significance if it is open to acceptance that the 'Union' (being relevantly the appellants) acted as a separate juristic entity from the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In my opinion, this simply cannot be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">I have set out earlier in these reasons the particulars of the constitutional arrangements of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Examination of that shows that the Union consists of the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The Union comprises every part of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">There is no constitutional concept of the Union on the one hand and the Employees on the other hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Employees are as much an integral part of the Union as the officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The consequence is that if the Employees make a decision to go on strike, the Union is on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">62 Once it is understood that a duality of juridical existence is not possible between the Employees and the Union, the evidence falls for consideration in this light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">If officials of the Union did give advice to the Employees that they would be wiser to follow a path of negotiation, that cannot exempt the Union from any liability from the undertaking of industrial action when the Employees embark upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In Skilled Engineering Limited v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2001) 108 IR 116 at 119 Finkelstein J relied upon evidence of union organisers having been involved in discussions with employer management about the two issues of concern which caused workers to walk off the site, to suggest that they had a role to play in organising the strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">(There were additional affidavits and a failure to deny the unions were concerned in the strike which supported such an inference being drawn).</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">63 Ground 5(c) contends that the Industrial Magistrate was in error in acting on the erroneous principle that the actions of the Employees (the Union's members) or the site steward could constitute engagement in industrial action by the Union for the purposes of the relevant provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In argument in reply the appellants relied on Kelly v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (1994) 56 IR 373 at 380-381 and Rowe v Transport Workers' Union (1998) 90 FCR 95 at 112 which in turn cited Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattras (1971) 2 WLR 1166.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The submission is that the provisions at issue in these decisions were 'widening' provisions of which there is no equivalent in the legislative provisions in issue here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The essential point of the submission for the appellants was that the Union is a separate juristic entity so that, absent evidence the Union was authorised to act on behalf of the Employees, the latter cannot be liable for the actions of the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Added to this was the submission that there was no evidence of membership before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">64 These submissions fall, firstly, because a proper understanding of the Constitution of the Union shows that it is not a separate juristic entity from its members, in this case the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Secondly, the absence of provisions such as those at issue in Kelly and in Rowe does not mean that the evidence pertaining to the Union cannot establish the nature of its juristic character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">As Cooper J stated in Rowe at 112, it is only after the relevant facts are ascertained that the issue of the conduct of an individual in relation to the body corporate becomes a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">65 Thirdly, as to evidence of membership, the appellants contend that the evidence of Mr Levy could not be taken into account because he was not the agent or representative of the Union, as they juridically perceive it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Likewise they contend the evidence of the actions of the Employees was not relevant on the basis this is not conduct of the Union, as they perceive it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">That, in their submission, left the evidence only of Mr Aleknavicius, Mr Powell and Mr Molina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Of these, Mr Powell on the evidence spoke against the Employees going out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">66 However, these submissions are grounded in the error of perception of the Union as juridically separate from its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Additionally there was evidence Mr Levy and Mr Aleknavicius were members of the Union who participated in the meetings and left the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">There is also their evidence on what the other Employees did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Their evidence included reference to actions of Employees of the Employer capable of breaching the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">There was therefore evidence from which the Industrial Magistrate could draw inferences relevant to the finding of a breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">67 In short I do not perceive any error of law or of fact by the learned Industrial Magistrate in terms of the issues raised by these grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">LACK OF REASONS FOR DECISION: GROUNDS 4, 20(a), 21, 22 
 
68 It is firstly contended that the Industrial Magistrate failed to provide any, or any adequate, reasons for the decision that the appellants had breached the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It is submitted that he failed to examine the evidence with sufficient care or to explain why important parts of that evidence were apparently rejected: Waterways Authority v Fitzgibbon [2005] HCA 57 ; (2005) 221 ALR 402 at [85] - [87] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The appellants argue that the drawing of the 'irresistible inference' was vitiated by error as the effect of the evidence was that it showed the appellants had taken positive steps to prevent the withdrawal of labour: Rosenberg v Percival [2001] HCA 18 ; (2001) 205 CLR 434 at 447-448 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is further submitted that the resolutions of the Employees were expressions of their will alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">These submissions cannot be accepted in the light of the above resolution of the juridical character of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">69 Ground 20 is directed to 'the extent that the Learned Industrial Magistrate found that Appellants breach section 178 of the Act (which is denied) ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">I agree with the appellants no such breach was expressly found by the Industrial Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Section 178 is a facilitative provision appearing in Pt VIII of the Act relating to compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">70 The adequacy of the reasons of the Industrial Magistrate in relation to issue of breach of the dispute settlement procedure is considered below in connection with other issues concerning that procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">71 Then the appellants contend that the Industrial Magistrate erred to the extent that he found that the appellants had breached s 170MN of the Act on dates other than 29 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The appeal was conducted on the basis that the finding was only in respect of that date, so that contention does not require further consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">FAILURE TO APPLY BRIGINSHAW v BRIGINSHAW: GROUNDS 2, 3, 4, 5 AND 6 
 
72 In Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 Dixon J at 362-363 stated that 'reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved' so that where there is a serious allegation such satisfaction 'should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">That is, 'the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">73 The grounds under this head seek to challenge the finding of engagement in industrial action, the reliance on the 'irresistible inference', the finding of direct involvement in any industrial action and of the pursuit of the Issues by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">74 In my view, this ground adds nothing to the first series of grounds considered in the context of the second grouping of grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">For reasons there given, I have found no error in the conclusions of the Industrial Magistrate in respect of the matters raised by these grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">There was in his reasoning in that respect no failure to bring requisite care to the evidence upon which he founded his findings and reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">His reasons were not dependent upon inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I do not consider this ground succeeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">ERRONEOUS INTERPRETATION OF DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE: GROUNDS 12, 13 AND 14 
 
75 The first of these grounds raises the contention that the Industrial Magistrate erred in his construction of the dispute resolution procedure in cl 4.5 of the Agreement in three ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">First, he failed to adopt an interpretation which recognised the appellants' obligations to be involved in the disputations which gave rise to the withdrawal of labour by the Employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Second, he failed to adopt an interpretation which required the Employer to reduce the nature of the dispute to writing in step 4 of the clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Alternatively, he failed to find that cl 4.5 was ambiguous and not capable of being breached by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">76 The starting point for the application of cl 4.5 is the requirement that 'work shall continue in the usual manner without loss of time or wages and without bans or limitations so as to allow the steps...to be followed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It is patent that because of non-compliance with this condition, the appellants did not seek to invoke the dispute resolution procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It was therefore not an issue in the way in which the grounds contend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The Industrial Magistrate was therefore entitled to conclude that there was no evidence of any bona fide attempt by the Union to follow the procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Accordingly, no issue of the adequacy of his reasons can arise in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">77 The respondent relies on this cessation of work by the Union to ground, in any event, its liability under s 178 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">While that section does not have application to Mr Powell or Mr Molina, it is an alternative basis of liability and therefore support for the reasoning of his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">78 The last of the grounds under this head raises the additional contention that the Industrial Magistrate erred in finding that the Employees withdrew their labour in breach of the Agreement when he should have found that the Employer breached the Agreement by not complying with the steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph, there is no substance in this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">DENIALS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS: GROUNDS 15, 16 AND 22 
 
79 The appellants contend that the case was decided on issues other than those pleaded in the amended statement of claim so that there was a denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">80 Clause 6.1 of the Agreement provided a procedure for steps to be taken for dealing with and resolving safety issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The first of the grounds in this group asserts that 'to the extent' that the Industrial Magistrate found that the appellants breached cl 6.1 of the Agreement he erred in certain respects in fact and law, including denying procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The second asserts that procedural fairness was denied when the Industrial Magistrate relied on evidence relating to rights of entry which was expressly conceded by the respondent as being irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The third ground has been addressed above in dealing with the grounds relating to alleged lack of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">81 The remaining two grounds do not appear to have been further pursued either in oral or written argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In any event, they are entirely peripheral to the foundations of the principle conclusion of the Industrial Magistrate in respect of liability under s 170MN of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">VARIOUS FACTUAL ERRORS: GROUNDS 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 AND 19 
 
82 Again, the 'factual errors' referred to in these grounds have not been pursued in detail, are in any event caught up in wider issues raised by other grounds or are peripheral to the principle conclusions of the Industrial Magistrate on liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Ground 17 asserts that the Industrial Magistrate erred in fact in finding that the Employees withdrew their labour on 9 July 2004 for the sole purpose of pursuing the Issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">There was evidence upon which that inference was open to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">CONCLUSION 
 
83 For these reasons the appeal against the judgment of his Honour must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">In that circumstance the respondent's notice of contention does not arise for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">I certify that the preceding eighty-three (83) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.</sentence>
