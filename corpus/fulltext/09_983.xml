 1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Hneidi v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 104 ALD 668.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appeal to this Court is limited to an appeal on a question of law ( Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act") s 44(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The first applicant holds both Syrian and Lebanese citizenship, and he currently resides in Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He is married to Ms Karina Hneidi, who holds both Australian and Lebanese citizenship, and there are four children of the marriage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">One of the applicant's children holds Australian citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 On 30 October 2006, the first applicant made an application for Australian citizenship for himself and for the three children who did not hold Australian citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 1 June 2007, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In his reasons, the delegate did not specifically provide reasons for refusing the applications with respect to the three children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On the application for review to the Tribunal, the Tribunal member said that as the three children had been joined to the first applicant's application then "by implication" the applications by the children had also been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 On 27 June 2007, the first applicant made an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">That application was made both with respect to the first applicant's application and that of his three children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Tribunal was satisfied that it had jurisdiction to consider a review of the delegate's decision with respect to the children as well as the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal held that it had this power where the children were joined as parties to the application before the Tribunal and, at the hearing, an order was made by consent under s 30(1A) of the AAT Act joining the three children as separate parties to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It was agreed between the parties that the applications by the children were not dependent on the outcome of the first applicant's application and should be separately considered on their own merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 On 16 October 2008, the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The relevant legislative provisions
 
 6 As I have said, the first applicant's application was made on 30 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth) came into operation on 1 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It was common ground before the Tribunal that, as the first applicant had lodged his application prior to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth) coming into operation, his application, and those of his three children, must be considered under the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (Cth) ("the Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 Section 13 of the Act gives the Minister the power to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Under s 13(9)(a), the Minister may, in his discretion, upon application in accordance with the approved form, grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to a person who has not attained the age of 18 years, and, under s 13(9)(c), the Minister may grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to a person who is a permanent resident and is the spouse, widow or widower of an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The first applicant's application must be considered under s 13(9)(c), and those of the second, third and fourth applicants (that is, the three children) must be considered under s 13(9)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There are policy guidelines relevant to the exercise of the discretions contained in s 13(9)(c) and s 13(9)(a) respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">They are known as the Australian Citizenship Instructions ("the Instructions").</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The evidence before me establishes that the relevant instructions are those which were in effect on 30 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It also establishes that the Instructions are a departmental document designed "to provide policy guidance to Departmental decision-makers in relation to the interpretation of, and the exercise of powers under, the citizenship legislation regulations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The evidence establishes that the text of the Instructions was approved by a senior departmental officer, not the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary and that, as a general principle, the department seeks the approval of the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary for significant citizenship policy changes on what is said to be an "as-needed" basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 Chapter 4 of the Instructions deals with the grant of a certificate of Australian citizenship and, in particular, the criteria for the grant of a certificate of citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Clause 4.1.2 states that Chapter 4 "sets out the legislative requirements and also the policy that gives guidance on how to exercise discretions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The relevant version of chapter 4 of the Instructions was cleared for publication by the Assistant Secretary, Citizenship and Language Services Branch, on 15 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I infer from the evidence put before me that the Instructions were not put before Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 In short, the Instructions are a form of departmental policy, as they were approved by a senior departmental officer, not the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 Clause 4.5 of the Instructions addresses the discretionary power contained in s 13(9)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The clause provides as follows:
 
 
 "4.5 SPOUSES, WIDOWS &amp; WIDOWERS OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS s 13(9)(c) 
 

 
 
 4.5.1 Section 13(9)(c) gives a discretion to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to a permanent resident who is the legal spouse, widow or widower of an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 

 
 
 4.5.2 Applicants are usually required to meet all of the following requirements: 
 
 the applicant is a permanent resident the parties are living together as husband and wife unless: 
 
 - the Australian citizen spouse has died; in this case, the couple must have been living together at the time the spouse died or
 - the applicant and the Australian spouse are estranged because of domestic violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Note: If the parties are not living together but claim that the marriage exists, the case should be decided by an officer at APS6 level or higher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 the applicant is of good character (see chapter 5) if the applicant is overseas, they intend travelling to Australia to live with the Australian citizen spouse the applicant is likely, if granted a certificate of Australian citizenship, to reside, or to continue to reside, in Australia, or to maintain a close and continuing association with Australia (see 4.2.18 --- 4.2.20) the applicant has a basic knowledge of the English language and an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship the applicant has been present in Australia as a permanent resident for at least 2 years in the five years immediately before the application, at least 12 months of which must have been within the 2 years immediately prior to that date unless: 
 
 - the applicant has been a permanent resident in Australia continuously for the 12 months immediately prior to application and would otherwise suffer significant hardship or disadvantage (see 4.3.33 for guidance on hardship or disadvantage).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 

 
 
 4.5.3 Spouses of Australian citizens who live overseas with their Australian citizen spouse, and are permanent residents of Australia may have difficulty meeting the residence requirements for citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The primary policy objective underpinning the residence requirements is the development and maintenance of close and continuing ties with Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This policy objective can be achieved through the applicant's relationship with their Australian citizen spouse, children if any, extended family, and through return visits to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 

 
 
 4.5.4 Spouses of Australian citizens would usually be eligible for grant of citizenship if they: 
 
 are permanent residents of Australia live or have lived overseas with their Australian citizen spouse because of the Australian citizen's work; and would have been eligible for citizenship if they were residing in Australia during that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 4.5.5 The occupation of the Australian citizen spouse is not relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Evidence, however, of the Australian citizen's spouse overseas employment is required, such as, a letter from the employer, including a statement that the non citizen spouse is accompanying them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" 
 

 
 11 The relevant clauses in the Instructions for the purpose of the discretionary power in s 13(9)(a) of the Act are as follows:
 
 
 " 4.4 CHILDREN --- GRANT IN THEIR OWN RIGHT s13(9)(a) &amp; (b ) 
 

 
 
 ...
 4.4.3 As a matter of policy, applications under s 13(9)(a) and s 13(9)(b) will usually be approved if: 
 
 the applicant is at least 16 years old and is the natural child of a person who has been granted a certificate of Australian citizenship on the basis of being the spouse of an Australian citizen or the applicant is at least 16 years old and meets the criteria in 4.2; the applicant has not turned 16 and, although their parents are not Australian citizens, the applicant would otherwise suffer hardship or disadvantage (see 4.3.33) the applicant has been adopted overseas and satisfies the requirements set out in 4.4.12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 4.4.4 In considering an application under s 13(9), applications are not usually approved unless all of the following are satisfied: 
 
 the child is a 'permanent resident' (see 1.4) or meets the requirements for migration to, or permanent residence in, Australia and the child has a 'responsible parent' (see 1.6) who is an Australian citizen and who consents to the application (Note: if the child is a ward of the Minister for Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (eg an unaccompanied humanitarian minor (UHM) or certain cases of overseas adoption), the Minister's parental rights are exclusive and the case should be referred to Family Section, National Office or the State/Territory office Settlement area or UHM Coordinator for advice) and if the child is under 16 years old, they are living with that responsible parent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">If the applicant is in the care of another person (eg brother, aunt or uncle), the case is to be referred to a delegate of at least APS 6 level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(Note: this would include an applicant who is a 'non-ward' under the UHM program --- see 1.6.12)
 
 
 4.4.5 Delegates are reminded that they must consider the full circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">For example, it may be appropriate to approve a case outside policy if the child (other than an adopted child) has a responsible parent who is an Australian citizen and there are exceptional circumstances which would make it unreasonable for the applicant to apply for a permanent visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">" 
 

 The facts and the conclusions reached by the Tribunal
 
 12 There was no dispute before the Tribunal as to the relevant facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The summary of the facts which follows is taken from the Tribunal member's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">13 The first applicant was born in Moscow on 27 February 1996 to Syrian parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He is a nephrologist by profession and he conducts dialysis clinics in Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Prior to 1997, he was studying and working in Syria and France, and, after that time, he has lived and worked in Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 As I have said, the first applicant's wife is an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Her mother was born in Australia to migrant Lebanese parents and is an Australian citizen by birth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Ms Hneidi's mother returned to reside in Lebanon in 1966, and Ms Hneidi was born in Beirut and has lived there throughout her life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">She was granted Australian citizenship in 1971 by the Australian Embassy in London.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">She obtained Australian citizenship by descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">She is also a Lebanese citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">15 The first applicant is of good character and he speaks the English language fluently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He married Ms Hneidi on 25 August 1995 and the first applicant and Ms Hneidi continue to reside together as man and wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Ms Hneidi has a grandmother, an aunt and uncle, eight cousins and a sister, who reside in Australia and she remains in contact with all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 The four children of the marriage are: Ramy (born on 10 September 1996), Dalia (born on 22 October 1997), Maya (born on 7 November 2001) and Tala (born on 2 August 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Ms Hneidi was in Australia in 2001, and Maya was born during her stay here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Maya is an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The other three children were not born in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">17 The first applicant applied for a sub-class 100 spouse visa for himself and his two oldest children in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The application was granted and the first applicant thereby became a permanent Australian resident on 27 September 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">At the time, the first applicant was working as a medical specialist at the Mt Lebanon Hospital in Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Ramy, Dalia and Tala all hold Australian permanent residency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Ramy and Dalia were granted sub-class 155 resident return visas on 14 September 2006 and Tala was granted a sub-class 101 child visa on 8 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">18 The first applicant, Ms Hneidi and two of the children came to Australia in October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The first applicant stayed in Australia for 20 days and then returned to Lebanon when his father was taken ill unexpectedly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">On that occasion, he and his family had planned to stay for up to a year with a view to moving to Australia permanently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The first applicant had given notice to his employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">19 Ms Hneidi and the children returned to Lebanon to join the first applicant shortly thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The first applicant has not returned to Australia since 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Ms Hneidi has visited Australia on a number of occasions over the years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Records show that she was in Australia for one month in 1982, for a number of weeks in 1986, for two weeks in 1992, for two months in 2001, two months in 2006 and three weeks in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">20 In July 2006, hostilities broke out in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, and the conflict continued for approximately one month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Both military personnel and civilians were killed, and many civilians, including the Hneidi family, were forced to flee from Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Tribunal member said:
 
 
 "The Australian Embassy could only offer assistance to Australian citizens who were resident in Lebanon during the evacuation and so only Karina and Maya could have received assistance from the Embassy in Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Evacuation was easier for an Australian citizen as they could be evacuated directly from Beirut Airport with the assistance of the Embassy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">As Karina was not willing to be separated from her family, she left with her husband and children via a much more dangerous route which involved travelling by road to Syria and then flying from Syria via Bahrain and Hong Kong to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 

 
 
 When Karina reached Hong Kong the three children who did not hold Australian citizenship were not allowed entry to Hong Kong, whereas Karina and Maya could have entered Hong Kong as Australian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Karina had to stay in transit with all four children for many hours as she could not leave the other three children at the airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 

 
 
 She arrived in Australia with the four children in July 2006 and stayed in Adelaide with her relatives for approximately two months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">She returned to Lebanon once it was safe for her and the children to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Her husband travelled as far as Syria and once the family was safe en route to Australia he returned to Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 

 
 
 On 13 March 2007, Dr Hneidi was granted a sub-class 155 resident return visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">He is able to live and work in Australia if he so wishes and he has a right of multiple re-entry under that visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">" 
 

 
 21 The Tribunal member found that the first applicant is one of a small number of specialists in his particular field in Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He established a business in partnership with others in Lebanon in 2003 and that business operates a number of clinics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">22 In 2005, the first applicant and his partners were looking to sell the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They entered into negotiations with a German company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Those negotiations were almost complete by mid-2006 when the hostilities broke out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Thereafter, the negotiations were put "on hold".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">23 The first applicant's father is in his mid-80s and in poor health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He resides near to the first applicant and Ms Hneidi and they visit him regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It is not possible for the first applicant's father to travel to Australia because of his age and poor health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Ms Hneidi's parents reside in Lebanon and are in quite good health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">24 The first applicant is currently owed a large sum of money by the Lebanese Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It is not certain when he will be paid this sum of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">25 The first applicant and Ms Hneidi opened a bank account at the Westpac Bank at Glenside, South Australia, and, in November 2007, they transferred the sum of $100,000 to that account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">There was no activity on that account between November 2007 and the date of the review hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The first applicant and Ms Hneidi enrolled their school age children to commence school at Linden Park Primary School in Adelaide in 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">At this point, they have not moved to Australia to enable the children to take up that enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">26 In her reasons, the Tribunal member summarised the evidence given by the applicant and Ms Hneidi by telephone from Beirut, and evidence given by Ms Hneidi's maternal aunt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It is not necessary for me to set out the details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">She found that the applicant and his wife were honest witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal member found that the major motivation behind the current application was the family's experience in mid-2006 when the Australian Embassy could only offer assistance to the Australian citizen members of the family in evacuating them from Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">They also discovered that travel was easier on that occasion as Australian citizens did not require visas in Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">27 The Tribunal member found that the Hneidi family hoped to come to Australia to live, but that they had not established any clear timeline for that move.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Tribunal member found that the timing of their move to Australia remained entirely uncertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">She said "it may be within the next two to five years but if it does not occur within that time then it may never occur if the children reach an age where they are more difficult to move from friends and peer groups".</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The Tribunal member found that the first applicant, Ms Hneidi and their children are a close family unit and will not be separated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">She found that the enrolments at Linden Park Primary School were not made in anticipation of any genuine expectation of being in Australia in 2008, and that the deposit of $100,000 into a bank account in Australia was made with no immediate plans to come to Australia and was possibly done to create a financial link with Australia for the purposes of the application or to protect funds and remove them from Lebanon which can be a volatile country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">28 The Tribunal member found that, if the Hneidi family does come to Australia, they will undoubtedly become valuable members of the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">She said that the first applicant is likely to make a significant contribution to the medical profession and that the family will ultimately be welcomed by the Australian community when and if they do decide to come here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 After setting out the rival contentions of the parties, the Tribunal member noted that the first applicant's application was to be considered under s 13(9)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">She noted that that paragraph was expressed in simple terms and that no criteria were set out in the Act to govern the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The Tribunal member referred to the factors set out in clause 4.5.2 of the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">She addressed first the requirement that an applicant "is likely, if granted a certificate of Australian citizenship, to reside, or to continue to reside in Australia, or to maintain a close and continuing association with Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Tribunal member said that the first applicant would probably come to Australia at some stage in the next few years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">However, he could not put any definite date on his entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">She found that the first applicant's major association was with his own country and that his association with Australia is through his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">She noted that he had visited Australia once and had not exercised his right to return and live in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">She said that his association with Australia as a culture and a nation was "not close".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">She referred to the first applicant's visit to Australia in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The Tribunal member concluded that the first applicant did not satisfy the residency requirements set out in clause 4.5.2 of the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">30 The Tribunal member referred to clause 4.5.3 and noted that the primary policy objective underpinning the residency requirement was the development and maintenance of close and continuing ties with Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The Tribunal member noted the argument that the first applicant did not receive the same protection from Australian Embassy representatives as his Australian wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Tribunal member said that she did not accept that "this argument holds sufficient weight that the usual policy should be ignored".</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">She said that she did not accept that the difficulty faced by the spouse of an Australian citizen in this case was "so significant or exceptional that policy should be ignored".</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">She said:
 
 
 "In the matters of Re Dainty v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1987) 6 AAR 259 and Re Vukaj v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] AATA 1075 , citizenship applications were granted even though the guidelines set out in the Instructions were not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">However, those cases are distinguishable from this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">In both those cases, the applicant was living in Australia at the time of the application and had much more substantial contact and association with Australia than Dr Hneidi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In each case, they were married to resident Australian citizens and had significant ongoing connections with Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">" 
 

 
 31 The Tribunal member noted that policy statements were not binding on the Tribunal "but must be brought to account and given appropriate weight".</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Tribunal member said that she could not see a sufficient basis to depart from the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">32 The Tribunal member then turned to consider the application by the second, third and fourth applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">She noted the relevant provisions of the Instructions and said that, based on the Instructions, the children would not usually be considered for citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The Tribunal member considered whether she needed to address the issue of the best interests of the children by reason of the fact that Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 3 refers to the "best interests of the child".</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">She referred to various authorities and concluded that she must give consideration to the children's best interests in this case as a primary consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">She considered the submission that the best interests of the children lie in coming to Australia with their family and in being able to travel as a single unit and in the safest way when travelling internationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Tribunal member said that she had considered that argument carefully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">She said it was really a value judgment to suggest that the children would be better off coming to live in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">She noted that the children could come to Australia at any time and reside here as they had visas which entitled them to do so, and the fact that they have not yet done so indicated that their parents were satisfied that their current best interests were served by continuing to reside with them in Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The Tribunal member concluded by saying:
 
 
 "Having considered the best interests of the children and having considered the policy directions and the underlying policy behind the grant of citizenship to children under the age of sixteen years, the Tribunal considers that there is no compelling reason to go behind the policy set out in the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">" 
 

 Questions of law and grounds of appeal
 
 33 The amended notice of appeal identifies two questions of law and three grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The first question of law and the ground of appeal related to it are as follows:
 
Question of law: 
 
 
 "Whether the Tribunal, upon a review of the decision by the Minister to not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship under subs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">13(9) of the Act, impermissibly fetters the exercise of its discretion by applying the policy known as the 'Australian citizenship instructions' unless there are cogent reasons not to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">" 
 

 
Ground of appeal:
 
 
 "The Tribunal failed to exercise its own independent judgment in respect of its decision, and give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the applicants' cases, in that it:
 (a) held that it was required to apply the policy known as the 'Australian citizenship instructions' unless there were cogent reasons not to do so;
 (b) applied the policy in making the decision; and
 (c) failed to hold that as the policy had not been adopted or approved by the Minister and had not been exposed to parliamentary scrutiny, the existence of the policy was merely a relevant consideration to take into account in the exercise of the discretion under subs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">13(9) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">" 
 

 
 34 The second question of law and the grounds of appeal related to it are as follows:
 
Question of law:
 
 
 "Whether, on the proper construction of subs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">13(9) of the Act, the Minister, in determining whether to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship, is bound to take into account whether members of the person's immediate family are Australian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">" 
 

 
Grounds of appeal:
 
 
 "The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of its power under para 13(9)(c) of the Act in respect of the first applicant, in that it failed to take into account that the first applicant's daughter with his Australian citizen wife was also an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 

 
 
 The Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration in the exercise of its power under para 13(9)(a) of the Act in respect of the second to fourth applicants, in that it failed to take into account that their sibling was an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">" 
 

 The first question of law and the first ground of appeal
 
 35 It is convenient at the outset to review briefly the principal authorities dealing with the role of policy in administrative decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">36 The starting point is the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 24 ALR 577 (" Drake ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">In Drake , the relevant power was the power of deportation in s 12 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) as it then was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The Minister had issued a policy statement on the question of considerations relating to the deterrence of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">A question which arose was whether the Tribunal had attached such importance to the policy statement as to result in a failure by the Tribunal to exercise its own independent judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Bowen CJ and Deane J discussed the general principles relating to the role of policy in administrative decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">37 Their Honours started by stating some general principles as to the role of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Those principles are now well known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">They include the fact that the role of the Tribunal is an administrative one and its task is to make the correct or preferable decision on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There may be cases in which the Tribunal is precluded from having regard to general government policy by the terms of the statutory power and other cases in which, again by the terms of the statutory power, the Tribunal is bound to apply principles laid down in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Absent statutory prescriptions of this nature, the Tribunal may take into account a policy and that is particularly so where the statute itself does not specify the criteria which are relevant to the exercise of the statutory power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In the ordinary case, a policy is a relevant factor for the Tribunal to take into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It is desirable in terms of consistency in decision-making that a policy be taken into account by the Tribunal and that follows from the fact that the original decision-maker has applied or taken into account the particular policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">However, the Tribunal cannot apply a policy in a way which indicates that, in truth, it has abdicated its function to reach the correct or preferable decision on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The weight to be placed on a policy is a matter for the Tribunal to determine and it will ordinarily do so, balancing the need for consistency in decision-making and the need for justice in the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">38 Bowen CJ and Deane J said the borderline between cases in which a Tribunal has, after an independent assessment, applied a government policy and cases in which a Tribunal has abdicated its function may well be blurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Their Honours said (at 591):
 
 
 "It is, however, desirable that, in any case where the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the particular circumstances are such as to make the correct or preferable decision that which results from an application of some government or ministerial policy to the particular facts, the Tribunal makes it clear that it has considered the propriety of the particular policy and expressly indicates the considerations which have led it to that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">This is particularly so in matters such as the review of a deportation order where no two cases will be identical and where personal liberty will commonly be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">" 
 

 
 39 The appeal was allowed in Drake and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The President of the Tribunal, Brennan J (as his Honour then was), conducted the rehearing: Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2) [1979] 2 ALD 634 (" Drake No 2 ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Brennan J referred to the advantages which flowed from the original decision-maker being able to be guided by policy statements, guidelines or standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The policy must be consistent with the statute and it must not be framed so as to preclude consideration of the merits of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Tribunal may apply the policy on a review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Brennan J said (at 643):
 
 
 "If the Tribunal applies ministerial policy, it is because of the assistance which the policy can furnish in arriving at the preferable decision in the circumstances of the case as they appear to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">One of the factors to be considered in arriving at the preferable decision in a particular case is its consistency with other decisions in comparable cases, and one of the most useful aids in achieving consistency is a guiding policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">" 
 

 
 40 Brennan J went on to explain why it was not convenient for the Tribunal to formulate policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">His Honour said that administrative policies are best formed and amended in a political context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In the course of his discussion, his Honour referred to the chain of responsibility from Minister to government to Parliament and to the fact that the bureaucracy is best placed to advise on broad policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">His Honour reached the following conclusions (at 645):
 
 
 "When the Tribunal is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary power reposed in a Minister, and the Minister has adopted a general policy to guide him in the exercise of the power, the Tribunal will ordinarily apply that policy in reviewing the decision, unless the policy is unlawful or unless its application tends to produce an unjust decision in the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Where the policy would ordinarily be applied, an argument against the policy itself or against its application in the particular case will be considered, but cogent reasons will have to be shown against its application, especially if the policy is shown to have been exposed to parliamentary scrutiny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 

 
 41 In an earlier decision, Brennan J, again sitting as the President of the Tribunal and on a review of a Minister's decision to order deportation under s 13(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (" Migration Act "), as it then was, drew a distinction between policies made or settled at the political level and policies made or settled at the departmental level: Re Becker and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1977) 1 ALD 158 at 163.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Different considerations may apply to the review of each kind of policy and more substantial reasons might need to be shown why policies forged at the political level should be reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">42 In Nevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 34 ALR 639 , the Full Court of this Court considered an appeal from the Tribunal on a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The Tribunal had reviewed a decision of the Minister to deport the applicant under s 12 of the Migration Act as it then was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The Tribunal had taken into account government policy on the deportation of persons involved in growing, importation or distribution of illicit drugs and had decided that the correct and preferable decision in all the circumstances of the case was that the applicant be deported from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Tribunal said that, absent the policy, its decision may have been different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Full Court dismissed the appeal and held that the Tribunal was entitled to take the policy into account as a relevant factor and that the weight to be accorded to the policy was a matter for that Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The Court also said that the Tribunal could not abdicate its function of determining the correct and preferable decision on the material before it by simply applying the policy without conducting an independent assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">43 In Re Aston and Secretary, Department of Primary Industry (1985) 8 ALD 366 (" Re Aston "), the Tribunal (of which Davies J was the President) considered the correct and preferable decision on the material before it in relation to an allocation of a quota of Southern bluefin tuna under a scheme limiting the taking of tuna adopted pursuant to the Fisheries Act 1952 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The Tribunal quoted extensively from the reasons for judgment of Brennan J in Drake (No 2) and noted the reasons why, in the circumstances of Re Aston , it was appropriate to place great weight on the policy (at 380):
 
 
 "There being no special circumstances which affected the Astons, this is pre-eminently the type of matter in which the policy adopted by the primary decision-maker ought to be applied by this Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The policy affected an industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It was a policy decided upon at the highest level, being resolved upon by the Australian Fisheries Council comprised of the six relevant Ministers of the States and the Federal Minister for Primary Industry and the Federal Minister for Science and Technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It was a policy which could only be developed in the political arena after consultation with industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The Tribunal, which is not accountable politically and which cannot proceed by obtaining industry consensus, must give such a policy great weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">" 
 

 
 44 In Re Dainty and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1987) 6 AAR 259 (" Re Dainty "), Davies J, as President of the Tribunal, reversed the decision of the delegate under s 13(9)(c) of the Act and decided that the Minister's guidelines were not appropriate to the applicant's circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">45 In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Others (1989) 18 ALD 679 , this Court was required to consider a decision of the Tribunal granting the applicant relief under s 5(4) of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">There was a ruling of the Commissioner which specified the circumstances in which relief should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">After referring to the particular policy which was in issue in Re Aston , French J (as his Honour then was) said (at 692):
 
 
 "And, as in that case, which involved the exercise of a discretion to limit the terms of fishing licences under a national quota scheme, a policy which is developed in the political arena after consultation with the relevant industry ought generally to be given great weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Taxation ruling IT 2063 does not appear to be in that category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Nevertheless, the magnitude of the task involved in carrying out original decision-making and supervising and regulating the exercise of delegated authority under the taxation laws, is a powerful indicator that appropriate guidelines are essential for the avoidance of administrative chaos and for the achievement of reasonable consistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The need to maintain the perception and reality of equal treatment is an important factor in the administration of all laws and not least in those relating to taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">But such considerations go to the weight to be attributed to policy and that is ultimately a matter for the Tribunal: Nevistic v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, supra , at 647 (Deane J); Re Aston, supra , at AAR 78 (Davies J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">" 
 

 
 46 Finally, I mention that I was referred to the Tribunal's decision in Re Lofthouse and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] AATA 327 ; (2004) 82 ALD 481 , a case involving consideration of the weight to be given to a Policy Statement formulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">47 I turn now to examine the Tribunal's reasons in light of these principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">48 The Tribunal member did not discuss the source of the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">She did not discuss whether the Instructions had been made by the Minister or by senior officers in the Minister's Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">She appears to have proceeded on the basis that the Instructions were Ministerial Guidelines rather than Departmental Guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">She formulated one of the issues before the Tribunal as:
 
 
 "... to what extent can the Tribunal go outside the Ministerial Guidelines (the Guidelines) in exercising its discretion?</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">" 
 

 
 49 She referred to Re Dainty and a passage from the reasons for judgment of Davies J where, in the context of the discretionary power in s 13(9)(c) of the Act, his Honour referred to Guidelines or policies established by the Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Although it is not entirely clear, it appears that, at the time of the decision in Re Dainty , that is, 1987, the relevant guidelines or policies were Ministerial guidelines or policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">50 It seems to me that the overarching principle in this area is that the Tribunal must make an independent assessment on the material before it with a view to reaching the correct or preferable decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The other principles referred to in the authorities are subordinate to this principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">For example, although the authorities are clear that the weight to be placed on a policy is a matter for the Tribunal, this principle cannot be pushed past the point at which the Tribunal no longer makes an independent assessment on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">At the same time, although there are authorities to the effect that a policy is no more than a relevant factor to be taken into account, there may be cases where, after a consideration of the facts, it is clear that the policy must be applied and there is little to be said against such a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">51 The evidence before this Court establishes that the Instructions were Departmental guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The Tribunal member erred in proceeding on the basis that the Instructions were Ministerial guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In fairness to her, it does not seem from her reasons that the point was raised before her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicants accepts, correctly in my view, that this error was an error of fact not law, and that of itself does not give rise to a question of law and error of law entitling the applicants to relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">However, he submits that the error is a factor which supports the conclusion that the Tribunal member did commit the error of law identified in the first ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">52 In this case, the Tribunal member used various expressions in the course of addressing the Instructions and the facts put by the applicants against their application in the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The applicants emphasised the Tribunal member's statements that a particular argument did not hold "sufficient weight that the usual policy should be ignored" or that a particular fact was not "so significant or exceptional that policy should be ignored" or that there was "no sufficient basis in this case to depart from the Instructions" or that "there is no compelling reason to go behind the policy set out in the Instructions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">For his part, the respondent referred to statements by the Tribunal member "that the Tribunal must have regard to these Instructions, unless there is good reason not to do so", statements to the effect that the policy in the Instructions should not be ignored, that the Instructions are "not binding" and a guide only and that "the Instructions and underlying policy cannot be disregarded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">53 The applicants identified a number of features of the Tribunal member's reasons which, they submitted, should lead to the conclusion that she did not make an independent assessment on the material before her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">54 First, the applicants submitted that the Tribunal member did not state that her task was to make an independent assessment of the material before her with a view to reaching the correct or preferable decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It seems to me that had she said that it might have helped the respondent meet the applicants' argument, but its absence is not of great significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">55 Secondly, the applicants submitted that the Tribunal member had not considered the propriety of the Instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">There are two answers to this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">First, where a policy is lawful, the Tribunal would not normally consider the propriety of the policy as a policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">It would consider the propriety of applying the policy to the facts of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">I am satisfied that the Tribunal member did that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The second answer is that, by reference to some observations in Re Sadiq and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] AATA 75 , the Tribunal member did give consideration to the propriety of the policy as a policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">56 Thirdly, the applicants submitted that the Tribunal member misdirected herself in law because she referred to two cases, namely: Drake No 2 and Re Dainty , which discussed the relevant principles in the context of ministerial policy, not departmental policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The answers to this submission are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">A fair reading of the Tribunal member's reasons reveals that she did not adopt an incorrect approach to the Instructions as departmental policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">In so far as it might be said that she placed greater weight on the Instructions than was called for, that was a question of weight which was a matter for the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">57 The reasons of the Tribunal are not to be read with an eye keenly attuned to error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It was not suggested that the Instructions are unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In any event, I would reject such a contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Key elements of the Instructions simply reflect important criteria in s 13(1) of the Act which deals with a grant of a certificate of citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The fundamental question is whether the Tribunal member made an independent assessment on the material before her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">I think that she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">58 I reject the first ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The second question of law and the second and third grounds of appeal
 
 59 The respondent accepted that when a decision-maker is determining whether to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship under s 13(9) of the Act, he or she is bound to take into account whether members of the person's immediate family are Australian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicants submitted that the matter was not taken into account and that that was an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The respondent submitted that this matter was taken into account by the Tribunal both in relation to the first applicant's application and the application of the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">60 It may appear from the Tribunal's reasons that a consideration was taken into account even though it is not expressly mentioned ( Turner v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 35 ALR 388 at 392 per Toohey J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It seems to me that the inference that the matter was taken into account will be more easily drawn if the consideration is one of less significance than other considerations in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">It seems to me that the fact that Maya is an Australian citizen is of less significance than other considerations in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">61 Plainly, the Tribunal was aware and made reference to the fact that Maya was an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">I am satisfied that the matter was taken into account because the Tribunal member contrasted the position of Ms Hneidi and Maya with the first applicant and the three children in terms of assistance from the Australian Embassy and ease of international travel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">62 I reject the second and third grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Conclusion
 
 63 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
