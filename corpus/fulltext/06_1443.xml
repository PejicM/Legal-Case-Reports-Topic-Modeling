<sentence id="s0">
 BACKGROUND 
 
1 The applicant is a company incorporated in accordance with the laws of the Republic of France.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">At all material times it was the registered owner of various trademarks identified in par 4 of the amended statement of claim (the "Louis Vuitton trademarks").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The relevant certificates of registration appear in exhibit 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At all material times the applicant and/or its agents have manufactured and/or marketed various products, utilizing one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The applicant pleads that the first respondent ("Toea") has at all material times been 'the landlord of and the party responsible for operating, supervising and controlling a market at Nerang-Broadbeach Road, Carrara in the State of Queensland' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That market is hereinafter described as the "Market".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant also alleges that the second respondent ("Mr Rosenlund") has at all material times been the full-time manager of, and person responsible for operating, supervising and controlling the Market on behalf of Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">There are more than 400 stalls at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Traders occupy stalls pursuant to agreements entered into with Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant alleges that various stallholders have breached one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It does not seek relief against those stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It rather seeks relief as against Toea and Mr Rosenlund, alleging that at all relevant times they:
 
 &#8226; were aware that stallholders were infringing the Louis Vuitton trademarks;
 &#8226; permitted them to continue trading at the Market;
 &#8226; failed to take adequate steps to prevent them from further infringing the trademarks; and 
 &#8226; derived financial advantage from such continued trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">

It is said that such conduct constituted infringement of the relevant trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 It will not be necessary to describe the Louis Vuitton trademarks in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The respondents have not seriously disputed the allegations concerning infringement by individual stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The question is whether, in those circumstances, the respondents, or either of them, infringed the trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It will, however, be necessary to say a little about the applicant's business, or more particularly, about the way in which its products are marketed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It will also be necessary to say a little more about the operation of the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">THE APPLICANT'S PRODUCTS AND MARKETING SYSTEM 
 
4 The applicant manufactures luggage, hand bags and a wide range of other accessories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It supplies its products directly to retail outlets throughout the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Louis Vuitton Australia Pty Ltd ("LV Australia"), which is a member of a worldwide group of companies controlled by the applicant, is responsible for the importation, distribution, promotion and sale in Australia of the applicant's products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Such products are only retailed through outlets which are owned by LV Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The products are extremely high-quality and priced at the upper end of the market for such goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Employees of LV Australia are trained in various aspects of the manufacture and promotion of Louis Vuitton goods, including design and methods of manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">This training is designed to assist in the identification of "counterfeit" goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">THE MARKET 
 
5 Mr Rosenlund is employed as the manager of the Market and is a director of Toea, having been appointed to that office on 11 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Toea owns and operates the Market as trustee of the Toea Unit Trust and trades under the business name "Carrara Markets".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Market is situated on approximately ten acres of land on the Nerang-Broadbeach Road at Carrara on the Gold Coast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Toea owns the land which is comprised of two lots, separated by Gin House Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Market is open to the public from 7.30 am to 4.00 pm on each Saturday and Sunday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It is the largest such market on the Gold Coast, comprising approximately 450 stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Stallholders are either permanent stallholders, long-term casual stallholders or casual stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">6 There are approximately 400 permanent stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Each is granted a licence to occupy a specific stall for a weekly fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Four of those stallholders, having stalls situated on the perimeter of the Markets with direct street access, trade seven days a week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The remaining permanent stallholders trade only on weekends, although they have continuous access to their stalls so that they may attend to maintenance, restocking and setting up for weekend trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Permanent stallholders may make improvements to their stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Many erect signage and permanent structures which enable them to lock up and secure stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Many have expensive equipment and fit-out in much the same way as would a retail shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Permanent allocation and the ability to make improvements allow a permanent stallholder to develop goodwill in the business operated from his or her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">7 Since Mr Rosenlund commenced as manager in 1997, he has required that all new permanent stallholders enter into a "licence to occupy" in the form of exhibit JMR 3 to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The licence provides as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Licensor does grant to the Licensee a license to occupy the stall for the weekly fee commencing on the date first set ... 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Licensee will occupy the stall on days or hours based on arrangement with the Licensor upon payment of the relevant ... 
 The Licensee must specifically occupy the stall between the hours of 7.30am and close of markets each Saturday and Sunday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">At the expiration of each weekend the Licensee shall leave the stall in a neat, tidy and clean condition to the satisfaction of the Licensor's manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Licensee will at all times be subject to control, management and direction of the Licensor's manager and shall at all times obey his direction or directions of someone authorised by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The licensee whilst in occupation shall not carry on any illegal, offensive or hazardous trade or occupation nor engage in any activity which would be detrimental to the reputation of the markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Licensee will operate within the area provided and not encroach outside the bounds of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Licensee will not transfer his interest under this agreement without the consent of the Licensor first hand and obtained which consent may be granted on the condition that the Licensee pays to the Licensor a sum designated by the Licensor of total sale price received by the Licensee for the sale of his interest under this agreement and the goodwill of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Licensee shall have the right to occupy the stall on Saturday/Sunday of each week after the signing of this agreement upon payment of the License fee subject to the Licensor's right to cancel this agreement at any time and the Licensor shall not be required to provide any reason for the cancellation nor should the Licensee have any recourse against the Licensor arising from the cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Licensee should not bring in a vehicle to clear the contents of the stall before 2.45pm on Saturday and 3.45pm Sunday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Licensee and any staff employed will park in the designated car park and not in the customer car park, and shall ensure that the motor cars are parked in such position and will not block access to, egress from or interfere with traffic flow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify the Licensor in respect of all or any actions arising from or as a result of the Licensee and or its agent's conduct, performance or other actions arising from its occupation of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Failure to comply with all these conditions may result in the "License to Occupy" being cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 

8 Should a permanent stallholder propose to transfer his or her interest in a stall he or she must list it with Toea and introduce any prospective buyer to Mr Rosenlund so that he may assess that person's suitability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">A relevant consideration is the general category of product or service which the proposed transferee will sell or provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Toea seeks to ensure that the Market maintains an appropriate spread of categories of products and services, and that stalls offering like products are not located in close proximity to one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Permanent stalls "sell" for between $20 000 and $40 000, excluding stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Toea receives 10 per cent commission on such sale prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Businesses conducted from permanent stalls have sold for as much as $400 000, including the stall, improvements, fixtures and fittings and goodwill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">9 Approximately 20 stalls are occupied by long-term casual stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">These people have been operating from the Market for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Each is allocated the same stall on each weekend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">They are not required to book stalls during the preceding week, nor queue at the office on Saturday mornings to be allotted stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This right to a specific stall is not assignable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Long-term casual stallholders may be permitted to erect permanent signage and structures on their sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Since mid-2004 no new arrangements of this kind have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The change in policy was the result of discontent amongst permanent stallholders over the preferential arrangements made for long-term casual stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Stalls already allocated to existing long-term casual stallholders remain so allocated but, when such a stallholder leaves the Market, the stall goes back into the pool of stalls available for casual occupation, or it is "sold" as a permanent stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">10 Each weekend, other (non-long-term) casual stallholders occupy about 40 stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The number varies from week to week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Stalls may be booked on Tuesday morning for the following weekend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Casual stallholders do not enter into a licence to occupy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">They arrive between 5.00 am and 7.00 am on Saturday mornings and queue at the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">They are asked about the types of goods which they propose to sell and are then allocated stalls, depending upon availability and product type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Rosenlund tries to separate stallholders selling similar products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Potential casual stallholders are told that they cannot sell anything which is illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">On the first few occasions on which they rent stalls, casual stallholders are given copies of a slip entitled 'Conditions of Renting a Stall' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The document is also available on the Market website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It is exhibit JMR 4 to Mr Rosenlund's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">There is nothing of particular relevance in the conditions save that stallholders are obliged to accept five and ten dollar vouchers issued by Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The vouchers are redeemable by stallholders at the Market office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Mr Rosenlund claims that it is not practicable for him or his staff to check every individual item to be offered by the 40 casual stallholders each week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Exhibit JMR 5 is an information brochure provided to persons who enquire concerning the hiring of stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Attached to it is a document entitled 'Carrara Markets Casual Stall Policy' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The only relevant provision seems to be that:
 
 'Products not described to the Booking Officer at the time of booking may not be allowed to be sold on the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">' 
 

11 Stallholders pay a levy to cover public liability insurance, presumably effected by Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Stallholders are responsible for the tidiness of their own stall areas, but Toea is responsible for all common areas, including car parks and toilets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">There is a manager's office where stallholders attend to pay rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It also serves as an information centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">12 Some stallholders sell secondhand goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">During the relevant period, Toea held a licence which covered stallholders selling secondhand goods, provided that they did not do so on more than three occasions in any one year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Toea receives no commission upon sales effected at the Market by stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Its only revenue is rent and commission received on the sale of stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">13 On each weekend eighteen to twenty-three thousand customers attend the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Sunday is the busier day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Market is at its busiest in winter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Mr Rosenlund has about fourteen staff in attendance each weekend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">One is a full-time employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">There are three part-time office personnel, six part-time car parking attendants and two part-time employees who attend to general duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">14 Security guards are employed by Security and Traffic Management Pty Ltd, trading as Guardrite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Toea is invoiced each week for their services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">On Saturdays there are two security guards, one working from 8.30 am to 2.00 pm at the main gate and assisting in traffic control, and one working from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm on general security duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Those duties include patrolling, dealing with lost children, lost property, theft, accidents, sickness and otherwise identifying and dealing with problems around the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">All have first-aid certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">On Sundays three security guards are retained, one working from 8.30 am to 2.00 pm on the main gate, one working on general duties from 7.00 am to 4.00 pm and one working on general duties from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">A security guard patrols the Market from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm on Mondays to Fridays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Mr Rosenlund issues instructions to the security guards as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">15 In late 2002 or 2003 Mr Rosenlund was informed by investigators acting on behalf of the owners of trademarks that there had been an increase in the sale of allegedly counterfeit goods at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">As a result he instructed security guards to advise him if they saw any goods which appeared to be counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">However none of those guards had any training or specific knowledge in performing this task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">On a few occasions security guards informed Mr Rosenlund that they had seen goods which were obviously counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">On each occasion Mr Rosenlund went to the stall and confronted the stallholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">On one occasion the stallholder asserted that he had a certificate of authenticity for the item.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It did not appear to be an item produced or marketed by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">16 Mr Rosenlund's duties include hiring and supervising of staff, liaison with stallholders and customers and taking day-to-day decisions concerning the operation of the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Various issues arise in the course of such operation, particularly over weekends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It is necessary to ensure that the ATM machine is operational.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Parking, including vehicle security, is a major ongoing problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It is also necessary to deal with urgent health problems, difficulties with the toilet facilities, shoplifting and disputes between customers and stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The Market operates a website which is exhibit JMR 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The following statement now appears at the end of a passage headed 'Casual Stall Information' :
 
 'NB: Copyright Infringement Policy 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Carrara Markets does not condone the sale of products identified as infringing Australian copyright and/or Trademark laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It is your responsibility to ensure your products do not infringe Australian copyright and/or Trademark laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Carrara Markets reserves the right to take immediate action to exclude products identified to us as infringing these laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">' 
 
 

17 There is no evidence as to when this note was first published on the website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">18 In the course of cross-examination Mr Rosenlund said that in the 2004/2005 financial year Toea derived about $200 000 from commission on the sale of permanent stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">That was about 10 per cent of Toea's total revenue in that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">This figure was atypical, being inflated by one major sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">He also said that he tries to ensure that the Market is attractive to potential customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">This involves making sure that parking arrangements are satisfactory, that there is bus transport to and from the Market and that entertainment is available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Promotional vouchers are also issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Mr Rosenlund agreed that the restriction on the sale of products by casual stallholders, other than those identified to the booking officer, was designed to assist in ensuring a good mix of products for sale rather than to detect and prevent the sale of counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He is more concerned about the sale of products that bear a false trademark than about the sale of goods which appear to be the imitations but do not bear any trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This evidence related particularly to the operation at the Market of a stall selling sunglasses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It has a sign describing its stock as 'Looks the same without the name' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Mr Rosenlund did not consider this to be illegal conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He said that if he perceived that any stallholder was selling counterfeit goods he would tell that person to get rid of them or not to return to the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Such persons are often casual stallholders who do not return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He agreed that some people went to markets for the purpose of obtaining low-priced copies of designer goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">However he did not consider that those people formed a significant revenue source for the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The rest of Mr Rosenlund's evidence will be best dealt with elsewhere in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">OFFENDING STALLHOLDERS 
 
19 Although the applicant's case is pleaded widely, at the trial, it focused on a number of trap purchase to three stallholders, Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Most of the evidence concerned such purchases and observations made by private inquiry agents retained by the applicant to investigate possible infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mr Alcock 
 Purchase of one handbag on 6 April 2003 
 
20 This sale is not pleaded in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Mr Edmonds is a private enquiry agent, working under sub-contract to another agent, Ken Taylor, of Mainpack Pty Ltd. Mr Taylor had, on 2 March 2003, visited Mr Alcock's stall and there seen two medium-sized and one small "Epi" style bag bearing the applicant's "LV" trademark, or a mark similar to it, and two other bags bearing such marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">At Mr Taylor's request Mr Edmonds attended at the Market on 6 April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Mr Taylor was also present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">At Mr Alcock's stall Mr Edmonds saw two "Epi" style handbags bearing the applicant's "LV" and "Louis Vuitton" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">A sign indicated that one of the handbags was marked down from $110 to $90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Mr Edmonds indicated to a woman working at the stall that he wished to buy the handbag priced at $90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">He paid cash for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It bore a "swing tag" which bore the LV and Louis Vuitton trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">21 After Mr Edmond's purchase on 6 April 2003 Mr Taylor spoke to Mr Alcock and gave him a "warning letter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Mr Alcock said that:
 
 'I do not have any Louis Vuitton products because they stopped me three weeks ago when I spoke to your investigator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I will ring the Corrs lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">' 
 

22 The warning letter was headed 'Notice in relation to vending of counterfeit items' and bore a solicitor's logo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It read as follows:
 
 'You have just sold goods which bear one or more trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton Malletier SA ( "Louis Vuitton" ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">A schedule of these trade marks is attached to this notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">
 
 The goods sold by you are counterfeit and were not manufactured by or with the licence of Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The sale of counterfeit goods is illegal and can result in criminal and civil liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">You are exposed to the risk of prosecution or may be sued by Louis Vuitton seeking remedies such as injunctions, damages, account of profits and delivery up of stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">
 
 Unless you immediately cease the sale of goods bearing trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton, court action will be taken against you without further notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">
 
 This notice is effective immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">' 
 

23 Mr Alcock is a long-term casual stallholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">In his evidence he claimed to have bought 40 bags from a person called "Boris", intending to sell them pursuant to a 'party plan system' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">That system involves sales at social functions specifically organized for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He said that he was not aware of the significance of the "LV" logo or that it represented the name "Louis Vuitton".</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">He was also not aware that Louis Vuitton only sold through its own outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He had no reason to believe that the bags were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">He was unable to sell the bags by party-plan because they were too expensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">He therefore decided to sell them at the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He does not normally sell handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">24 He said in evidence that when Mr Taylor approached him on 6 April 2003 he said that he did not have any counterfeit Lous Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">He otherwise denied the statement attributed to him by Mr Taylor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He said that Mr Taylor said that the bags were illegal but that if he got rid of them it would be 'Okay' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Mr Taylor also suggested that he speak to someone 'at Louis Vuitton' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Mr Alcock later telephoned the relevant solicitors and said that he would not sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Purchase of one purse on 21 December 2003 
 
25 On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor saw ten handbags and two "Multicolore" wallets or copies thereof at the Alcock stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">"Multicolore" is a term used to describe one of the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The handbags bore the initials "JB" as well as a number of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or marks similar thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">He asked Mr Moes, also a private enquiry agent, to visit the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">26 At Mr Alcock's stall Mr Moes saw a girl, about fifteen years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">He did not see any products bearing the applicant's trademark or any similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">He asked the girl whether or not she had any 'Louis Vuitton bags or items' for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">She said that she did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">He then saw a man arrive at the stall and commence unpacking a box, taking out about fifteen bags and purses, each of which bore one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">He said to the man, 'They look good' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The man said, 'These bags are not real Louis Vuitton bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">They're imitation bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">' Mr Moes then purchased a brown purse which bore one or other of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks, paying $29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">He asked for a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The girl said that they did not give receipts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Purchase of one wallet on 11 January 2004 
 
27 On 11 January 2004 Huong Nguyen, a private investigation agent, visited the Market in company with Mr Taylor and Mr Moes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Ms Nguyen went to Mr Alcock's stall and spoke to a woman called Hope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">She saw five brown handbags, four brown wallets and one pink wallet, each of which bore one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks, and the letters "IX".</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Ms Nguyen approached Hope, asking the price of the 'Louis Vuitton handbags and wallets' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Hope said that the Louis Vuitton handbags were $49 each and the Louis Vuitton wallets, $29 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Ms Nguyen selected one wallet and paid $29 cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">She asked for a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Hope said that she had never written a receipt before, and that this was the first time anybody had asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">In the end a receipt was produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">28 Mr Moes was in the vicinity, taking photographs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">He said that he saw about ten handbags and wallets bearing the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He took photographs of Ms Nguyen speaking to Hope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">A complaint 
 
29 In January 2004 Mr Alcock's alleged infringements were brought to the attention of Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In February 2004 Mr Roselund spoke to him, saying that he had been 'caught selling fake Louis Vuitton bags' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">He was shown a letter from the applicant's solicitors and various photographs and was then given a notice of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Mr Alcock protested that he was not selling Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Mr Rosenlund then drew his attention to certain items on the stall asking, 'What are these then?</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Mr Alcock said that they were not Louis Vuitton bags and that he did not claim that they were, pointing to the "IX" logo and saying 'They have IX on them, they're not Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">' Mr Rosenlund said 'We're getting flack over them anyway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">' Mr Alcock protested that everyone was selling them and that they could buy them from shops in the Robina Shopping Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Mr Rosenlund said 'Look, the Louis Vuitton people have a problem, so I have a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">I wouldn't know if they're legal or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Just get rid of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">You can't sell them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">That's all there is to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">' Mr Alcock said that he would get rid of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Purchase of one bag on 15 February 2004 
 
30 On 15 February 2004 Mr Moes visited Mr Alcock's stall and saw Mr Rosenlund speaking to Mr Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">This appears to have been the conversation described in the preceding paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">He saw three bags on the stall, each of which bore one of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Each bore a price tag showing the price as $39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Mr Moes took one of the bags to a woman who was working on the stall and purchased it, paying cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The woman did not have the correct change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">She went to Mr Alcock and asked him for some change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">At the time she was holding the bag which Mr Moes had purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Mr Moes heard Mr Alcock say to Mr Rosenlund:
 
 'There you go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">That's another one sold, I only have two out for sale now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">' 
 

31 Mr Rosenlund then left the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The woman gave Mr Moes his change and the bag but declined to give him a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">32 A little later Mr Moes saw Mr Rosenlund carrying a folder in which was a document headed 'Corrs Chambers Westgarth' , the name of the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">He gave Mr Rosenlund a "letter of demand".</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Mr Rosenlund told him that he was, at that time, seeing the store operators, presumably in connection with previous correspondence received from the solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Mr Moes said:
 
 'I will be furnishing a report to Corrs Chambers Westgarth on stall holders who are selling counterfeit Louis Vuitton merchandise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">It would be in your best interests to contact Corrs Chambers Westgarth in relation to the matter as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">' 
 
 Purchase of one scarf on 12 December 2004 
 
33 On 12 December 2004, at the request of Mr Taylor, Ms Crystal Taylor, also a private enquiry agent, attended the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">She went to Mr Alcock's stall and there saw, in a glass display case, a scarf bearing one of the applicant's trademarks, or a similar mark, and on a bench, two white handbags, each of which bore one or other of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">She spoke to a woman called Samantha who was working in the stall, asking, 'Do you have any Louis Vuitton bags at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">I see you have the scarf and other brands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">' The woman said, 'Yes we do, but just wait a moment while I check with my husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">' 
 
34 The woman then spoke to a man at the stall whom Ms Taylor subsequently identified as Mr Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">She heard him say, 'Be careful of this stuff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">' He seemed to be annoyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">He unlocked a glass cabinet and took out the scarf bearing the applicant's trademark and relocked the cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Ms Taylor noticed that there was an identical scarf underneath the scarf which he had removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">She asked the woman for the price of the scarf and was told that it was $39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">She purchased it, paying cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">At the time Ms Taylor heard Mr Alcock say to the woman, 'Hide these boxes, would you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">' She was not shown any bags and was not offered a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Purchase of one watch and one hair clip on 24 April 2005 
 
35 On 24 April 2005 Ms Nguyen again went to the Alcock stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">At the rear of the stall she saw a lady's wristwatch which bore the applicant's "LV", "Louis Vuitton" and "flower" trademarks or marks similar to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">She saw a woman with short, curly, blond hair serving customers and asked if she could look at the Louis Vuitton watch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The woman said that it was her last 'Louis Vuitton watch' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Ms Nguyen purchased the watch and a hair clip, paying $70 in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">She received $2 change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">She asked for a receipt, but the woman said that she did not have a receipt book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Ms Nguyen said that a piece of paper would be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">She did not receive any receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Confrontation --- Mr Edmondson 
 
36 On or about 7 May 2005 a Market employee, David Edmondson, called on Mr Alcock and showed him a letter from Corrs Chambers Westgarth in which it was alleged that on 24 April 2005, a lady's wristwatch and other items which infringed the applicant's trademarks had been seen on his stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Mr Edmondson told him to withdraw any such infringing products from the Market and never to sell such products again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Mr Edmondson said that Mr Rosenlund had asked him to remind Mr Alcock that the selling of counterfeit goods might affect his future ability to occupy a stall and that his stall at the Market was at stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Mr Alcock assured Mr Edmondson that he had no Louis Vuitton products, and that he would not, in the future, sell any such goods or anything like them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Confrontation --- Mr Rosenlund 
 
37 On 15 May 2005 Mr Rosenlund spoke to Mr Alcock at his stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">He referred to the earlier conversation with Mr Edmondson and said:
 
 'I'm really upset at you for putting the Market and me in a position where it might appear that we are allowing you to sell these fake Louis Vuitton goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">You gave me an assurance that this would not happen again and I believed you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">' 
 

38 Mr Alcock said:
 
 'I'm sorry John, it was a mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">I didn't even know that the watch was there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">I bought a box of stock from a woman who was closing her shop at Robina Shopping Centre, and I didn't realise that the Louis Vuitton watch was in the box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">One of the girls unpacked the box and everything was put in a cabinet at the back of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">I didn't even see the watch and my wife sold it to a woman she said was very persistent and specifically wanted to buy that particular watch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">' 
 

39 Mr Rosenlund said:
 
 'It's just not good enough, Gary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Any future problems and you will definitely be thrown out of the Market for good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">' 
 

40 Mr Alcock said:
 
 'Look John, if you want I'll give you a Stat Dec outlining what happened so that you and the Market don't get into trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">' 
 

41 Mr Rosenlund said that this might help.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Mr Alcock then said:
 
 'I absolutely assure you that I won't sell anything else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">This will never happen again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">' 
 

42 On 6 June 2005, Mr Alcock executed a statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">In it he declared that:
 
 '... sometime in the year 2004 the management of Carrara Markets instructed all stall holders that they were not to infringe on the trade marks of Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">To this end I changed the way I purchased goods for resale and restricted my purchases to goods which were either authenticated by the seller or came from a recognized retail outlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Again in March 2005 the Carrara Markets management strongly instructed stall holders that they were not to infringe the Louis Vuitton trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Even though I was able to purchase items from a nationally advertised retail source, which came with certificates of authentication backed by a money back guarantee, the market enforced their "NO Louis Vuitton" and I agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">
 
 On the 17 th of April 2005 I purchased a number of fashion watches from a retail outlet on the Gold Coast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">These watches were purchased for resale at the market and to my knowledge did not contain any Louis Vuitton items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">All these watches were placed at the back of the stall in a cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">
 
 On the 24 th of April my wife, who was looking after the stall was approached by a woman who was desperate to buy anything "Louis Vuitton".</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">My wife explained that we did not sell Louis Vuitton but the woman would not take no for an answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The woman then searched through the cabinet at the back of the stall and asked my wife if she could buy the watch which I now know to be the one in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">As I was operating another stall which occupied all my time, I was not aware that the item had found its way into my stock or that the transaction had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">
 
 It is my contention that the Carrara Markets management not only had no idea that this transaction had taken place, but, because neither the stall holders or market management could differentiate between authentic or counterfeit items, they were actively enforcing a ban on the sale of any Louis Vuitton items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">' 
 

43 In July 2005 Mr Alcock received a memorandum dated 31 July 2005 from the Market outlining its policy in relation to counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It is exhibit GJA 7 to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">It states:
 
 'Carrara Markets are currently in Federal Court proceedings with solicitors representing Louis Vuitton as a result of stallholders here selling copy Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 The facts are Trade Mark Investigation Services (TMIS) and Anti Counterfeiting Action Group (ACAG) are more active than ever in seeking to prevent the sale of counterfeit goods from markets in particular and have proven willing to prosecute as a result of their investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">They continually send investigators under cover to seek out and purchase counterfeit goods and usually take photos etc as evidence of their ability to purchase these goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">This evidence will be used to support court action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">
 
 It is Carrara Markets policy to co-operate with these groups and it is also our policy that the sale of illegal and counterfeit goods identified cannot be sold at our markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Stallholders blatantly ignoring these policies or repeat offenders jeopardize their "Licence to Occupy" and run the risk of losing their stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 Attached for your information is a recent article from the Sun Herald concerning action taken at Parklea Markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">
 
 Would you please ensure you and your staff are aware of the policies and that counterfeit goods are not sold at your store.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">
 
 We thank you in advance for your co-operation in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">' 
 

44 The letter was signed by Mr Rosenlund as manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Attached was a newspaper clipping referring to a police raid on a market in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Linda Byrne 
 Purchase of one handbag on 6 April 2003 
 
45 Ms Byrne is a permanent stallholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">On 6 April 2003 Mr Edmonds visited Ms Byrne's stall where Ms Byrne introduced herself as Linda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">There were two bags on display, each bearing one of the applicant's trademarks or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Ms Byrne said to him:
 
 'My daughter supplies me with all my designer stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">My daughter also holds a Louis Vuitton sales party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">She lives in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">' 
 

46 Mr Edmonds purchased one of the handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Ms Byrne provided a dust bag in which to carry the handbag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">The dust bag also bore one of the applicant's trademarks or a similar mark.</sentence>

47 Ms Nguyen visited Ms Byrne's stall on 11 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">She spoke to a woman called Evangeline Balibay who asked her if she wanted Gucci bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Ms Nguyen replied, 'Do you have any Louis?</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">' Evangeline indicated to a younger woman that she should bring out a handbag stored in a blue, white and red carry bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The handbag bore one or other of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or a similar mark and the initials "IX".</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Ms Balibay said that it was the last Louis Vuitton handbag, and that Ms Nguyen could have it for $60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">She appeared to be nervous and quickly returned the bag to the storage bag, saying, 'I have to hide it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">' Ms Nguyen did not buy anything at that stage but returned to the stall later in the day and again spoke to Ms Balibay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">She asked if she could purchase the Louis Vuitton handbag which she had seen earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Evangeline produced the handbag and Ms Nguyen paid $60 for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">She asked for a receipt but was told that there would be 'No receipt' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Ms Nguyen said that she was buying the bag as a gift for her mother and that she and her sister were going to split the cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Evangeline then wrote the words and figures 'Bag $60' on a business card and gave it to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The card bore the words: 'Evangeline Balibay Director' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Purchase of one purse on 12 December 2004 
 
48 On 12 December 2004, Ms Crystal Taylor went to the Byrne stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">She saw a woman who appeared to be between 45 and 50 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Ms Taylor introduced herself as "Emily".</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The woman said that her name was Linda Byrne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Ms Taylor asked if she had any Louis Vuitton stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Ms Byrne led her to the back of the stall where, hanging on the wall, was a large garment resembling a raincoat, behind which were two large garbage bin liners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Ms Byrne produced two handbags from one of the bags, each of which bore one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">One bag was white and the other, black.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Ms Byrne said that they were each priced at $170.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">49 Ms Byrne also showed Ms Taylor two purses, both of which bore the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">One purse was brown the other pink with a cherry blossom pattern on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Ms Byrne said that the purses were each priced at $120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Ms Byrne then went to the other garbage bag liner, which was blue in colour, and produced a multi-coloured handbag which bore one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Ms Byrne said that this was priced at $250 but was 'on hold' for another customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Ms Taylor asked Ms Byrne to write down the prices of the handbags and purses and her telephone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">She did this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Ms Taylor asked if she could ring later in the day to see if the handbag priced at $250 was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Ms Byrne agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Ms Taylor again asked her name and Ms Byrne wrote 'Linda Byrne' on the paper on which she had written the prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Ms Taylor then left the stall and went to speak to Mr Taylor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">A little later she returned to the stall and purchased a brown purse bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark for $120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">She did not get a receipt.</sentence>

50 On 8 May 2005 Ms Taylor went to the Byrne stall where she saw Ms Byrne.</sentence>

<sentence id="s362">I'm looking for something very special for my mum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">' Ms Byrne pointed to some shirts which bore the Ralph Lauren "Polo" brand, saying that they were $25 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Ms Taylor said 'Yeah, but I'm looking for something special though.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">I don't know if you remember me but I was here at Christmas time and you had some special purses that I bought for my sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">' Ms Byrne said 'How about Louis Vuitton?</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">' Ms Taylor said 'Yes, that's great.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">I bought for my sister a Louis Vuitton purse last time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">My Mum really liked it and she got a bit jealous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">So today I wanted to get something special for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">' Ms Byrne said 'Come with me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">' They walked behind a clothes rack in the stall, and Ms Byrne opened a beach bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">She took out a small purse which bore the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark and said, 'Now this is Louis Vuitton, it's very nice, it is $80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">' Ms Taylor asked if she had any other purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Ms Byrne produced two purses, each bearing such a monogram and said that they were priced at $120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Ms Taylor asked about a purse in a dust bag and was told that it was priced at $150.</sentence>

<sentence id="s378">She also said:
 
 'You know it's very hard to sell Louis Vuitton any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Not many people sell Louis Vuitton any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">There is a Louis Vuitton inspector up here and he looks out for Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">He told me not to sell any more otherwise I get fined from Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">' 
 

51 Ms Taylor responded 'Well, I'll buy this, it's pretty cheap for Louis Vuitton, $80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">' She paid $80 in cash and Ms Byrne put the purse in a brown cardboard box also bearing the words 'Louis Vuitton' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Ms Byrne's evidence 
 
52 Ms Byrne said that she sold second-hand and new items from her stall, primarily clothing, bags and accessories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">On 14 or 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her at the stall, saying that she had been caught selling fake Louis Vuitton goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">She said that she had stocked Louis Vuitton bags 'a long time ago' but did not do so any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Mr Rosenlund showed her a letter which listed goods 'supposedly sold at my stall' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">He handed her a notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">He asked her to promise that she would not sell any fake goods again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">She said that she had not sold any fake goods 'or other stuff' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Mr Rosenlund showed her certain photographs which she said were not of her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">He said that he still wanted her to promise that she would not sell any fake bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">She agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Mr Rosenlund said that the photographs had been taken on 11 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Ms Byrne said that she had not traded at the stall on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">She was on holidays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The notice which he showed her was from Toea, addressed to stallholders at Carrara Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">It was headed 'Sale of Counterfeit Items Prohibited' and stated:
 
 'It has come to my attention that you are selling counterfeit items at Carrara Market bearing trademarks owned by Louis Vuitton Malletier SA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">
 
 You are hereby notified that the sale of counterfeit items is illegal and prohibited.</sentence>

<sentence id="s402">If you have any questions, please see me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">' 
 

53 On 21 September 2004 Mr Rosenlund gave Ms Byrne a newsletter dated 21 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">It was headed 'Copyright Infringements' and was signed by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It stated:
 
 'A new government organization has been established in 2004 to combat copyright theft with relation to the motion picture and television industry (see attached).</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The new Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft Organization is very active in this area and detection can carry huge fines and gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Copyright infringements are not only illegal, but reflect badly on any establishment allowing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">
 
 Any illegal trading at Carrara Markets is not only contrary to the law, but is also contrary to Carrara Markets "Licence to Occupy" agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Management will do whatever is necessary to ensure our business is not subject to law infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">
 
 Please be aware of, and report to management, any traders involving themselves in these types of activities, their business may be at stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">' 
 

54 In June or July 2005 Mr Rosenlund again spoke to Ms Byrne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">He said that he had discovered that she had again been selling Louis Vuitton counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">She denied this allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">He said that she should make sure that she never again had anything resembling a Louis Vuitton product at the stall or she would be at risk of losing the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">He said that he had decided to ban Louis Vuitton products from being sold in the Market, whether they were originals or copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">She said that she would not sell Louis Vuitton products again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">55 In July 2005 Mr Rosenlund came to the stall and gave her a Carrara Markets memorandum dated 31 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">I have previously set out the content of the relevant newsletter in connection with the case concerning Mr Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">It is exhibit GJA 7 to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">56 Ms Byrne said that when she first sold items bearing the Louis Vuitton logo she was unaware that it was illegal to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">She had seen the items sold in shops and by 'many people' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">She now understands that it is illegal to sell counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Her new understanding has been derived from information supplied by Mr Rosenlund and from the various notices and newsletters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Ruth Gallop 
 Purchase of one handbag on 21 December 2003 
 
57 On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor attended the Market and went to the Gallop stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">He there saw a grey-haired lady of thin build who, he thought, was about 58-60 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">I infer that this was Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">He saw a large travel bag and a scarf, each of which bore the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">He saw Ms Gallop sell two scarves and five or six cherry blossom handbags and wallets, each bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">He heard the woman say to one of the customers:
 
 'Like I mean, why would you pay that kind of money when the copies are so good?</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">' 
 

58 Mr Taylor left the stall and returned some time later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">He heard a female customer inquire of Ms Gallop whether she had any Louis Vuitton men's wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">She replied 'Look, they are just so hard to get.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">You bring in four boxes of them and Customs get two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">' The customer then left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">59 Mr Taylor saw a brown handbag bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">He pointed to the handbag and asked Ms Gallop whether she had a wallet in the same brown colour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">She said 'Look I've got some more hidden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The inspector has been around and they'll fine you up to $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">It's highly illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Come over here, and I'll show you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">' 
 
60 Mr Taylor followed her to the next stall where another woman handed her two small handbags, both bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Ms Gallop showed the handbags to Mr Taylor and said that one was priced at $180 and the other at $125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">He asked her as to the quality of the handbag priced at $125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">She said 'It's so good it's grade B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">' He purchased the handbag and paid $125 in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">He asked for a receipt and the operator said 'I'm sorry love, it's highly illegal.</sentence>

61 At the rear of the stall he saw two "Multicolore" wallets, three scarves and three small handbags, each bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">They were on a shelf beneath the counter and were not visible to him when he stood at the front of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Purchase of one scarf on 11 January 2004 
 
62 On 11 January 2004 Ms Nguyen visited the Gallop stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The woman operating the stall appeared to be in her late 50's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">She identified herself as "Ruth".</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">I infer that it was Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Ms Nguyen saw one large bag, one brown scarf and one black "Multicolore" scarf, all bearing one of the applicant's trademarks or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Ms Nguyen asked Ms Gallop whether she had any wallets or handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The woman then produced a medium sized handbag from under the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">It bore a Louis Vuitton trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Ruth said, 'Only this one left, you know it's very hard to get and I keep it under here because it's highly illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">They have inspectors come round you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">' She said that the purchase price was $160 and that it was expensive because it was a new design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The brown 'monogram' design was always cheaper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">She then said, 'I'm selling these for people from Sydney, it's so hard to get now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">They x-ray everything at the airport, you can't even get one bag in now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">These are dinkies but this one is a copy because it has the lines across the fabric.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">' Ms Nguyen asked the cost of Louis Vuitton scarves and was told that they were $35 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Ruth said that apart from the products on display, she had no more Louis Vuitton stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Ms Nguyen left the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">63 Later, Ms Nguyen returned to the Gallop stall and purchased the black "Multicolore" scarf which she had seen previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">It bore the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">She paid $35 in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The woman said, 'This is a dinkem one for you'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Ms Nguyen said, 'So is it genuine?</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">' Ruth replied, 'Well, I'm not allowed to say that because it's not from the shop you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">But genuine to you okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The brown Monogram scarf is a copy because there are lines across the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">' 
 
64 Ms Nguyen asked for a receipt but was told, 'Nobody records things at the markets, people with warehouses will give you a receipt but I don't have any.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">' 
 Purchase of one scarf on 15 February 2004 
 
65 On 11 January 2004 Mr Moes had seen Ms Nguyen purchase a scarf at the Gallop stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">On 15 February 2004 he again visited the Gallop stall and saw a woman whom he knew as Ruth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">I infer that the woman was Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">On this occasion three bags and three scarves were displayed on the counter, each bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Each was contained in a separate "Glad" zip lock bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">He saw Mr Rosenlund arrive at the stall and speak to Ruth but did not hear their conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">He then asked Ms Gallop, 'How much are the Louis Vuitton bags?</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">' Ms Gallop replied that they were $120 each and that the scarves were $35 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">She then said:
 
 'I shouldn't be selling the Louis Vuitton bags or scarves because they are fakes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">The markets may get closed down if I sell those products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The man that I was just talking to was the market manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">He told me not to get caught selling any fake merchandise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">I told him that I would keep the merchandise under the counter and only sell it to people that ask for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">' 
 

66 This evidence was not led as truth of the contents of the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">67 Mr Moes then purchased a scarf bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark and paid $35 in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Ms Gallop declined to give him a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Purchase of one scarf on 24 April 2005 
 
68 On 24 April 2005 Ms Nguyen again visited Ms Gallop's stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">She saw one black "Epi" style wallet bearing the "LV" trademark or similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">The wallet was not clearly displayed, being partially hidden by two "Gucci" leather wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Ms Nguyen picked up the "Epi" style wallet and asked the price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Ms Gallop said that it was $75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">She appeared to be uncomfortable that Ms Nguyen was holding the wallet openly in public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">She then said, 'This is a Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">It is illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">I can't get them anymore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">' She also said, 'I've got another one, but it's cheap, it's grey, not as good quality as that one (indicating the black "Epi" wallet).</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">You won't like it, you look fussy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">' Ms Nguyen replied, 'That's alright, just show me anyway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">' 
 
69 Ms Gallop went behind the table and, from a plastic bag, took out a grey "Vernis" men's wallet bearing the "LV" trademark and one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">She said that the price was $25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Ms Nguyen compared the two and said that she would purchase the Louis Vuitton "Epi" wallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">She paid $75 for it but did not receive a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">70 Thereafter, Ms Gallop and Ms Nguyen had a general conversation during which Ms Nguyen said, 'I think I've bought stuff from you before, but I haven't been to the markets in ages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">It's Ruth isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">' 
 
71 Ms Gallop replied 'Yes, I think I remember you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">It was ages ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">' As she was about to leave, Ms Gallop said to Ms Nguyen:
 
 'Let me know if you want anything else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">I could tell you who you can get it from, you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">' 
 
 Purchase of one wallet on 8 May 2005 
 
72 On 8 May 2005 Ms Crystal Taylor went to the Gallop stall where she spoke to Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">She saw various items bearing brand names and asked Ms Gallop if she had other brands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Ms Gallop said, 'Well I used to sell Louis Vuitton, but it is not worth it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">This Gucci wallet is much better quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">' Ms Taylor then said, 'So you haven't got any Louis Vuitton at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">' Ms Gallop replied, 'You know, I don't sell it any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">' Ms Taylor said, 'I was just looking for a lovely gift for my Mum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">She has got a Louis Vuitton bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">I was hoping you would have something like a purse to match.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">' Ms Gallop said, 'Well I have only a Louis Vuitton men's wallet, and they are not for ladies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">' Ms Taylor said, 'Well, can I have a look at one?</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">' and Ruth said, 'Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Come with me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">' They went behind the counter and Ms Taylor there saw Ms Gallop open a sliding door in a wooden cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">There were about seven items in the cabinet, each separately wrapped in yellow paper bearing the applicant's "LV" and "Louis Vuitton" trademarks or similar marks with a layer of clear plastic wrapped around it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Ms Gallop removed an item and unwrapped it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">It was a wallet bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">She said, 'Now I don't like selling these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">They get me into so much trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">They're just not worth it at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">They're copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">You know I've got fined for these before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">They're the last ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">There was this one Asian lady who was very nice and she insisted "LV" , like you, and I sold it to her and I was photographed and sued for so much money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">You know, about $450,000 for one wallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">She doesn't know how much it affects people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">But if your mum has a bag, this should be a good gift for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">' 
 
73 Ms Taylor said, 'Yes that's nice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">That's just like her bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">How much are they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">' Ms Gallop said, 'They're $85.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">' Ms Taylor said, 'Well that's a good deal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">I'll get one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">' Ms Gallop said, 'Okay, well here it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">' Ms Taylor said, 'Thanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">' Ms Gallop then enquired whether she might be interested in 'another Louis Vuitton gift '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">She produced two watches, both bearing the "LV" trademark or a similar mark and the applicant's "flower" mark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">One watch was blue and the other, brown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">She said, 'I've also got these lovely watches too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Both are Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">One is brown and one is blue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">They are $35 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">' Ms Taylor said, 'Okay, well I will just go and check my bank and if I have enough money I'll come back for one of the watches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">What was your name?</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">' Ms Gallop said, 'Ruth .</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Well I have taken a good look at you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">So I'll remember you if you want a watch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">' Ms Taylor said, 'Ok, Ruth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Thanks very much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">' The wallet was given to her in a dust bag which also bore the "LV" logo or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Ms Gallop's evidence 
 
74 In evidence, Ms Gallop said that she rented the stall on a casual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">She is considered to be a long-term stallholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">She is about 70 years of age and supplements her pension from the income from the stall, primarily selling clothing and accessories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">For the last few years she has sold mainly American Indian products: t-shirts, bandanas and wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">During her time at the Market, she had seen the documents entitled 'Carrara Market Stall Information' and 'Conditions of Renting a Stall' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">She could not remember when she received them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Those documents contain no particular reference to trading in illegal goods, although there is a statement that, 'Products not described to the booking officer at the time of booking may not be allowed to be sold on the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">' 
 
75 On 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her at her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">He said that she had been caught selling copies of Louis Vuitton goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">She said that she had no fake Louis Vuitton goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">He showed her some documents, including photographs of her at the stall, selling to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">He said that selling counterfeit goods at the Market was illegal and that she could not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">He then gave her a copy of a notice which he said had been sent to him by the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">He had been asked to pass it on to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">He asked her to read it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">She did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">He then asked for an assurance that she would not, again, sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products from her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">He said that he would be checking on her from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">He was forceful in his manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">He then said, 'Don't let us catch you again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">' She said that it wouldn't happen again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The documents which he showed to her contained details of trap purchases made on 21 December 2003 and 11 January 2004, together with photographs and a notice concerning the sale of counterfeit items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">On 21 September 2004, she received a newsletter bearing that date which referred to the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">76 On 7 or 8 May 2005 Mr Edmondson spoke to her, telling her about a letter which Mr Rosenlund had received from the solicitors for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">He showed her details of observations made of her stall on 24 April 2005 at which time one wallet was purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Mr Edmondson asked her to remove any products which infringed Louis Vuitton trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">He said that Mr Rosenlund wanted any illegal products to be removed from the Market site altogether, and that she could not sell those items at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">He said that the sale of counterfeit goods was against Market policy and that if she sold such goods, it would affect her ability to continue holding the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">77 On 15 May 2005 Mr Rosenlund spoke to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">He appeared angry and spoke harshly to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">He said that a Louis Vuitton investigator had caught her selling a fake Louis Vuitton wallet even after she had promised him that she would not deal in such products, and that he was disappointed with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">He said that the investigator had seen another fake Louis Vuitton wallet for sale on the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">Ms Gallop was embarrassed as she had previously told Mr Rosenlund that she would not sell those products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">She then swore that she would not, again, sell counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Mr Rosenlund said that if she did, he would see that she was thrown out of the Market for good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">78 On 31 July 2005 Mr Rosenlund again spoke to her, giving her a letter dated 28 July 2005 which he asked her to read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">The "letter" was the report of two investigators who had attended at her stall on 19 June 2005 and seen a Louis Vuitton bag there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">She said that this was the personal property of a lady called "Elizabeth" who had a stall behind her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">It was an original Louis Vuitton bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">The tag attached to it was a travel tag not a price tag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The letter also alleged that the private investigator had asked her about Louis Vuitton products and that she had replied: 'no, I'm all sold out sweetie, see me next time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">' Mr Gallop said this was just a 'throw away line' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">Mr Rosenlund forcefully told her to make sure that she never again had any counterfeit goods for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">79 In July 2005 a staff member from the Market gave her a copy of the newsletter dated 31 July which mentioned Federal Court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">In August 2005 she received a newsletter dated August 2005 which dealt with rental and other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">The only reference to goods being sold was to 'product additions' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">This seems to have referred to products the sale of which had not been previously approved by Market management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">OTHER TRAP PURCHASES 
 
80 Apart from the items already discussed, various other items were purchased from other stallholders at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">They and the relevant stalls are identified in pars 106 and 109 of the applicant's written submissions as follows: 
 
 &#8226; one brown Monogram canvas handbag --- purchased at Stall 54 ("Pam");
 &#8226; one pink cherry blossom wallet --- purchased from Irene, "Vaquer Qld Women's Fashions Queensland";
 &#8226; one pink cherry blossom cap - purchased from stall next to "Funky Fones" stall;
 &#8226; two black Multicolore mobile phone covers - purchased from "Funky Fones" stall;

 &#8226; one white mobile phone neck strap --- purchased from "Funky Fones" stall;
 &#8226; one mobile phone cover --- purchased from "Funky Fones" stall; and
 &#8226; one shoulder bag --- purchased from Barbara Maskiell's stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">
 IDENTIFICATION OF COUNTERFEIT GOODS 
 
81 Mr Bombardi or Mr Pichon are employees of the applicant, having specialist knowledge as to the manufacture and design of its products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">One or other of them examined each of the items purchased and concluded that all were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">I do not understand their opinions to be challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">I also do not understand there to be any challenge to the assertion that in those circumstances, each sale infringed one or more of the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">MR TAYLOR 
 
82 Mr Taylor seems to have been the applicant's principal investigating agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Prior to 2 March 2003 he had dealt with Mr Rosenlund concerning the sale of counterfeit sunglasses at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Mr Rosenlund appears to have been helpful to Mr Taylor in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">That is of no particular relevance for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Mr Taylor visited the Market on 2 March 2003 in order to detect any infringement of the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">He noticed goods bearing such trademarks or similar marks at the Alcock stall, the Byrne stall and a stall operated by Paul Osmond, a person with whom Mr Taylor had had dealings in connection with sunglasses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">On 6 April 2003 Mr Taylor attended at the Market with Mr Edmonds and made trap purchases at the Alcock and Byrne stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Mr Taylor served a warning notice on Mr Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">83 On 21 December 2003 Mr Taylor observed, at the Gallop stall, products on sale which appeared to bear the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">He saw a woman sell two scarves and five or six handbags and wallets bearing that mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">He heard the woman say to one of the customers, 'Like I mean, why would you pay that kind of money when the copies are so good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">' He also saw other goods bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">Later in the day he resumed his surveillance of the Gallop stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">His observations and actions have been set out in the section of these reasons dealing with Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">He also visited the Alcock stall where he saw various items on display which bore the applicant's trademarks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">He subsequently asked Mr Moes to visit the stall and make a trap purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">84 On 11 January 2004 Mr Taylor visited the Market with Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">He told them to undertake surveillance of stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">He waited outside the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">He subsequently met Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes and then visited various stalls at the Market to serve warning notices on behalf of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">He visited stall 54, which was next to the Gallop stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">He there saw two large "Multicolore" handbags bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Two women were operating the stall, one of whom had been at the Gallop stall on 21 December 2003, but was not the woman who had served him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">He served a letter on her, told her that it was illegal to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products, that she must cease selling and displaying those products immediately and contact the applicant's solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">She replied, 'Is that so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">I really didn't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">' 
 
85 Mr Taylor then went to the Gallop stall where he recognized the woman who had served him on the previous occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">I infer that this was Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">He saw a scarf bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">The woman tried to cover it with another product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">He gave her a letter concerning her alleged dealings in counterfeit Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">He also saw two small boxes behind the counter, each bearing the words "Louis Vuitton".</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">The woman said, 'I don't have anything else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">I only have this one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">I didn't sell any bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">' Mr Taylor said to her, 'Before Christmas you sold me a bag for $125 which is counterfeit, an illegal copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Now Louis Vuitton's lawyers will take action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">I suggest you respond to the warning letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">' He then left the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">86 On the same day he visited the Byrne stall where he saw two women who appeared to be of Philippine origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">He saw three cherry blossom clutch handbags and two monogram-style clutch handbags, each bearing one or more of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks, as well as the initials "IX".</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">He also saw a wallet which bore the applicant's "Damier" trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">He said to that woman, 'Are you Linda?</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">' The woman replied, 'No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">' The other woman working at the stall said 'Hello, I'm Eva.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">Linda is in the Philippines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">' He then said that counterfeit Louis Vuitton products were being sold from the stall and that this conduct infringed the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">He served a letter of demand on her and saw her remove the offending products and hide them from view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">87 On the same day Mr Taylor visited the Alcock stall where he saw on display three wallets, three cherry blossom-style bags and two handbags, each bearing one or other of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or similar marks and the initials "IX".</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">He handed a letter of demand to Mr Alcock who replied, 'They have "IX" not "LV".</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">Mr Taylor said, 'The products still bear marks that are individually registered as trademarks by Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">The four petal flower shown on your products is one of the trademarks individually registered by Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">' Mr Alcock replied, 'Let's trade, I know where you can get heaps of them, there's a shop full of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">' Mr Taylor said, 'I am in no position to do a deal with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">You have been caught and I suggest you call Kadri Elcoat at Corrs Chambers Westgarth and discuss it with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">' He then left the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">88 On the same day he went to stall 214 where he spoke to a woman called Irene Nazari.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">He saw a bag lying on the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">It bore the applicant's "flower" trademark or a similar mark as well as the initials "IX".</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">He served a warning notice on her and told her to contact the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">She gave him the Louis Vuitton bag displayed on the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">She also said that over Christmas, she had purchased two such bags and two wallets at the Melbourne markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">89 Mr Taylor next visited the Market on 17 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">At the Alcock stall he saw four wallets and four handbags bearing the applicant's "flower" trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">Mr Alcock appeared to recognize him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">Whilst Mr Taylor was looking at products bearing the applicant's trademark, Mr Alcock said, 'Well I have to sell them or I'll lose money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">' Mr Taylor then went to the Byrne stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">He did not see Linda Byrne, nor did he see any products which he regarded as infringing the applicant's trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">However, as it was raining, there was a plastic sheet covering part of the product display.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">He then went to the Gallop stall where he saw a cherry blossom-style handbag which bore one or other of the applicant's "flower" trademarks or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">It was about 30 cm in length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">90 Mr Taylor then went to the office, intending to speak to Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">He was told that he was not there or that he was unavailable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">Mr Taylor introduced himself to another man, saying that he was attending on behalf of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">He said that for over a year, there had been problems with stallholders selling counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">He also said that he had warned a number of stallholders and had served warning letters in the course of the preceding week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">The man replied, 'You didn't tell us you were here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">' Mr Taylor said, 'No, but today the lawyers have set everything out clearly so you can see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">' He then handed a letter and attachments to the man and asked that he pass them on to Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">The man said that he would do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Mr Taylor then said, 'If you want to see the problem I am happy to show you on stall 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">' The man said, 'I will pass it on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">' The letter was dated 15 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Mr Taylor said that he then saw Mr Rosenlund in an inner office and formed the impression that Mr Rosenlund had been listening to the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">91 Mr Taylor visited the Market again on 12 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">On this occasion he was accompanied by Ms Taylor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">He took Ms Taylor to the Byrne stall and told her to make a trap purchase of a product bearing the applicant's trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">He saw Ms Taylor speak to a woman at the stall whom he knew to be Linda Byrne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">They walked to the back of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">He was unable to see what happened thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">On the same day he took Ms Taylor to the Alcock stall and told her to make a trap purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">He subsequently met her in the car park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">92 On 24 April 2005 he visited the Market with Ms Nguyen and Mr Moes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">At about 11.30 am he went to the Alcock stall where he saw a blonde woman serving customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">He said, 'I have a letter from Louis Vuitton here, because there was a complaint that yesterday you displayed and sold counterfeit Louis Vuitton thongs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">' The lady replied, 'They weren't mine, they were someone else's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">I didn't want to sell them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">' Mr Taylor then said, 'You are Gary's wife aren't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">' , apparently referring to Mr Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">The woman replied, 'Yes' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">Mr Taylor then said, 'Gary knows about this, he has been warned before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">If you continue to sell these counterfeits, it will end up in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">' He then handed a warning letter to Ms Alcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">As he was leaving the stall Mr Alcock called to him from a nearby shoe stall, asking if he wanted to buy some shoes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">93 Later that day he went to the Gallop stall where he saw Ms Gallop and said to her, 'I have a warning letter here from Louis Vuitton in respect of counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">' She replied, 'I don't have any Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">' Mr Taylor said, 'You had a counterfeit Louis Vuitton Epi bag on display earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">' She said, 'No Louis Vuitton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">' He said, 'Epi, a black Epi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">' She said, 'What's Epi?</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">' Mr Taylor said, 'You should read this, you've been warned before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">' He then handed her the warning letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">94 At the next stall, "Funky Fones", he saw four telephone covers, each bearing the applicant's "LV" trademark and its "flower" trademark or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">He picked up one of these covers and took it to a man at the counter who was wearing a brown, bucket-shaped hat bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">He placed the cover on the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">The man said, 'Ten dollars' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">Mr Taylor said, 'I don't want to buy it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">I have a letter for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">It is illegal to sell Louis Vuitton copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">' The man said, 'I'm even wearing one on my head' and laughed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Mr Taylor said, 'Are you the boss?</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">' He replied, 'No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">' Mr Taylor said, 'What is your name?</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">' He said, 'Bill' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Mr Taylor handed him a warning notice saying, 'Give the letter to your boss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">' The man said, 'Yeah, ok.' 
 
95 Mr Taylor then went to an unnumbered stall next to the "Funky Fones" stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">He there saw two bucket-shaped hats on display, both bearing the applicant's monogram trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">He approached a Caucasian man who appeared to be operating the stall and handed him a warning letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">He asked the man whether he was in charge of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">The man said that he worked there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">Mr Taylor then said, 'It's illegal to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton caps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">' The man said, 'I only work here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">' Mr Taylor said, 'It doesn't matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">They can not be displayed for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">' The man ignored him and straightened the hats on the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">Mr Taylor asked for the stall number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">The man said, 'Don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">' Mr Taylor asked the business name of the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">The man said, 'No idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">' Mr Taylor then asked for his boss's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">He replied, 'I don't know' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">Mr Taylor said, 'Are you working here for nothing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">The man said, 'No, James pays me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">' Mr Taylor then left the stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">OTHER WITNESSES FOR THE APPLICANT 
 
96 There was other evidence from solicitors, private inquiry agents and employees of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">It is necessary only to refer in detail to the evidence of one of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Amy Rose Stead is a licensed security guard, who attended at the Market on 19 June 2005 with Mr Moes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">On that date she purchased a mobile telephone cover at the Funky Fones stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">The salesman refused to give her a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">She and Mr Moes then went to stall 210 where two women, Ms Barbara Maskiell and her assistant "Sandy" met them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">She did not see any Louis Vuitton products but did see other "designer" brand products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">She asked if they had any Louis Vuitton stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">Ms Maskiell said, 'No' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">Sandy then said to Ms Maskiell, 'They are all right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">They've been in the shop .</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">' Ms Maskiell said, 'That's right, I remember now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">' She then produced, from under the table, a shoulder bag bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks, including the "LV" letters or similar marks and said, 'I have this one and it is my last one I have here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">It was $225 and I put it down to $150, but as it's the last one you can have it for $90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">' Mr Moes said that he would purchase the bag on his credit card.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">She put it into a light brown dust bag marked 'Louis Vuitton Mallatier a Paris' and then into a white plastic bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Ms Maskiell gave Mr Moes a receipt, presumably a credit card voucher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">97 On that day, Mr Moes and Ms Stead also went to a stall kept by a woman known as Ruth, presumably Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">They did not purchase anything but, at a later stage, Ms Stead asked her if she had any Louis Vuitton bags for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">Ms Gallop said, 'No, I'm all sold out Sweetie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">See me next time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">' As I have said, Ms Gallop described this as a "throw away" line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">98 On 18 April 2005, on instructions from Mr Moes, Ms Stead telephoned the Market and spoke to a man named "Noel".</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">She asked about setting up a casual stall at the Market on Sunday 24 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">Noel said that she could do so and asked for her name and the type of goods she wished to sell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">She said that she would like to sell telephone covers, computer stuff and sunglasses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">' Noel said, 'Sorry, no sunglasses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">We have too many, thousands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">' She asked if there was any way at all that she could sell sunglasses and he said, ' No way and it doesn't matter how much you suck up to me I will not allow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">' 
 
99 Subsequently, she telephoned again, referring to her earlier telephone conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">She said it would be 'fine' if she could just sell telephone covers and computer equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Noel said that he had booked a casual stall for her and that she should arrive at about 6.00 am to set up by 7.00 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">She should see a man called "Dave".</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">On 24 April 2005 Ms Stead arrived at the Market at about 6.15 am, accompanied by her flat-mate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">She spoke to a lady at the window of a small office near the automatic teller machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">The woman said that her name was Jo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">She asked what Ms Stead would be selling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">She said, 'Mobile phone covers, some computer stuff and little bits and pieces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">' Jo did not ask to see her products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">Ms Stead paid $38.50 for the rental of the stall and received a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">Shortly afterwards she met a man called Dave who took her to her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">He asked if she would be selling new or second-hand goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">She said, 'I'll just be selling new bits and pieces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">' Dave said, 'I'll be back later to have a look at what you ladies are selling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">' He then departed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Ms Stead did not see him again whilst she was at the Market on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">100 Later in the day a man came to her stall and served a warning notice on behalf of the Anti-Counterfeiting Action Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">The notice alleged that she had been selling 'merchandise bearing trade marks that are substantially identical with or misleadingly, deceptively or confusingly similar to trade marks owned by the ACAG members ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">She said that other stallholders looked puzzled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">She then went to the office and spoke to Jo, telling her, 'I just got this, what is it for?</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">' She looked at it and said, 'I've never seen this notice before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">It must be something off the Internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Who gave it to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">' Ms Stead replied, 'Some guy walked past my stall and dropped it on my table and said to read it yet didn't give it to anyone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">' Jo asked, 'What were you selling?</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">' Ms Stead replied, 'Mobile phone covers, computer 'stuff' and bits and pieces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">' Jo said, 'Oh don't worry about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">I don't know who the hell he was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">If it was serious he would have come to us first to get your name and address but we don't have any names and it's your first time here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">' Jo then looked at the notice again and read out the words, 'You have been identified as selling trademark goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">' Ms Stead said, 'I'm confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">' Jo said, 'If you just have phone covers and little bits and pieces, ahh, don't worry, forget about it, its nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">' A man standing nearby then said, 'Mate don't worry about it, its just some guy being an idiot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">' Jo agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">The three of them then had a conversation in which Jo said a number of times, 'It's fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">It's someone being stupid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">Just ignore it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">' 
 
101 The woman named Jo was Ms Cochrane who gave evidence for the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">Her version of the conversation is a little different from that set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">The applicant seems to suggest that I should draw some inference adverse to the respondents from this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">I am unable to do so, quite apart from the question of conflicting evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">102 Ms Stead and Mr Moes visited the Market again on 7 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">Mr Moes took her to the "Funky Fones" stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">She saw two telephone covers bearing the applicant's "LV" trademark and one of its "flower" trademarks, or similar marks and two neck straps bearing the "LV" trademark or a similar mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">She purchased one of the telephone covers and one of the neck straps, tendering a $50 note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">She received $30 in change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">She asked for a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">The woman said that she did not have any receipts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">MR ROSENLUND 
 
103 The applicant's case is, in effect, that the respondents "joined in" the stallholders' infringements of its trademarks and so also infringed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">The conduct said to implicate the respondents is that:
 
 &#8226; Mr Rosenlund's attention had, over a number of years, been drawn to the offending conduct; and
 &#8226; the respondents as land owners had taken no effective steps to stop such conduct but, by act or omission, had tacitly accepted it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">(See pars 1 and 2 of the applicant's outline of submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">) 

104 It is said that "illegal sales" were drawn to Mr Rosenlund's attention on various occasions particularized in the applicant's outline (par 114) as follows (including references to the evidence):
 
 '(a) 15 December 1998 --- affidavit Ken Taylor at [12]; 
 (b) 6 December 2002 --- affidavit Ken Taylor at [19]; 
 (c) 3 July 2003 --- affidavit Ken Taylor at [24]; 
 
 
 (d) 15 January 2004 --- Exhibit JMR-12 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant's Notice to Admit Facts at [13] and [14]; 
 (e) 23 February 2004 --- Exhibit JMR-23 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant's Notice to Admit Facts at [17] and [18]; 
 (f) 10 February 2005 --- Exhibit JMR-25 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; Applicant's Notice to Admit Facts at [19] and []; 
 (g) 5 May 2005 --- Exhibit JMR-28 to the affidavit of Rosenlund; This notice was also sent to the company secretary; Applicant's Notice to Admit Facts at [21] and [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">' 
 
 

105 The dealings on 15 December 1998 and 6 December 2002 did not concern the applicant's products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">They primarily concerned the sale of counterfeit sunglasses, particularly by a Mr Osmond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">However the letter of 3 July 2003, whilst mainly concerned with sunglasses, also referred to other counterfeit products, including counterfeit copies of the applicant's products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">The letter recorded observations made on visits to the Market on 7 December 2002, 2 March 2003 and 29 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">Counterfeit copies of the applicant's products were seen on the first and second visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">After the second visit, the applicant's solicitors sent a "cease and desist" letter to one or more of the infringing stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">It seems that on the third visit, no counterfeit copies of the applicant's products were detected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">106 Mr Rosenlund did not have a detailed recollection of the events involving Mr Osmond to which Mr Taylor referred in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">However he said that on occasions, persons had sought his assistance in requesting stallholders to stop selling counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">His approach was to discuss the matter with the stallholder in question, confirm the illegality, and pass on any warning notice issued by the relevant trademark holder or manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">On occasions he had indicated that unless the stallholder stopped selling offending products, he or she might be excluded from the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">He claimed that the Market and its staff had always co-operated with the representatives of the owners of trademarks when asked to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">He said that it was impossible for management and staff to have the expertise necessary to identify counterfeit products amongst the hundreds of products at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">It is difficult to disagree with this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">107 On 15 January 2004, following trap purchases on 21 December 2003 and 11 January 2004, the applicant's solicitors wrote to Toea, complaining about the sale of counterfeit goods at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">Offending stallholders were Ms Gallop, Ms Byrne, Mr Alcock, "Pam", Irene Nazari and the stallholder of stall 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">Mr Rosenlund said that prior to that letter, he was not aware of any trade in counterfeit Louis Vuitton goods at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">This seems to overlook the letter of 3 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">However it may be that Mr Rosenlund had treated the absence of infringing products on 29 June 2003 as demonstrating that the problem had been resolved and forgotten about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">108 On 14 or 15 February 2004 he visited the six stallholders named in the letter of 15 January, telling them that they could not sell illegal products at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">In the course of doing so he encountered Mr Moes and was handed a letter dated 14 February 2004 from the solicitors for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">This was a "follow up" letter, pointing out that there had been no reply to the letter of 15 January 2004 and asserting that infringement was continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">Mr Rosenlund replied by letter dated 15 February 2004 saying, 'All six stallholders mentioned have now been visited and four of them removed all offending products while the other two will remove them today (Sunday 15 February).</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">They have been given the appropriate letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">All assure me that these products will not be sold in future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">' 
 
109 In a letter dated 23 February 2004 the applicant's solicitors advised of events which had occurred on a further visit by the applicant's agents on 15 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">It was said that Ms Gallop had asserted that Mr Rosenlund had said to her that she should not get caught selling any fake merchandise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">The applicant apparently invites the inference that this indicated a willingness to permit such sales provided that she was not caught.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">I am not sure that it would be fair to draw that inference but, in any event, Mr Rosenlund denies the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">There is no admissible evidence establishing that such statement was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">In the letter, it was also asserted that Mr Moes had heard Mr Alcock say to Mr Rosenlund, 'There you go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">That's another one sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">I only have two for sale now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">' According to Mr Moes, this was a reference to a sale to him of a product bearing Louis Vuitton marks or similar marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">Mr Rosenlund did not deny that such a remark was made, but denied that at the time, he was aware that any such sale had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">He claimed that in that conversation, he also said to Mr Alcock, concerning counterfeit goods, 'Gary you can't sell them and that's all there is to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">' In the letter of 23 February 2004 the solicitors also advised that agents had detected counterfeit goods and made trap purchases during the visit on 15 February.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">110 On 10 February 2005 the solicitors again wrote to Mr Rosenlund asserting that:
 
 'Ongoing surveillance of your market by our client's investigators has revealed that stall holders are still selling counterfeit goods that infringe our client's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">You may be interested to know that we are receiving active co-operation from other market proprietors who have agreed to the program specified in the attached Deed of Co-Operation (Deed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">We now seek your co-operation to the program by signing and returning to us the Deed within 14 days of 10 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">
 
 As you can see from the Deed, our client is more than willing to work with you to eradicate the illegal conduct being carried out at your premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">However, while our client seeks your co-operation, it remains firmly committed to resolving the ongoing problem of illegal dealings in counterfeit goods at your market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">' 
 

111 The applicant and Toea were to be parties to the attached draft deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">Pursuant to it, the applicant was to notify the landlord of any stallholder whom it detected in offering infringing products for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">It was also to make reasonable endeavours to assist Toea to identify infringing products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">Toea's proposed obligations were to:
 
 &#8226; give warning notices to all stallholders in a form prescribed by the applicant, stating that any stallholder found selling infringing products would be expelled from the Market; 
 &#8226; on a regular basis, inspect the Market for infringing products, and at least once every two months;
 &#8226; notify the applicant if it became aware of, or suspected any sales of infringing products by stallholders, providing full details;
 &#8226; expel any stallholder who had been given a copy of the warning notice and was subsequently identified by the applicant as selling infringing products;
 &#8226; permit inspection by the applicant's investigators;
 &#8226; permit such investigators to carry out ad hoc awareness programmes aimed at stallholders and Market employees; and
 &#8226; use its best endeavours to prevent infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">

112 Mr Rosenlund considered that it would have been difficult or impossible for Toea to comply with the clauses relating to the expulsion of stallholders who infringed trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">He also considered that employees did not have the experience or expertise necessary in order to recognize counterfeit products or to confirm that a product was counterfeit even if a representative of the applicant so asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Mr Rosenlund was also concerned that the deed might oblige him to expel a tenant who had been a good tenant for many years and whose livelihood was at stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">The decision of White J in Sun Valley Dried Fruit Pty Ltd v Toea &amp; Rosenlund (BS 9418/2004) caused at least part of Mr Rosenlund's concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">In that case, Sun Valley had sought to restrain Toea from terminating a licence to occupy and applied for an interlocutory injunction pending trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">The decision concerned only the application for interlocutory relief and is not authority for any particular view of the nature of the relationship between Toea and stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">Nonetheless it demonstrates the difficulties inherent in terminating such an arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">One can well understand that Mr Rosenlund might feel that it would be unwise to commit Toea to immediate expulsion of a stallholder if he was not sure that it would be able to honour such a commitment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">It might also be thought somewhat harsh that Toea should be obliged to act upon the applicant's opinion as to whether there had been an infringement, rather than upon its own view of the matter, and that it should retain no discretion to consider other circumstances in deciding how to deal with a particular infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">113 On Saturday 26 February and Sunday 27 February 2005, Mr Rosenlund and two members of his staff walked around the Market in order to see whether any Louis Vuitton products were being sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">They found none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">On 3 March 2005 Mr Rosenlund wrote to the solicitors, saying that he would not sign the deed of co-operation and outlining the steps which he had taken on the previous weekend to detect any further infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">He indicated that he would continue to take these steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">114 On 5 May 2005 the solicitors for the applicant again wrote to Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">They set out the previous history of dealings between the parties and asserted that Ms Gallop and Mr Alcock had again, on 11 February 2004, 17 February 2004 and 24 April 2005, been found selling infringing goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">The solicitors indicated that they considered that Mr Rosenlund was not co-operating with the applicant and continued:
 
 'Your company's conduct in allowing stall-holders at Carrara Market to deal in Infringing Goods is likely to constitute an involvement by your company, and its officers, as joint tortfeasor with those stall-holders of infringement of the Louis Vuitton trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">
 
 Our client has previously indicated in our letter dated 15 January 2004, and in a Deed of Co-operation that was sent to you on 10 February 2005, that it is more than willing to work with your company to prevent the unlawful sale of Infringing Goods that is being carried on at Carrara Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">However, in your letter dated 3 March 2005, your company declined to sign our Deed of Co-operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">
 
 We understand from your letter dated 3 March 2005, that so-called " permanent stalls" may have been bought for $50,000, while the Carrara website states that casual stall-holders pay $38.50 to hire for a stall for one day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">Clearly, your company is obtaining significant financial benefits from stall-holders at Carrara Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">In our client's view, given your company's control over the Carrara Market, it appears that your company is sanctioning and also benefiting financially from stall-holders that sell Infringing Goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">
 
 Our client considers that the only measures that will be adequate to prevent the ongoing infringements at Carrara Market are to take appropriate action against the stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G. Accordingly, our client demands that your company: 
 
 
 
 (a) expel any casual stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G from the Carrara Market by 4 pm on Sunday 8 May 2005 and prohibit them from hiring casual stalls at Carrara Market in the future; 
 
 (b) take whatever steps that you are legally able to in order to stop "permanent stall-holders" identified in Schedule C to G from selling Infringing Goods at the Carrara Market, which may mean giving reasonable notice to them that you will evict them within one month for breach of the terms on which they hold a permanent stall; and 
 
 (c) inform us by 4.00 pm on Friday 12 May of compliance with the demands contained in this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">
 
 
 
 If these demands are not fully satisfied by the dates referred to, we expect that our client will commence Federal Court proceedings against your company and any relevant officers of your company (including but not limited to directors and employees personally involved) without further notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">In any such Federal Court proceedings our client will seek both interlocutory and permanent injunctions against your company, damages or an account of profits, and its costs.</sentence>

115 Mr Rosenlund instructed Mr Edmondson to speak to the relevant stallholders, telling them not to sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and that further infringement could affect their capacity to hold their stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">On the next weekend he also visited those stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">Details of these visits appear in the evidence of the various stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">After receiving the statement of claim in these proceedings Mr Rosenlund spoke to Ms Byrne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">She had not been mentioned in the letter of 5 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">He warned her that if she was again caught selling Louis Vuitton products, she would be expelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">She denied that she had been doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">116 Upon receiving affidavits concerning the Funky Fones stall, he told the stallholder that he was, under no circumstances, to sell any Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">The stallholder denied having done so and said that he would not be doing so in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Mr Rosenlund dealt similarly with Ms Maskiell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">She admitted having possessed one Louis Vuitton bag which she had produced to the applicant's agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">She undertook that she would not, in the future, bring any such products to the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">Mr Rosenlund also spoke to Ms Gallop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">I have already outlined that conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">117 During the week prior to 30 July 2005, Mr Rosenlund telephoned a friend, Ms Melissa Leak and asked her to visit the Market on the following weekend to see whether there were any Louis Vuitton goods on sale, particularly at the Alcock, Byrne, Gallop and Funky Fones stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Mr Rosenlund understood that on Saturday 30 July 2005 she attended at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">She subsequently reported that she had not located any such goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">At each of the specified stalls she asked for Louis Vuitton products and was told that there was none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">In this context, the reference to Louis Vuitton products seems to have included counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">118 Since September 2005 Mr Rosenlund has prohibited the sale of any Louis Vuitton products or "look-alike" products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">This policy was motivated by the fact that it was impossible for his staff to determine whether or not a particular product was authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">Some stallholders were concerned at being asked by customers if they had Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">One stallholder erected a sign saying that he or she had none and requesting customers not to ask for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">Since September 2005 new stallholders have been specifically asked whether Louis Vuitton products are to be sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">It is made clear that they are not to sell them, and that bookings will not be taken if they intend to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">A similar procedure is adopted when casual stallholders arrive on Saturday mornings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">119 Much of the cross-examination of Mr Rosenlund was designed to establish that he conducted the Market with the aim of maximizing the return to Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">It would be surprising if it were otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">No doubt he tries to create an environment in which access and parking are easy, the range of stalls is extensive and entertainment and refreshments are available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">I infer that he expects and demands co-operation from stallholders in creating this environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">They do so in connection with parking, honouring vouchers and being open at fixed times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">There are no doubt many other areas in which co-operation is necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">120 Mr Rosenlund said in cross-examination that some casual stallholders had not returned to the Market after he had spoken to them about selling counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">It is fair to say that in his cross-examination Mr Rosenlund indicated a fairly merciful approach towards some infringing stallholders, based upon their long associations with the Market and their financial positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">For example, concerning Linda Byrne who was caught selling counterfeit goods in December 2004 and May 2005, he said:
 
 'When we got the second letter, the first letter of 15 January 2004 was the one with all the trap purchases in the photos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">The second letter I got from Corrs Chambers about Louis Vuitton was one asking me to sign an undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">The third one was in May this year which listed some more photos and five stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">Now, Linda wasn't included in that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">If she had been, she might have gone close to going.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">She wasn't listed at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">I'm not sure why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">It wasn't until later on, when there was a statement of claim came, that her name was included, and I specifically went straight down and saw her and she said, "Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">I wasn't.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">" If she had been included in the one in May when I went and saw Gary Alcock and Ruth Gallop, she might have gone close to going.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">' 
 

121 With respect to Ms Gallop, it was put to Mr Rosenlund that she had been caught selling counterfeit merchandise on various occasions including January 2004 and May 2005 and was still there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">Mr Rosenlund said:
 
 'She is ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">I should be a little less merciful perhaps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">Ruth was caught the first time with quite a number of items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">The second time she had only two wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">She's a 70 year old pensioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">She promised me it wouldn't happen again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">She certainly scaled down what she said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">It was certainly far, far less than the first time, and I gave it serious thought, but if I --- and I'm not unwilling to expel people and I'm not preoccupied with it, but I am willing to expel people once they cross the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">I've got to be able to justify that to myself and to other people and be able to defend that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">I looked at this poor old lady and thought, "I'll give her one more chance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">This is a bit tough, throwing her out here when she promises me this time it will never happen again and she's had two wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">" I mean, there's --- there's no law that says I've got to expel people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">I just felt it was a tough call, but, certainly, caught again, she's crossed the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">' 
 

122 Mr Rosenlund agreed that he had expelled some casual stallholders for parking on Market premises, contrary to prevailing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">He said that parking was a serious problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">He did not consider that it was a more serious issue than the sale of counterfeit goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">Mr Rosenlund pointed out the difficulty of detecting counterfeit goods concealed in stalls, short of searching them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">It is fair to say that Mr Rosenlund also demonstrated a willingness to accept at face value, explanations given by stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">On the other hand, it is difficult to know what else he could do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">123 Mr Rosenlund was cross-examined about his failure to detect apparently counterfeit goods present at stalls when he visited them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">This line of cross-examination failed to recognize the difference between Mr Rosenlund's duties and functions, on the one hand, and those of the applicant's agents on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">Whilst such agents no doubt knew specifically what they were looking for, one could not reasonably expect Mr Rosenlund to have been, at all times, conscious of the appearance of Louis Vuitton goods and therefore of their presence at a particular stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">He also could not be expected to be able to distinguish between counterfeit and authentic Louis Vuitton goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">I see no basis for holding that he was obliged to acquaint himself with such matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">After all, the applicant is certainly not the only organization which wishes to protect its trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">I agree with Mr Rosenlund that manufacturers and suppliers cannot reasonably expect him or his staff to police observance of their trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">Of course that is not to say that they may connive at, or encourage, infringement of such trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">124 Mr Rosenlund considered that it would have been helpful had the applicant's agents spoken to him directly about strategies for preventing trademark infringement instead of using the trap purchase technique.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">The applicant's answer to that seemed to be that there are about 4,000 markets in Australia, and that it would be difficult to make suitable arrangements with each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">However Mr Rosenlund had over 400 stalls to supervise and, as I have said, the applicant is not the only trademark holder in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">Mr Rosenlund conceded that on any one day, items which infringed trademarks would probably be sold from a stall or stalls in the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">He would prefer to be rid of the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">Counterfeit goods cause pain to the Market and to other stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">125 On 20 September 2005, the solicitors for Toea and Mr Rosenlund wrote to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">That letter is exhibit 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">It was said to be 'Without prejudice save as to costs' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">It is, nonetheless, in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">The solicitors asserted that the applicant's case was not maintainable in law and gave notice of their intention, if successful in these proceedings, of seeking orders for costs on a basis other than "party and party".</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">On 6 December 2005 the applicant's solicitors wrote (exhibit 15), offering to settle these proceedings upon the basis that Toea and Mr Rosenlund enter into a proposed deed and that the parties pay their own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">Mr Rosenlund considered the deed to be too inflexible in some respects and so did not sign it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">Perhaps unfortunately, he did not seek to negotiate variations to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">The applicant's offer was rejected (exhibit 17).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">The letter and draft deed are exhibit 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">126 Mr Rosenlund said that he had not informed the applicant of his "no Louis Vuitton" policy and had not undertaken to continue that policy for the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">He said, however, that he and Toea did not want Louis Vuitton items or counterfeit items sold at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">OTHER WITNESSES FOR THE RESPONDENTS 
 
127 Mr Edmondson also gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">He has been employed part-time by Toea as an office administrator since 16 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">His duties include administrative tasks such as dealing with accounts receivable and general enquiries, liaising with stallholders and the public and other duties as directed by Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">He said that since May 2005 it has been Market policy to inform casual stallholders that they may not sell counterfeit goods, and that the Market will not rent sites to them if such goods are to be offered for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">In or about September 2005 Mr Rosenlund introduced a "no Louis Vuitton" policy at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">Stallholders are prohibited from selling any Louis Vuitton products or "look-alike" Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">Mr Edmondson informs potential stallholders of these policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">If he sees offending products he orders their removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">He gave evidence concerning the various conversations which he had with stallholders concerning alleged infringements of the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">He was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">128 Joanne Joyce Cochrane is employed full-time by Toea as an office administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Her duties include writing letters and memoranda, replying to emails, coding accounts, attending to petty cash and wages, photocopying, maintaining the list of permanent stallholders, collecting rent and banking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">She also deals with customers and stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">She gave evidence similar to that of Mr Edmondson concerning the reservation and allocation of stalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">She also enforces the policies relating to counterfeit goods and Louis Vuitton goods to which he referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">129 She was the person who spoke to Ms Stead concerning the notice which she received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">She said that Ms Stead's account of the conversation omitted one aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">Ms Cochrane said that she asked Ms Stead whether she was selling anything "wrong", including illegal goods or anything which breached copyright and said, 'If you're not selling anything illegal then you haven't got anything to worry about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">' She has been instructed by Mr Rosenlund that if a representative of the owner of a trademark or an investigator enquires as to the name and contact details of stallholders, such information is to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">130 Ms Leak also gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">She said that on 25 July 2005 Mr Rosenlund asked that on the next weekend, she visit the Market and, in particular, five identified stalls to see if she could detect any items for sale which looked like Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">She did so, specifically asking each of those stallholders if he or she had any Louis Vuitton articles for sale and saying that she was keen to buy such articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">At each stall she was told that it had no such articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">She also walked around the Market generally and had a good look at a number of other stalls, particularly those selling products similar to Louis Vuitton products, such as bags, accessories, wallets, purses and watches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">She looked at approximately twenty stalls in addition to the five to which she had been directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">She did not see any Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">She was at the Market for between one-and-a-half and two hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">FINDINGS 
 
131 There is little real conflict in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">However I should address three factual matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">The first is Mr Moes' allegation that on 15 February 2004 Mr Rosenlund heard Mr Alcock say words to the effect that he had just sold 'another one' and had only 'two' left, referring to counterfeit Louis Vuitton products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">I do not understand Mr Rosenlund to have denied that Mr Alcock used such words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">However he claimed not to have associated them with the sale of a product which infringed any of the applicant's trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">Had Mr Rosenlund intended to lie about this matter, he could simply have denied that the statement attributed to Mr Alcock had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">It may be that such a response would have led to the applicant cross-examining Mr Alcock as to whether the statement was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that Mr Rosenlund would have refrained from denying the statement, yet lied about the associated matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">132 Much may have depended upon the context in which Mr Alcock's remark was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">Mr Rosenlund struck me as a basically truthful witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">It is clear that at the time, he was taking steps to ensure that stallholders were aware that Toea would not countenance the sale of counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">The applicant at least implied that such steps as he took were merely window-dressing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">On balance, I reject that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">On later visits by the applicant's agents, at least some of the stallholders demonstrated their awareness that they should conceal offending products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">Whilst this may have been attributable to their fear that the applicant's agents would detect them in infringements, it may also have been attributable to Mr Rosenlund's actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop all confirmed that Mr Rosenlund had spoken to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">None of them seems to have thought that the warnings were issued other than with the intention that they be heeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">In those circumstances it is unlikely that Mr Rosenlund would simply have ignored another offending sale occurring under his nose, or tolerated the prospect of two further sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">In the circumstances I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Rosenlund was not aware that the remark made by Mr Alcock referred to a sale or potential sale of an infringing product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">133 The second factual dispute which I should resolve is that between Ms Stead and Ms Cochrane as to the content of the conversation concerning the notice that was served on Ms Stead at her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">The difference between the two versions is that Ms Cochrane asserts that she asked whether Ms Stead was selling 'anything illegal or anything that breaches copyright' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">Given the limited nature of the issue and the limited opportunity to assess the witnesses, I am unpersuaded that either version should be preferred to the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">134 The third matter is Mr Moes' assertion that Ms Gallop alleged that Mr Rosenlund had encouraged her to think that she need only avoid being detected in infringing conduct but not necessarily refrain from such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">Ms Gallop said, in her affidavit, that Mr Rosenlund had extracted an assurance that she would not again sell counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and then said, 'Don't let us catch you again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">' In that context it is impossible to construe Mr Rosenlund's words in the way suggested by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">Mr Rosenlund's own evidence was to similar effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">I infer that Mr Rosenlund intended to leave Ms Gallop with the impression that she was not to sell infringing goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">135 There are a number of other, more general observations which I should make about the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">Clearly, the applicant's agents were anxious to detect infringement and had familiarized themselves with the applicant's trademarks for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">They went to the Market with the intention of identifying counterfeit Louis Vuitton products and sales of such products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">It is likely that they were much more alert to the presence of potentially infringing products than would be an ordinary member of the public, or were Mr Rosenlund and his employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">No doubt, as his dealings with the applicant's agents continued, Mr Rosenlund became more conscious of the problem, but that does not lead me to conclude that it became, or should have become, the primary focus of his managerial activities and responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">Whilst one might have expected him to cast a rather more critical eye over the goods offered at the various stalls, particularly those which had previously been detected in infringement, his responsibilities were such that his attention was always likely to be distracted by other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">136 Mr Rosenlund conceded that on any one day, counterfeit items are probably sold somewhere in the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">He would prefer that such sales did not take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">When he was informed of infringing sales he took appropriate action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">It may be that he did not accord the matter the priority which the applicant would have liked, but that preference offers no guide to his legal obligations or to those of Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">137 I accept that Mr Rosenlund's primary aim was to continue the profitable operation of the Market, and that he did this by maximizing attendance, facilitating access and providing entertainment, as well as ensuring that the range of goods offered for sale was attractive to potential customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">There is no evidence that the availability of counterfeit designer goods was a significant aspect of the success of the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">Mr Rosenlund considered it to be an undesirable, but unavoidable, incident of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">There is certainly no direct evidence to suggest that he, in any way, encouraged stallholders to offer such products for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">The applicant invites me to infer from his conduct that he encouraged or tolerated the sale of counterfeit goods, but I see no basis for such an inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">I accept that he wished to maintain reasonable relations with his stallholders, particularly those who had long-term associations with the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">I infer that he did not consider that it was necessarily in the best interests of the Market to take stringent action with every stallholder who was detected in the infringement of a trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">138 Much of the applicant's argument hinges upon the assumption that Toea, through Mr Rosenlund, could control the products which were sold at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">In a legal sense that assumption is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">Regardless of any arrangements pursuant to which a stall was occupied, it would probably have been open to Toea to terminate such occupancy in the event that it became aware that a stallholder proposed to engage in unlawful conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">Toea was not contractually bound to permit such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">Whether it would have been entitled to determine any ongoing contractual arrangement for past misconduct of that kind may be a different matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">I assume for present purposes that it would have been so entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">However the legal right to control the range of goods being sold says nothing about physical ability to prevent all infringing sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">Had a stallholder evinced a clear and overt intention to sell counterfeit goods, then Toea may arguably have been obliged to terminate his or her right to occupy a stall or otherwise trade in that way at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">However that was not the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">Relatively small quantities of infringing goods were displayed at some stalls on some occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">On other occasions stallholders produced infringing items on request, but were not otherwise overtly dealing in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">There is no evidence that Toea or Mr Rosenlund ever had prior knowledge of a stallholder's possession of infringing goods or of his or her intention to sell such goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">I infer that the respondents dealt in good faith with its stallholders and with the applicant's agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">They also assumed good faith on the part of the stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">139 There was always the possibility that a stallholder would sell infringing goods, but I do not accept that the respondents should have proceeded on the basis that the likelihood of infringement was any higher than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">There is no suggestion that the sale of infringing goods was a substantial part of the business of any stallholder or that it was a particularly lucrative trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">I see no basis for the assertion that the respondents were 'willfully blind' to the possibility of infringing conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">THE LAW 
 
140 In pars 1 and 2 of its outline the applicant puts its case as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">This proceeding raises for determination by the Court the extent of the obligations of a owner of market premises, where it is drawn to the owner's attention that, over a period of years, some of the stallholder licensees are engaging in the unlawful conduct of selling counterfeit goods and thereby infringing a number of registered trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">It is contended that where, as here, the landowner takes no effective steps to stop the conduct but by acts or omissions tacitly accepts it, the landowner in fact joins in the tort and becomes independently liable as a joint tortfeasor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">' 
 
 

141 In the course of the trial, the applicant sought to base its case on three different propositions, namely:
 
 &#8226; that a person in control of premises who benefits from another's activities on those premises is liable for torts committed by that other person in conducting those activities;
 &#8226; that a licensor who, having knowledge of past torts committed by a licensee on the relevant premises, permits the licensee to continue using the premises is liable for any further torts (of the same kind) committed by the licensee; and
 &#8226; that a licensor is liable for torts committed by a licensee in carrying out their joint enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">

142 In the course of oral submissions counsel put the case in this way (at TS 200 ll 25-30):
 
 'Our starting point is very simple, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">When one goes to The Koursk ([1924] P 140) which has been adopted as the foundation of the principle of joint tortfeasorship by the High Court in Thompson's case, [ Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 ] and we've set it out in paragraph 18 of our outline, Scrutton LJ spoke of two persons who agree on a common action in the course of, and to further which one of them commits a tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">
 
 And that's the foundation of what are joint tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">In this case, in our respectful submission, the evidence is clear that Toea, as landlord or land owner, and the stallholders, who are two or more persons, agree on a common action, the common action being the promotion of their joint businesses at the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">' 
 

143 Given that the relevant cause of action is created by the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth) (the "Trademarks Act"), one might reasonably have expected the applicant's case to commence with an examination of the relevant statutory provisions, with a view to identifying the extent to which either of the respondents could be said to have infringed in the sense defined in s 120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">Pursuant to ss 125 and 126, proceedings may be brought for such an infringement, seeking injunctive relief, damages or an account of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">Criminal liability is imposed by Pt 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">Section 150 provides that a person who aids, abets, counsels, procures or is knowingly concerned in the doing of an act outside of Australia which, if done in Australia, would be an offence, is taken to have committed the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">That section is said to be without prejudice to the operation of s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (now s 11.2 of the Criminal Code ) which deals with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring an offence committed by another person within Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">However no provision extends civil liability to 'secondary' tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">Thus the applicant seeks to rely on principles as to liability in tort drawn from the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">144 Although the applicant's case has been put in various ways, my understanding is that the case against each of the respondents depends upon the allegations in par 34 of the further amended statement of claim (exhibit 13) that:
 
 'By reason of the matters referred to above (Toea) and/or (Mr Rosenlund) have infringed and continue to infringe one or more of the Louis Vuitton trademarks as the conduct of the infringing stallholders was conduct undertaken with the concurrence of (Toea) and/or (Mr Rosenlund) and pursuant to their common design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">' 
 

145 The reference to 'the conduct of the infringing stallholders' relates to pars 14, 15 and 16 of the further amended statement of claim in which allegations are made against Mr Alcock, Ms Byrne and Ms Gallop respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">Those allegations include specific allegations of infringement of the applicant's trademarks by sale of identified products on identified dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">The evidence concerning those transactions has been set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">However there are also allegations, completely unparticularized, of infringement by manufacture, importation, advertisement and offering for sale, distribution or supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">Although there is some evidence of items, apparently bearing Louis Vuitton trademarks, having been seen at stalls (other than those items which were the subject of trap purchases), none of those items was examined by either Mr Bombardi or Mr Pichon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">There is no evidence that they were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">I do not understand the applicant to rely upon display of those items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">In the end the claims against each respondent depend upon the various trap purchases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">146 In par 34, the applicant also asserts that the conduct of infringing stallholders was 'conduct undertaken with the concurrence of the first and/or the second respondents and pursuant to their common design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">' The allegation of 'concurrence' is particularized in earlier paragraphs of the further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">The applicant's case is that, with knowledge of past infringements, the respondents permitted the infringing stallholders to continue to trade at the Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">As to the question of 'common design', this assertion was developed in oral submissions, but no such design is particularized in the further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">It seems that the applicant asserts that the common design was to achieve success for the market through the success of individual stalls including, in particular, those of the infringing stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">147 At this point I should make two comments concerning the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">Firstly, the case has been conducted upon the basis that no distinction should be drawn between the liability of Toea and that of Mr Rosenlund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">Secondly, the applicant has not demonstrated that Mr Rosenlund or Toea was actually aware, in advance of any sale, that a relevant stallholder had counterfeit products at the Market or intended to sell such products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">As I have said, in many cases the goods were not on display, but were produced from places of concealment in response to requests from the applicant's agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">148 I have previously referred to the applicant's reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeal in The "Koursk" (supra).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">However I suspect that it has misconceived that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">The case arose out of a collision at sea involving the "Clan Chisholm", The "Koursk" and the "Itria" , leading to the loss of the "Itria" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">The owners of the "Itria" sued the owners of the other vessels, alleging separate and independent acts of negligence against each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">The question was whether judgment recovered against the owners of the "Clan Chisholm" barred a further action by the owners of the "Itria" against the owners of The "Koursk" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">This depended upon whether the two ship owners (of the "Clan Chisholm" and The "Koursk" ) were joint or several tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">Bankes LJ adopted the following proposition from Clerk and Lindsell on Torts , 7th ed at p 59:
 
 'Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">' 
 

149 Scrutton LJ said at 155:
 
 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by "joint tortfeasors"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">and one way of answering it is: "Is the cause of action against them the same?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be "joint tortfeasors": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">These seem clearly joint tortfeasor; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">' 
 

150 The applicant fastens on the proposition concerning two persons who agree on common action in the course of which one commits a tort, submitting that the present case fits that description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">However that observation by Scrutton LJ must be read in the context of his Lordship's later remarks at 156 where he referred with approval to the statement in Clerk and Lindsall (to which Bankes LJ had referred), that:
 
 ' "Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design" ... "But mere similarity of design on the part of independent actors, causing independent damage, is not enough; there must be concerted action to a common end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">" Still more so when there is not even similarity of design, but independent negligence accidentally resulting in one damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">' 
 

151 At 159 Sargant LJ adopted the same passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">152 The applicant points to the reference by Scrutton LJ to 'common action' and asserts that in this case, the common action agreed upon between the respondents and each stallholder was 'the function of their joint businesses at the Market' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">No doubt the respondents desired that the Market be successful and took steps to achieve that aim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">No doubt, too, each stallholder desired that his or her stall be successful and took steps to achieve that aim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">However that does not lead to the conclusion that the respondents and each stallholder had agreed on common action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">Aims are not actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">The term 'common action' must surely mean 'steps to be taken' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">At p 155 of The "Koursk" , Scrutton LJ was identifying common relationships in which joint torts generally occur, rather than the underlying principle which defines the relationship of joint tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">At 156, his Lordship addressed that principle, holding that each party must share in the commission of the tort in furtherance of a common design, not merely in furtherance of similar designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">153 I turn to the decision of the House of Lords in CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">The facts appear sufficiently from the head note as follows:
 
 'The plaintiffs, suing on behalf of themselves and other copyright owners in the music trade, claimed that the defendants, by manufacturing, advertising and offering for sale hi-fi systems with facilities for, inter alia, recording at high speed from pre-recorded cassettes onto blank tapes, had authorised and incited members of the public to infringe their copyrights, were joint infringers with such members of the public and were in breach of a duty of care owed to the copyright owners not to supply the machines without taking such precautions as would reasonably ensure that the copyrights would not be infringed by their use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">They sought an injunction to retrain the defendants from parting with possession of the machines, or any like machines, without taking such precautions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">' 
 

154 At 1055, Lord Templeman said:
 
 'BPI next submitted that Amstrad were joint infringers; they became joint infringers if and as soon as a purchaser decided to copy a record in which copyright subsisted; Amstrad could become joint infringers not only with the immediate purchaser of an Amstrad model but also with anyone else who at any time in the future used the model to copy records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">My Lords, Amstrad sells models which include facilities for the receiving and recording broadcasts, disc records and taped records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">All these facilities are lawful, although the recording device is capable of being used for unlawful purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">Once a model is sold Amstrad have no control over or interest in its use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">In these circumstances the allegation that Amstrad is a joint infringer is untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">In Townsend v Haworth (1875) 48 L.J.Ch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">770n, decided in 1875 but reported in 1879 the defendant sold chemicals to be used by the purchaser in an infringement of patent and agreed to indemnify the purchaser if the patent should prove to be valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">Mellish L.J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">said, at p.773: 
 
 
 
 "Selling materials for the purpose of infringing a patent to the man who is going to infringe it, even although the party who sells it knows that he going to infringe it and indemnifies him, does not by itself make the person who so sells an infringer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">He must be a party with the man who so infringes, and actually infringe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">" 
 
 
 
 Mr Kentridge on behalf of B.P.I.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">relied on the decision in Innes v Short &amp; Beal (1898) 15 R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">449.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">In that case the defendant Short sold powdered zinc and gave instructions to a purchaser to enable the purchaser to infringe a process patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">Bigham J said at p 452: 
 
 
 
 "There is no reason whatever why Mr Short should not sell powdered zinc, and he will not be in the wrong, though he may know or expect the people who buy it from him are going to use it in such a way as will amount to an infringement of Mr Innes' patent rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">But he must not ask the people to use it in that way, and he must not ask the people to use it in that way in order to induce them to buy his powdered zinc from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">" 
 
 
 
 Assuming that decision to be correct, it does not assist BPI because in the present case Amstrad did not ask anyone to use an Amstrad model in a way which would amount to an infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">
 
 In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v David Moseley &amp; Sons Ltd [1904] 1 Ch 164,171, ... the defendant sold tyre covers which were an essential feature of a combination patent for tyres and rims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">The tyre covers were adapted for use in the manner described in the patent, but not necessarily solely for use in that manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">Swinfen-Eady J said ... that most of the "covers would probably ultimately be used in one or other of" the patented methods but that 
 
 
 
 "those are not exhaustive of the purposes to which the covers may be put, and that they would be useful for other purposes in connection with other tyres ..." 
 
 
 
 ...' 
 

155 At 1057 his Lordship continued:
 
 'My Lords, joint infringers are two or more persons who act in concert with one another pursuant to a common design in the infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">In the present case there was no common design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">Amstrad sold a machine and the purchaser or the operator of the machine decided the purpose for which the machine should from time to time be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">The machine was capable of being used for lawful or unlawful purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">All recording machines and many other machines are capable of being used for unlawful purposes but manufacturers and retailers are not joint infringers if purchasers choose to break the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">Since Amstrad did not make or authorise other persons to make a record embodying a recording in which copyright subsisted, Amstrad did not entrench upon the exclusive rights granted by the Act of 1956 to copyright owners and Amstrad were not in breach of the duties imposed by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">' 
 

156 In Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (supra) the facts, according to the head note, were as follows:
 
 'A television station broadcast live to viewers in the Australian Capital Territory a current affairs programme produced by another station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">The licence to broadcast was granted by PBL which was a related entity of the producer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">The content of the broadcast was defamatory of T. T settled with the producer and gave it a release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">T sued the broadcaster in the Supreme Court of the Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">The broadcaster joined the producer and PBL as third parties, seeking contribution and also damages for breach of an implied condition of the licence agreement that they would exercise reasonable care to ensure that the relayed programme would not include defamatory material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">
 
 Although the broadcaster took no part in the production of the programme, it acted in its own right and had the ability to control and supervise the material it televised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">The broadcaster voluntarily decided to broadcast live.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">It sought to defend the proceedings on the grounds that it and the producer were joint tortfeasors and that the release granted to the producer by T also released it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">' 
 

157 At 580-581, the majority (Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
 
 'The difference between joint tortfeasors and several tortfeasors is that the former are responsible for the same tort whereas the latter are responsible only for the same damage ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">As was said in The "Koursk" ..., for there to be joint tortfeasors "there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a co-incidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">Principal and agent may be joint tortfeasors where the agent commits a tort on behalf of the principal, as master and servant may be where the servant commits a tort in the course of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">Persons who breach a joint duty may also be joint tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">Otherwise, to constitute joint tortfeasors two or more persons must act in concert in committing the tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">' 
 

158 At 600, Gummow J (Gaudron J concurring) also identified the decision in The "Koursk" as defining joint liability for the purposes of Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">At 601 --- 602, his Honour distinguished the decision in CBS Songs on its fact but did not doubt its correctness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">159 Finally, I should refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">It is not necessary to set out the rather complex facts of the case, but I will include two extended extracts from the reasons for judgment of Stuart-Smith and Hobhouse LLJJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">Stuart-Smith LJ said at 35:
 
 'Be that as it may, it seems to me to be well established that a person who acts with another to commit a tort in furtherance of a common design will be liable as a joint tortfeasor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">It is not enough that he merely facilitates the commission of the tort unless his assistance is given in pursuance and furtherance of the common design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">' 
 

160 His Honour referred to the The "Koursk" and another case, and then observed that Lord Justice Mustill, in Unilever PLC v Gillette (UK) Ltd [1989] RPC 583:
 
 '... stated the common law rule that two persons were joint tortfeasors --- 
 
 ... where the two were concerned in a joint act done in pursuance of a common purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">
 
 After reviewing the patent cases and the speech of Lord Templeman in CBS Songs Ltd v Armstrad ... Lord Justice Mustill said at p 609 that the relevant question is whether: 
 
 
 
 (a) there was a common design between B and G to do acts which, if the patent is upheld, amounted to infringements, and (b) B had acted in furtherance of that design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">I use the word "common design" because they are readily to hand, but there are other expressions in the cases, such as "concerted action" or "agreed or common action" which will serve just as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">' 
 
 
 

161 Hobhouse LJ sought to compare treatment in the criminal law of parties to offences with the treatment of persons 'involved' in the commission of torts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">His Lordship (at 42-43) identified three categories of persons other than the actual offender, to whom criminal liability attaches, namely:
 
 &#8226; those who solicit or incite another to commit a crime or conspire with another to commit a crime;
 &#8226; those who aid another in the commission of a crime, often known as 'aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring' ; and
 &#8226; principals whose agents commit offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">

162 Hobhouse LJ subsequently referred to The "Koursk" , CBS Songs and Unilever , concluding (at 46) that these cases established that:
 
 'It is only conduct which comes into the first or the third of the categories I have set out above which constitute the commission of a tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">The criminal law for obvious policy reasons goes further than the civil law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">Acts which knowingly facilitate the commission of a crime amount to the crime of aiding and abetting but they do not amount to a tort or make the aider liable as a joint tortfeasor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">' 
 

163 His Lordship continued:
 
 'Accordingly, in my judgment there is no second category in the law of tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">Mere assistance, even knowing assistance, does not suffice to make the "secondary" party jointly liable as a joint tortfeasor with the primary party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">What he does must go further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">He must have conspired with the primary party or procured or induced his commission of the tort (my first category); or he must have joined in the common design pursuant to which the tort was committed (my third category).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">' 
 

164 In Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names 14 th ed at par 19-044, the learned authors observe, in connection with trademarks, that:
 
 'For the general principles applicable in relation to joint liability based on procurement or common design see CBS v Armstrad and Credit Lyonnais v Export Credit Guarantee Department '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">
 

Those decisions are based on that in The "Koursk" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">The High Court's view of that case appears from the decision in Thompson v Australian Capital Television and is the relevant test for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">165 The applicant puts some emphasis upon Toea's legal capacity to control use of the Market premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">It implicitly asserts that the respondents failed to prevent infringement notwithstanding that power, and that such failure is a basis for inferring their 'concurrence' in the infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">The question of control has arisen frequently in connection with breach of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">Subsection 36(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the " Copyright Act ") provides that a person infringes a copyright if he or she 'not being the owner of the copyright, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright, does in Australia, or authorises the doing in Australia, any act comprised in the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">' In University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1974-1975) 133 CLR 1, the High Court considered the case of a university library which had provided photocopying machines on its premises, one of which had been used to make an unauthorized copy of a literary work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">The question was whether the university had infringed by authorization.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">At 20-21, Jacobs J, with whom McTiernan J agreed, said concerning the word 'authorises' :
 
 'It is established that word is not limited to the authorising of an agent by a principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">Where there is such an authority the act of the agent is the act of the principal and thus the principal himself may be said to do the act comprised in the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">But authorisation is wider than authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">It has, in relation to a similar use in previous copyright legislation, been given the meaning, taken from the Oxford Dictionary, of "sanction, approve, countenance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">...I have no doubt that the word is used in the same sense in section 36(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">It is a wide meaning which in cases of permission or invitation is apt to apply both where an express permission or invitation is extended to do the act comprising the copyright and where such a permission or invitation may be implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">Where a general permission or invitation may be implied it is clearly unnecessary that the authorising party have knowledge that a particular act comprised in the copyright will be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">
 
 The acts and omissions of the alleged authorising party must be looked at in the circumstances in which the act comprised in the copyright is done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">The circumstances will include the likelihood that such an act will be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">"... (t)he Court may infer an authorisation or permission from acts which fall short of being direct and positive; ... indifference, exhibited by acts of commission or omission, may reach a degree from which authorisation or permission may be inferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">It is a question of fact in each case what is the true inference to be drawn from the conduct of the person who is said to have authorised ..." ' 
 

166 See also CBS Songs (supra) at 1053-1055 and Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v The Commonwealth (1993) 67 ALJR 315 at 317.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">167 Frequently, the capacity to authorize will depend upon the capacity to control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">In that sense, the question of control is implicit in the concept of authorization.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">Subsequent amendments to s 36 of the Copyright Act have made that clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">Subsection 36(1A) now provides that in determining whether or not a person has authorized the doing of any act, matters to be taken into account include:
 
 
 '(a) the extent (if any) of the person's power to prevent the doing of the act concerned; 
 
 (b) the nature of any relationship existing between the person and the person who did the act concerned; 
 
 (c) whether the person took any reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the doing of the act, including whether the person complied with any relevant industry codes of practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">' 
 
 
 

168 There will be cases in which the relationship between the person who commits a tort and another person may be such as to amount to both authorization (in the case of copyright) and also to satisfy the test for joint tortfeasors laid down in The "Koursk" and Thompson v Australian Capital Television.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">However to prove authorization is not necessarily to prove infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">As the present case demonstrates, control does not, itself, imply a common purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">However the extent of control may be relevant evidence in determining whether such a common purpose existed at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">169 As I have previously observed, I do not consider that Toea's control of the Market premises, either alone or in conjunction with the other evidence, would justify the inference that either Toea or Mr Rosenlund shared a common purpose with any of the infringing stallholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">In any event, I am satisfied that it would have been virtually impossible for the respondents to control stallholders so as to prevent infringement, save in the case of the most blatant misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">In this case, the extent of the demonstrated misconduct by infringing stallholders was not such as to lead the respondents to the conclusion that there would be further infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">They were entitled to accept assurances given by infringing stallholders that they would not again infringe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">170 In the course of argument the applicant referred to three American cases concerning 'secondary' liability for trademark infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">Given the clear statement of principle in connection with tortious liability in Thompson v Australian Capital Television, I see no point in discussing those cases in this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">CONCLUSIONS 
 
171 I proceed upon the basis that, in order to hold the respondents liable for the stallholders' infringements, '... there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage', and that in order to satisfy that test in the present case, it is necessary to show that the respondents acted in concert with each stallholder in 'committing the tort' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">172 In my view it is simply impossible to reach that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">I accept Mr Rosenlund's evidence that he wished to deter stallholders from infringing trademarks and took steps to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">The primary infringing stallholders all understood that this was his position and therefore that of Toea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">The applicant's case hangs upon the assertion that he did not do enough, or could have done more, to deter infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">It is said that from this, I should infer that he was really encouraging the stallholders in their illegal activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">In other words, it is submitted that although there was no duty on the respondents to take steps to prevent infringement, the failure to do so evidenced an intention to encourage infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">That approach fails to take account of the fact that there may have been other reasons for not taking more draconian measures to prevent infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">In any event, I am unpersuaded that either of the respondents acted in common with any of the stallholders in the actions which constituted infringement of the applicant's copyrights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">I am also satisfied that such infringements were not committed in the execution of any common purpose shared with the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">As I have said, the respondents' purpose was to conduct an efficient and profitable Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">The purpose of each stallholder was the successful conduct of his or her stall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">There was no common purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">173 It follows that the application must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">I will hear submissions as to costs and any requests for further findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.</sentence>
