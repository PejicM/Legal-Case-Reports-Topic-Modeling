1 The Application presently before the Court seeks an order pursuant to s 17F(1) of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) confirming the Scheme for the transfer and amalgamation of the Australian insurance business of Budget Insurance Company Limited to Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Both of those insurers are the Applicants in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The Scheme to give effect to that transfer and amalgamation has been prepared in accordance with Part III , Division 3A of the 1973 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited is incorporated in Australia and has carried on general insurance business in Australia since July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 Budget Insurance Company Limited is incorporated in the United Kingdom and is registered as a foreign company in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It has carried on business in Australia since June 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It has, however, not issued any new contracts of insurance in Australia since 31 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It wishes to be relieved of its liabilities and obligations under and in respect of insurance policies that it has issued and underwritten and to have its authorisation to carry on general insurance business under the 1973 Act revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 All renewals and new business after 31 August 2005 has been written through Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 Both of the Applicant insurers are presently authorised to conduct general insurance business and both are subsidiaries of Budget Holdings Limited, a Guernsey corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">THE INSURANCE ACT AND SECTION 17F 
 
7 The " main object " of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) is set forth as follows in s 2A(1): 
 The main object of this Act is to protect the interests of policyholders and prospective policyholders under insurance policies (issued by general insurers and Lloyd's underwriters) in ways that are consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative insurance industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">8 Part III of the Act concerns the need to apply to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for an authorisation to carry on insurance business in Australia and further provides for those circumstances in which an authorisation may be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">9 Part III, Division 3A provides for the transfer and amalgamation of an insurance business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Of particular importance is s 17B which relevantly provides:
 Transfer or amalgamation of insurance business (1) No part of the insurance business of a general insurer may be: 
 
 (a) transferred to another general insurer; or 
 (b) amalgamated with the business of another general insurer; 
 
except under a scheme confirmed by the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">... (3) A scheme must set out: 
 
 (a) the terms of the agreement or deed under which the proposed transfer or amalgamation is carried out; and 
 (b) particulars of any other arrangements necessary to give effect to the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 

10 Section 17C sets out those steps which must be undertaken before an application may be " made " for confirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">For the purposes of s 17C, it is considered that an application for confirmation of a scheme is " made " at that point in time when a hearing is held which seeks confirmation and not at that point in time when proceedings are filed with this Court: Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 at [30] ---[37] per Lindgren J, [2004] FCA 524 ; 139 FCR 450 at 458---9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">See also: Calliden Group Limited in the matter of Calliden Group Limited [2007] FCA 2019 at [81] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">11 Section 17D provides that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority may arrange for an independent actuary to make a written report on a scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">12 Section 17E identifies those bodies corporate that may apply to this Court for confirmation and s 17F provides as follows for those orders which this Court may make, namely:
 Confirmation of scheme (1) The Federal Court may: 
 
 (a) confirm a scheme without modification; or 
 (b) confirm the scheme subject to such modifications as it thinks appropriate; or 
 (c) refuse to confirm the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
(2) The Federal Court may make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to reinsurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">When a scheme is confirmed, it becomes binding on all persons: s 17G.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">13 The discretion conferred by s 17F is conferred in general terms and does not specify any criteria to be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It must, however, be a discretion exercised in a manner which promotes the objects of the Act, including the protection of the interests of policy holders in ways consistent with " the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative insurance industry ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">A " critical consideration " is " whether affected policyholders will be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme ": PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [24] per Lindgren J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">14 Section 32 of the 1973 Act, it should further be noted, provides that the Authority may also determine " prudential standards " that must be complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Of immediate relevance to the present proceedings are three such standards, namely:
 
(i) Prudential Standard GPS 110 -- which deals with " Capital Adequacy " and aims to ensure that the security of policy holder obligations of all insurers is established at an appropriate level by requiring that each general insurer maintain at least a minimum amount of capital;
 
(ii) Prudential Standard GPS 310 -- which deals with audit and actuarial reporting and outlines the roles and responsibilities of a general insurer's Approved Actuary; and
 
(iii) Prudential Standard GPS 410 -- which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of the insurance business of a general insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Also of relevance is:
 
(iv) A " Prudential Practice Guide (Draft) " which deals with " Capital Adequacy " and " Capital Management ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">THE SCHEME 
 
15 The " Summary of the Scheme " in the present proceedings was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and sets out the effect of the Scheme as follows:
 Summary of scheme The following is a summary of the scheme: 
(a) All of the rights, liabilities and obligations of BIC under policies issued or underwritten by BIC in the conduct of BIC's Australian insurance business will be transferred to A&amp;G and become rights, liabilities and obligations of A&amp;G. BIC will be released and discharged from these liabilities and obligations and will cease to operate an insurance business in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">(b) A cash amount equal to the value of the liabilities assumed by A&amp;G (net of reinsurance and third party recoveries) will be transferred from BIC to A&amp;G. Reinsurance treaties held for the benefit of BIC will be assigned to A&amp;G.
 
(c) Except for A&amp;G being substituted for BIC as insurer, the transfer will not result in any change to policy benefits or policy terms and conditions under policies issued or underwritten by BIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">(d) The rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities of holders of policies issued by BIC in Australia will be the same as if those policies had been issued or underwritten by A&amp;G instead of BIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Claims under such policies are to be made to A&amp;G, instead of BIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">(e) BIC will bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer and the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">(f) The transfer will take effect on the first business day after the date on which the scheme is confirmed by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 The Transfer Agreement executed as between the two Applicant insurers is expressed to be subject to two conditions precedent, namely:
 
(i) the need for confirmation by this Court; and 
 
(ii) the making of a " go-ahead " decision pursuant to the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The latter condition was satisfied by a decision of a delegate of the Minister on 19 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It is now concluded that the Scheme should be confirmed without modification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">17 It has been concluded that the confirmation of the Scheme will not detrimentally affect either those policy holders whose policies are being transferred pursuant to the Scheme or those policy holders into whose funds the policies are being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Nor is there any other discretionary reason to refuse confirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">18 Pursuant to the terms of the Scheme , all of the liabilities and obligations of Budget Insurance Company Limited in respect to its policies are assumed by Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Scheme provides ( inter alia ) that " any person having a claim on or obligation to BIC in respect of a BIC Policy will have the same claim on or obligation to A&amp;G in substitution for the claim on or obligation to BIC irrespective of when the claim or obligation arose ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Scheme further provides for the transfer from Budget Insurance Company Limited to Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited of an amount being the quantum of all liabilities and obligations of the former company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">That amount is calculated at present to be an amount of $46,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">19 And the financial security of both existing policy holders of Budget Insurance Company Limited and the policy holders of Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited will not be prejudicially affected if the Scheme is confirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">20 Joint actuarial reports have been provided by Mr Timothy Andrews, a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries in Australia and employed by Finity Consulting Pty Limited, and a Mr Adam Payne, also a Fellow of the Institute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Mr Andrews is the Approved Actuary for Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">An actuarial report was provided as recently as 2 May 2008 and is based upon the unaudited quarterly returns provided to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as at 31 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">An earlier (but now updated) report relied upon the audited annual report as at 30 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The conclusion expressed in the May 2008 report is as follows:
 6.4 Conclusion On the basis of the APRA capital adequacy test at 31 March 2008, we are satisfied that the financial security of the policyholders of BIC and A&amp;G are protected under the terms of the proposed Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Our opinion is based on the actuarial assessment of the insurance liabilities of each company and the statement of assets set out in the APRA returns for each company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For BIC policyholders, whilst the protection provided by A&amp;G will be lower than is currently provided by BIC, it is important to recognise that --- 
&#8226; all else being equal, a larger insurer has less volatile results and thus can operate with a lower CAM whilst still offering the same level of financial protection
 
&#8226; the A&amp;G CAM at 31 March 2008 of 1.42 coupled with the terms of the General Services Agreement with AIH provides a substantial level of protection in its own right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Whilst difficult to assess precisely, there is only a remote possibility of there being insufficient funds to pay claims
 
&#8226; A&amp;G is profitable and expected to be able to fund its future capital requirements from retained earnings if its budgeted profit levels are achieved as noted in the FCR as at 30 June 2007
 
&#8226; almost all of the remaining outstanding BIC claims will be paid within 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">As such, it is the company's short term solvency projections which are most relevant and these are expected to be adequate
 
&#8226; the parent has indicated a commitment to support A&amp;G to ensure that the CAM remains above 1.30 and this commitment appears to be backed by an ability to provide that support
 
&#8226; we note that almost any transfer of liabilities will lead to a lower level of protection for at least one of the insurers involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The key issue is whether the likelihood of valid claims being paid is materially affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">We assess that A&amp;G provides a similar level of protection to policyholders as BIC to the extent that the likelihood of claims not being paid is remote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Those conclusions, it should be noted, have been based upon an assumption that none of the existing reinsurance of Budget Insurance Company Limited will be transferred to Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As a matter of fact, all reinsurers have been notified of the Scheme and a limited number indicated that they do not have objection to an assignment of the reinsurance contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">21 The conclusion of the actuaries is well supported by their prior analysis of the financial statements of both Applicant insurers prior to and subsequent to transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">One important matter to which consideration is given in the actuarial report is the " Capital Adequacy Multiple ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">That is a margin calculated pursuant to Prudential Standard GPS 110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Messrs Andrews and Payne helpfully define the terms employed in their report as follows:
 The Minimum Capital Requirement ("MCR") is the minimum amount required to meet APRA's capital adequacy standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It is a risk-based assessment ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The Capital Adequacy Multiple ("CAM") is the ratio of the Capital Base to the MCR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">At 30 June 2007, the CAM for each entity is slightly higher than 1.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">At 30 September 2007, the CAM for each entity was largely unchanged for A &amp; G but had reduced slightly to 1.26 for BIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Prudential Practice Guide issued by the Authority provides that it " envisages that an insurer's minimum target capital specified in its Business Plan would be at least ... 1.2 times MCR where its MCR exceeds $5 million ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">22 The actuaries address the Capital Adequacy of both insurers pre- and post- amalgamation as follows:

 Table 6.2 --- Capital Adequacy as at 31 March 2008 --- Pre- and Post-Transfer Pre-Transfer Transferred Post BIC A&amp;G to A&amp;G Transfer $000 $000 $000 $000 Total Investment Risk Charge 366 4,970 0 4,970 Asset Exposure Concentration Risk charge 1,359 0 0 0 Maximum Event Retention Risk Charge 0 1,500 0 1,500 OCP Insurance Risk Charge 4 1,670 4 1,674 Premium Liabilities Insurance Risk Charge 0 6,221 0 6,221 Minimum Capital Requirement 1 5000 14,361 4 14,365 Capital Base 6,619 20,381 0 20,381 Capital Surplus (Deficiency) 1,619 6,020 6,016 CAM 1.32 1.42 1.42 1 APRA'S minimum MCR of $5m applies to BIC 
It will be noted that the Capital Adequacy Multiple post-transfer remains projected at 1.42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">This multiple, Mr Andrews explained, was but one of the matters taken into account in reaching the ultimate conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">23 The actuarial report, however, goes on to sound the following caution: 
 6.2 Prospective Capital Adequacy We have not made any independent projections of the capital adequacy position beyond 31 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">However, we understand that A&amp;G intends to manage its capital in line with its Capital Management Plan which states that that [sic] A&amp;G will continue to retain earnings to ensure adequate capital coverage above a minimum target CAM of 1.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">We have been provided with projections undertaken by the company which show that the CAM is expected to remain above the target minimum of 1.30 provided A&amp;G meets its budgeted profit levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">These projections appear reasonable, however there is no guarantee that the assumptions on which the projections are based will be realised --- i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">it is possible for the CAM to vary materially from the expected position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">To address this concern, there were apparently discussions which resulted in the parent company, Budget Holdings Limited, writing what has been described as a " Letter of Support ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That letter from Budget Holdings Limited states that -- if required -- it will provide additional capital so that Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited will continue to maintain its minimum capital requirements and ensure that its Capital Adequacy Multiple does not fall below 1.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">24 The importance of Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited continuing to meet the prudential requirements set forth in Prudential Standard GPS 410 is such that consideration has been given to whether the Scheme should be confirmed -- but only subject to a modification to embrace as a term of the Scheme the commitment Budget Holdings Limited proffered in its " Letter of Support ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">25 Such a modification was opposed by both the Applicant insurers and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">That opposition was founded upon:
 
(i) the conclusion expressed in the joint actuarial report and the further assessment of the Approved Actuary in his oral evidence; 
 
(ii) the fact that the tail of the " run off insurance " for Budget Insurance Company Limited was limited to a period of about 12 months; 
 
(iii) the fact that any such modification may well expose Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited to a commercial disadvantage, namely a requirement to satisfy a " target " Capital Adequacy Multiple of 1.3 as opposed to that envisaged by the Authority, namely 1.2; and
 
(iv) the fact that in the Authority's assessment, Auto &amp; General Insurance Company Limited had demonstrated a continuing ability to meet the Capital Adequacy Multiple of 1.2, even though it had experienced a period of perhaps unexpected claims during the 2007 Newcastle storms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">That opposition, it is considered, is well-founded and no modification of the Scheme is considered warranted prior to confirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">PRUDENTIAL STANDARD GPS 410 AND THE ROLE OF THE AUTHORITY 
 
26 Section 17C(2) of the 1973 Act provides as follows:
 An application for confirmation of a scheme may not be made unless: (a) a copy of the scheme and any actuarial report on which the scheme is based have been given to APRA in accordance with the prudential standards; and (b) a notice of intention to make the application has been published by the applicant in accordance with the prudential standards; and (c) an approved summary of the scheme has been given to every affected policyholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">27 A copy of the Scheme has been provided to the Authority in accordance with s 17C(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">28 The Authority has no objection to this Court making an order for confirmation of the Scheme .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In a letter dated 2 May 2008 the Authority thus states:
 After due consideration of the relevant material including the additional actuarial report included in the affidavit of Timothy Edgeworth Andrews sworn 2 May 2008, APRA is satisfied that the Scheme, if confirmed, will provide an adequate level of protection for the policyholders of BIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I also note that the terms of the policies held by BIC policyholders will not change (other than the identity of the insurer changing from BIC to A&amp;G) and that claims handling procedures will continue as before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I therefore advise that APRA has no objection to the applicants seeking an order for confirmation of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">29 The manner in which this Court exercises the discretion conferred by s 17F(1) is informed and assisted by the views expressed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">This Court has long recognised the role played by the Authority and the reliance placed by the Court upon its review of the proposed scheme and its assessment as to whether or not it should oppose an order seeking confirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Albeit in the comparable context of a transfer under Part 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) , in Colonial Portfolio Services Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [1999] FCA 1779 , Mathews J observed:
 [28] It is relevant to note that APRA, which operates as something of a watchdog in relation to transfers under Pt 9 of the Act, had no objection to the confirmation of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Nor did APRA arrange for an actuarial report on the scheme, as it is entitled to do under s 192 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It can be inferred that APRA regarded the reports furnished by the applicants as adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">... Like comments have also been made in other cases: Re Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 at [23] , [2000] FCA 1259 ; 104 FCR 37 at 40 per Katz J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">See also: Application of Zurich Insurance Company and Converium Limited [2003] FCA 1519 at [4] per Hely J; Application of Advance Life Insurance Limited (Unreported, FCA, Sheppard J, 18 February 1997).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">30 The conclusion that the Scheme should be confirmed in the present proceedings has been likewise assisted by the views expressed by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">THE ROLE OF ACTUARIES AND THE APPROVED ACTUARY 
 
31 The manner in which this Court exercises the discretion conferred by s 17F(1) of the Insurance Act is also necessarily informed by the evidence placed before it, in particular the evidence of actuaries and the evidence of an insurer's Approved Actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">32 Section 49K of the 1973 Act provides as follows:
 Actuary's role (1) The actuary of a general insurer appointed in accordance with section 39 must: (a) perform for the insurer the functions of an actuary set out in the prudential standards; and (b) prepare, and give to the insurer, the reports (if any) required by the prudential standards to be prepared by the actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">(2) The general insurer must make the arrangements that are necessary to enable the actuary to do those things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">(3) The reports that the prudential standards require the actuary to prepare must deal with all of the matters required by the prudential standards to be dealt with in the reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">33 And Prudential Standard GPS 310 also relevantly provides in part as follows: 
 [25] In addition to and without derogation from the role of an Approved Actuary as provided for under the Act, an Approved Actuary's primary roles are to provide advice on the valuation of an insurer's insurance liabilities and to provide an impartial assessment of the overall financial condition of the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">An insurer may also seek the advice of its Approved Actuary in relation to other matters where the insurer considers this to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">34 The independence of actuaries (including consultant actuaries) and the responsibilities imposed in particular upon the Approved Actuary by the Act and the Standards are matters upon which this Court can rightly place considerable reliance when exercising the discretion conferred by s 17F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">35 The manner in which the discretion is to be exercised in the present proceedings has obviously been largely informed by both the facts set forth in the joint report prepared by Messrs Andrews and Payne and also the professional assessments they have made based upon those facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
36 The procedural requirements imposed by s 17C and Prudential Standard GPS 410 are of fundamental importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">They are designed to ensure that affected policy holders are both informed of the scheme which is being proposed and given adequate information such that they can make a decision as to whether or not they wish to support or oppose that scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The steps to be undertaken have helpfully been summarised by Jacobson J in SGIC General Insurance Limited [2004] FCA 1639 at [18] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">37 In addition to requiring that a copy of the scheme and any actuarial reports are to be provided to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Prudential Standard GPS 410 also imposes obligations as to the need for a Notice of Intention to be published and for an approved summary of the scheme to be given to every affected policy holder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Standard also requires that a copy of the scheme be available for inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">38 In accordance with that Standard , the Authority has approved the Notice of Intention , the list of newspapers in which the Notice has been published, and the locations in each of the States and Territories where copies of the Scheme have been made available for inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The Authority has also approved the " Scheme Summary " .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
39 The Scheme has been advertised as required and has also been available for inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">40 Specific reference should be made to s 17C(2)(c) of the 1973 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">That provision requires that an approved summary of the scheme must be given to every affected policy holder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Section 17C(5), however, further provides as follows: 
 The Federal Court may dispense with the need for compliance with paragraph (2)(c) in relation to a particular scheme if it is satisfied that, because of the nature of the scheme or the circumstances attending its preparation, it is not necessary that the paragraph be complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">On 4 March 2008, Branson J made orders pursuant to s 17C(5) dispensing with the need for compliance with s 17C(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The orders as made by Her Honour, namely requiring that copies of the approved summary of the Scheme be provided to those persons identified in the order, have been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">41 All procedural requirements which are to be satisfied prior to confirmation of the Scheme , it is considered, have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">CONCLUSION 
 
42 It is considered that the Scheme should be confirmed without modification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">ORDERS 
 
43 The Orders of the Court are:
