 Background 
 
1 The hearing of this matter commenced on the first court-sitting day after the first anniversary of the filing of the applicants' original Application on 13 September 2007, although it may be noted that the second respondent was only added as a party to the proceedings on 29 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 In paragraph 1 of the Application filed 13 September 2007 a declaration was sought as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">A declaration that the documents and other materials seized by Australian Federal Police agents at the premises of the Applicants pursuant to two search warrants each issued under section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) by J Karam and dated 30 July 2007 contain: 
 
 
 
 (a) communications the subject of legal professional privilege; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) documents and other materials outside the scope of the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">' 
 
 


 
3 Most of the ensuing twelve months was devoted to the identification of communications which were the subject of legal professional privilege claims, the basis on which privilege was claimed and the first respondent's responses to those claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">As it transpires all of the claims of privilege were resolved between the parties without the necessity for the Court's intervention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 Once those issues were resolved, the only substantive matter which remained related to documents and other materials which had been seized and which were said to fall outside the scope of the warrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 On the first return date the first respondent gave an undertaking to the Court that he would not undertake any forensic examination of the images taken from the hard disks that had been seized on 31 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That undertaking was progressively extended up to and including 15 September 2008 or further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It has now been extended up to and including judgment on the Further Amended Application filed 29 August 2008, which is presently before the Court, or further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The character of the matter has changed quite significantly in recent times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 27 May 2008 an Amended Application was filed and on 29 August 2008 a Further Amended Application was filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In the Further Amended Application J Karam was named as the second respondent, he being the Justice in and for the State of New South Wales located at The Downing Centre Local Court who issued the two search warrants on 30 July 2007 which were executed on 31 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">7 The search warrants were issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ('the Crimes Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">That section made provision for the issue of warrants in relation to premises and warrants in relation to persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This case concerns two warrants in relation to premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Relevantly, s 3E provided as follows:
 '3E (1) ... ... (5) If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant: (a) the offence to which the warrant relates; and (b) a description of the premises to which the warrant relates ...; and (c) the kinds of evidential material that are to be searched for under the warrant; and (d) the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and (e) the time at which the warrant expires (see subsection (5A)); and (f) whether the warrant may be executed at any time or only during particular hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">(5A) The time stated in the warrant under paragraph 3E(5)(e) as the time at which the warrant expires must be a time that is not later than the end of the seventh day after the day on which the warrant is issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">(6) The issuing officer is also to state, in a warrant in relation to premises: (a) that the warrant authorises the seizure of a thing (other than evidential material of the kind referred to in paragraph (5)(c)) found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be: (i) evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or (ii) a thing relevant to another offence that is an indictable offence; or (iii) evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 ) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act); if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the thing is necessary to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction or its use in committing an offence; and (b) whether the warrant authorises an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person who is at or near the premises when the warrant is executed if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">...' 

 The search warrants 
 
8 The search warrants which were issued by the second respondent on 30 July 2007 were expressed in substantially the same terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The primary difference related to the identification of the premises at which the searches were to be undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In one case the search warrant related to the home of the second and third applicants at 2 Silex Road, Mosman, NSW ('Mosman').</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the other case the relevant premises were those of the first applicant at 119/26-32 Pirrama Road, Pyrmont NSW ('Pyrmont').</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The other difference was, perhaps as a result of an inadvertent oversight, that in the Pyrmont warrant the names '&#8226; Linda DANIEL' and '&#8226; PKF Vanuatu' were included (twice), after the name '&#8226; Lynda MEEK', under the heading 'SECOND CONDITION', whereas in the Mosman warrant these two names did not appear at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">One suspects that the two pages bearing the number '3' in the search warrants became transposed at some stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is no issue in these proceeding as to whether the transposition, if there was one, occurred before or after the warrants were issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 It is common ground that, at all material times, the second applicant, who is the wife of the third applicant, was the sole director and shareholder of the first applicant, although the first respondent has reserved the right to argue that the third applicant was in fact a shadow director of the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 The search warrant for Mosman was as follows:
 " COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
 CRIMES ACT 1914 : Section 3E

11 Whilst Rebecca Lauren Miller was named as the executing officer in the Mosman and Pyrmont search warrants, it would appear that at about 4:35pm on 30 July 2007 she effected a substitution of Miguel Luis Serrano for herself as executing officer in the Pyrmont warrant by inserting his name in lieu of her own, initialling and dating it and recording the time '1635hrs', whereupon Mr Serrano would appear to have recorded his initials against his name and inserted the same date and time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The offences to which the search warrants related 
 
12 The offences to which each of the warrants related were expressed to be those specified in the 'third condition'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">13 Section 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Criminal Code '), to which reference was made in the search warrants provided as follows:
 '134.2(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: (a) the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains a financial advantage from another person; and (b) the other person is a Commonwealth entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 
 (2) Absolute liability applies to the paragraph (1)(b) element of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 


 
14 Section 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code , to which reference was also made, relevantly provided as follows:
 '400.4(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: (a) the person deals with money or other property; and (b) either: (i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or (ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and (c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Penalty: Imprisonment for 20 years, or 1200 penalty units, or both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 

 
 Section 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code , which was referred to in the search warrants, provided in relation to conspiracy:
 
 
 
 ' 11.5(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">' 
 
 


 
15 Section 400.4 of the Criminal Code fell within Part 10.2 which bore the heading ' Money laundering ' (see ss400.1 - 400.16).</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">16 In s 400.1(1) the expression 'deals with money or other property', which appears in s 400.4(1)(a), was defined to have 'the meaning given by section 400.2'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Relevantly, for present purposes s 400.2 of the Criminal Code provided:
 
 
 
 '400.2(1) For the purposes of this Division, a person deals with money or other property if: 
 
 
 
(a) the person does any of the following: (i) receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; (ii) imports money or other property into, or exports money or other property from, Australia; (iii) engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property; and (b) the money or other property is proceeds of crime, or could become an instrument of crime, in relation to an offence that is: (i) a Commonwealth indictable offence; or (ii) a foreign indictable offence; or (iii) a State indictable offence; or (iv) an Australian Capital Territory indictable offence; or (v) a Northern Territory indictable offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">' 

 
17 In s 400.1(1) of the Criminal Code ' proceeds of crime ' was defined to mean:
 '... any money or other property that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)' 

 
In the same subsection ' instrument of crime ' was defined as follows:
 '... money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)' 

 The Further Amended Application 
 
18 The substantive relief sought by the applicants in the Further Amended Application filed 29 August 2008 was as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">A declaration that the two search warrants purportedly issued under section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ("the Crimes Act " ) by the Second Respondent and dated 30 July 2007 ('the search warrants") were invalid for the reason that the Third Condition of the warrants failed to specify the alleged offence or offences with sufficient particularity, specified an offence or offences not known to the law, or failed to disclose the nature of the offence or offences so as to indicate the area of the search or set the bounds to the area of the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">A declaration that the documents and other materials seized by Australian Federal Police agents at the premises of the Applicants pursuant to the search warrants each issued under section 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) by J Karam and dated 30 July 2007 ('the search warrants') contain: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) communications the subject of legal professional privilege; and 
 
 (b) documents and other material outside the scope of the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>

<sentence id="s56">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A declaration that the First Respondent, his officers, employees, servants and agents, are not, and each of them is not, entitled to use the communications and documents and other materials referred to in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) and 3 above .</sentence>

 ...' 
 


 
19 It may be observed that until the filing of the Further Amended Application on 29 August 2008 there was no challenge to the lawfulness of the two search warrants as issued by the second respondent on 30 July 2007 (see the deletions from prayers for relief numbered 2 and 3, which were previously numbered 1 and 2, and the newly inserted prayer for relief 1 which included, for the first time, the expression 'purportedly issued under section 3E ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Execution of the search warrants

<sentence id="s71">Another member of the Mosman team was a member of the Australian Federal Police's computer forensic team, Michael Banach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">24 The search warrants contemplated action being taken by the relevant executing officer and also by 'constables assisting'.</sentence>

 Sperling: 'Is there anywhere in particular where --- like do you have an office in the house or --- or a room where --- where the majority of these items would be located, things for the business?</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 
 
 Clarissa Mattingly: 'Um, I think um, they would be upstairs in um, I call it the --- the um, the study with the computer equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">' 
 
 Miller: 'Sure' 
 
 Clarissa Mattingly: 'So they should be all there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">....' 
 
30 When cross-examined about her involvement in the execution of the Mosman warrant Federal Agent Rebecca Miller gave the following evidence which referred to her conversation with Clarissa Mattingly to which reference has been made:
 
 Robertson SC: '... What I want to put to you is that when you were involved in executing the warrant at the Mosman premises on 31 July 2007 the only part of the third condition of the warrant that you took into account was the periods of time in the third condition?</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 
 Miller: 'In relation to things seized on the day that relate to the third condition, I took into consideration the contents of the material would relate to the offences specified, being tax evasion and money laundering, with consideration to the dates of the alleged offences being committed during that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' 
 
 Robertson SC: 'But, Ms Miller, without a keyword search of the computer equipment at the Mosman premises, what I suggest to you is that you had no basis for thinking that there was any such material on that computer equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Do you agree with that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">' 
 
 Miller: 'Based on a number of elements that form my belief, part of those, or one of those elements, was that Ms Mattingly said that things would be found in relation to the warrant, upstairs in the study with the computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">' 
 
31 The property in issue in these proceedings, which came from Mosman, consists of:
 
(a) the Seagate hard drive to which reference has been made, and
 
(b) a TALON copy made by Mr Banach at Mosman on 31 July 2007 of a Western Digital hard drive (a second hard drive) which was located inside the same Dell Mini Tower P/C at Mosman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">32 The Seagate hard drive was removed from Mosman and taken to the first respondent's office in Sydney where it was imaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Following the imaging of the Seagate hard drive, the Seagate hard drive was itself returned to Mosman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">33 The first respondent is presently in possession of the image of the Seagate hard drive made at Police Headquarters in Sydney from the Seagate hard drive and also the TALON copy of the Western Digital hard drive made by Mr Banach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Western Digital hard drive was not itself removed from Mosman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">34 A distinction is to be drawn between 'imaging' and 'copying'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">What has been described as the TALON 'copy' of the Western Digital hard drive is more accurately described as an image of that hard drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">An image of a hard drive is a 'bit-stream' copy of the whole hard drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">A bit-stream copy or image will take data from every part of a drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">35 'Imaging' amounts to forensic copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It captures current data, data which has been deleted and spare disk space.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">'Copying' is the word commonly used to describe the making of a copy of a file or a folder which you might see within a software program such as 'Windows Explorer'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">36 When he was at Mosman on 31 July 2007, Mr Fox gave an instruction to Mr Banach to image the Dell PC i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">the Seagate hard drive (item (a)) and the Western Digital hard drive referred to in item (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">This instruction was given before Mr Banach operated the Dell PC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">37 At no time on 31 July 2007 did Mr Banach perform a key word search on the Seagate hard drive (item (a)) or the Western Digital hard drive referred to in item (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">A key word search involves the use of a software program such as 'Microsoft Find' which would locate any file or folder in the relevant hard drive containing the key word that had been entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Relevantly for this case, a key word search might involve entering one of the names stated in the 'SECOND CONDITION' in the search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">38 Before attempting to image the Seagate hard drive (item (a)) and the Western Digital hard drive referred to in item (b) Mr Banach 'looked at the Dell computer and noticed that it was powered on'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">By clicking on 'My Computer' he was able to identify which hard disk drives were in the computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">39 Between 11:03am and 12:02pm on 31 July 2007 Mr Banach effected the image capture of the Western Digital hard drive referred to in item (b) thereby creating the TALON copy (item (b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">40 Mr Banach proceeded to set the TALON device to image the Seagate hard drive (item (a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">At 12:10pm he commenced the imaging process in respect of that hard drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">At 2:36pm Mr Banach noted that the TALON screen showed 'jumbled and abnormal output' which caused him to believe that the image was corrupted and that there must have been an error in the operation of the equipment used for the copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Conversation ensued between Federal Agent Rebecca Miller and Mr Banach as follows:
 
 Banach: 'The copy of the 250GB hard drive may be corrupted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">' 
 
 Miller: 'You'll have to take another copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">How long will that take?</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">' 
 
 
 Banach: 'It will take another couple of hours because this one had already been going for two or two and a half hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">' 
 Miller: 'Mrs Mattingly says she needs to pick her kids up from school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">She won't want to wait another two or so hours while that's going.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">' 
 

 Thereupon Mr Banach seized the Seagate hard drive, handed it to Federal Agent Gordon and proceeded to return to the Sydney headquarters of the Australian Federal Police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">41 During the course of the execution of the Mosman warrant on 31 July 2007 Federal Agent Rebecca Miller had a conversation with Mr Banach the detail of which she cannot now recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">She did, however, form the belief that the computers which had been identified by the second applicant as being in the upstairs study might contain evidentiary material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">She had previously seen emails and other electronically created documents which had been seized following the execution of a search warrant conducted on the premises of Owen T Daniel &amp; Co which:
 '42.1.1 were apparently to and received from Mrs Mattingly 42.1.2 referred to an 'Andrew', who I believed to be Mr Mattingly [the third applicant].</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">42.1.3 used the subject line of 'Centurion', which is one of the target bank accounts used in the round robin scheme of Operation Starlifter and is listed as an entity in the second condition of the warrant; 42.1.4 included Profit and Loss statements which had apparently been produced using a computer; 42.1.5 itemised memoranda of Professional service fees from companies such as Edgecumbe and PKF or other entities listed in the second condition of the warrant which appeared to charge fees for the transmission of emails;' 
42 Federal Agent Miller's evidence also included the following:
 
 
 '48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">During the search I had been shown documents apparently found in the upstairs study which purported to be invoices for "consultancy fees", which itemised "emails" as part of their services; 
 
 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">During the search I had been shown documents apparently found in the upstairs study which purported to be methods of payment forms listing entities from the second condition of the warrant which appeared to be created using a computer; and 
 
 50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">During the search I had been shown documents apparently found in the upstairs study which purported to be tax returns which appeared to be created using a computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">' 
 


 
43 Mr Banach deposed to a conversation with Federal Agent Fox in which Federal Agent Fox said:
 'There is relevant evidence on the Dell PC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Can you please make an image of it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">' 

 
44 After having the conversation with Federal Agent Fox in which those words were spoken Mr Banach had the belief that the Dell PC (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">the Seagate hard drive (item (a))) and the Western Digital hard drive referred to in item (b) would contain relevant evidence which fitted the three conditions of the Mosman search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">45 On 30 July 2007 Federal Agent Fox had attended an operational briefing conducted by Federal Agents Miller and Phun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Information was provided to those present which suggested that the applicants were involved in a round-robin transaction scheme which was being investigated as part of 'Operation Starlifter' which itself involved an investigation into the chartered accounting firm known as Owen T Daniel &amp; Co and 19 of that firm's clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">46 Federal Agent Fox instructed Mr Banach to image the relevant hard drives as he held the belief that evidential material would be contained on the drives of the computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">His reasons for holding such a belief were stated as follows:
 
 
 '20.1 By reason of my previous involvement in the execution of the Operation Starlifter search warrants, I was aware that it was a common modus operandi for the participants of the scheme, namely promoters and clients, to communicate with clients by way of email; and 
 
 20.2 Through my discussions with Federal Agent Rebecca Miller in the period leading up to the execution of the search warrant, I was aware of the following: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that email correspondence between OTD [Owen T Daniel &amp; Co] and Clarissa Mattingly [the second applicant] , of Different Solutions [the first applicant] , had been seized in hardcopy form during the search warrant executed on the premises of OTD; and 
 
 (b) that the email correspondence between OTD and Clarissa Mattingly seized during the search warrant executed on the premises of OTD included communications regarding the transactions and entities being investigated as part of Operation Starlifter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">' 
 
 


 The Pyrmont premises 
 
47 The property seized at Pyrmont on 31 July 2007 was detailed on a number of 'PROPERTY SEIZURE RECORD' forms bearing serial nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">A133572, A133573, A133574, A133575 and A133576.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">48 On 31 July 2007 Federal Agent Rebecca Miller purported to appoint a number of persons, who were not constables, as constables assisting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">One such person was Josephine Balen, a Compliance Officer in the Australian Taxation Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">49 When engaged in the search and seizure of material at Pyrmont, Ms Balen identified a CD in a drawer which was labelled 'Payment Summary Report 1/7/04-30/6/05' ('the CD') which was seized on 31 July 2007 and placed in an Australian Federal Police evidence bag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">50 The property seized apparently included originals or copies of accounting records, tax records, cheque butts, invoices, bank statements, handwritten notes, wages records, cash flow records, company minutes, correspondence and other documents along with the CD seized by Ms Balen, another CD, a Lacie external hard drive marked 00140706180600C353U253, another Seagate external hard drive, two Hewlett Packard PC hard drives serial numbers TW01901007 and TW02508427 and a Dell Power Edge Server 4VVRFIS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">51 The documents included some in which Owen T Daniel was mentioned, along with the first applicant and/or the second applicant and/or the third applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">52 The property in issue in these proceedings, which came from Pyrmont, consists of:
 
 (c) the Dell Power Edge Server to which reference has been made and which has been referred to in the proceedings as 'REX',
 
 (d) a 500GB Lacie external hard drive device said to have been connected to REX and which I presume to be the Lacie external hard drive to which reference has been made, 
 
 (e) two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras, which I assume to be the two Hewlett Packard hard drives to which reference has been made, and 
 
 (f) the CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">53 Each of the Dell server, the Lacie external hard drive device and the two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras were removed from Pyrmont and taken to the first respondent's office in Sydney where they were imaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Following the imaging, they were returned to Pyrmont.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">54 The CD remains in the possession of the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">55 Shortly before 9:09am on 31 July 2007 Mr Bruce accessed the Dell server (item (c)) to determine how many drives or other sources of data were connected or associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He observed that it was physically connected to the Lacie hard drive (item (d)) and also a Seagate hard drive (not to be confused with item (a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">56 At about 9:09am Mr Bruce commenced a key word search of 'computer disk volume labelled as 'Archive' connected to the server named 'Rex''.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He electronically located files for the search term 'Owen T Daniel' on an external drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Because of the complicated cabling connected to the server, Mr Bruce couldn't discern which external drive --- the Lacie (item (d)) or the Seagate hard drive --- was the one which was identified as 'Archive' electronically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">57 Mr Bruce conducted a superficial search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">He considered that any hits which fell within the three conditions of the Pyrmont search warrant would indicate the likelihood of evidentiary material being stored on the server and its attached drivers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">58 The way the server was set up led Mr Bruce to form the belief that it would not be practicable to copy the server and the drives attached to it other than at the Australian Federal Police's Sydney headquarters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">59 Mr Bruce had assisted in the execution of five search warrants as part of Operation Starlifter prior to 31 July 2007 and was aware of the nature of the Operation Starlifter investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He had also been provided with a copy of the Standard Tactical Plan for Operation Starlifter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In this context, he formed the opinion that the data contained within the 'Archive' drive fell within the three conditions of the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">60 Mr Bruce proceeded to say to Federal Agent Serrano words to the effect 'I have found files matching the keywords that I'd searched for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' He identified the key words as being 'Owen T Daniel'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">61 At about midday Mr Bruce became aware that two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras had been discovered at Pyrmont in a box behind the staircase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He formed the view that they had previously been part of the network connected via the Dell server but had since been 'retired'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">62 On the basis that computer equipment is generally 'retired' every three years, Mr Bruce formed the belief that the two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras (item (e)) would have been part of the office network associated with the Dell server in the time period covered by the third condition of the Pyrmont search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">He considered that it would not be practicable to copy the two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras at the Pyrmont premises because they were likely to contain old and deleted data, the search and recovery of which, for the purposes of copying, was considered to be a complicated and slow process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">63 Mr Bruce's involvement in Operation Starlifter was such that he had an understanding that it was targeting Owen T Daniel &amp; Co Chartered Accountants and 19 of that firm's clients in relation to tax fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">64 Federal Agent Serrano had a similar understanding in respect of Operation Starlifter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He attended a briefing on 30 July 2007 in relation to the first applicant's apparent involvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">65 During the course of the morning on 31 July 2007 Federal Agent Serrano conducted an interview with Michelle Forrester, the first applicant's Financial Services Officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">During the course of the interview Ms Forrester was shown a number of handwritten notes which had been found in the 'disposal bin'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Ms Forrester described the notes as being 'from a board meeting that I have typed up'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">When asked where she typed up the notes her response was:
 'I would've typed them I think it's into my Outlook or into an email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">So it's in Outlook regardless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">' 

 
Later an A4 sized spiral detached page containing handwriting was shown to Ms Forrester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">She identified the handwriting as being 'my notes from my meeting with Kevin [referring to the first applicant's accountant, Kevin Zerafa] and other internal events'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Ms Forrester confirmed that she had typed up notes in her Outlook in respect of the manuscript notes which had been shown to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">66 Mr Serrano gave evidence that Ms Forrester's responses confirmed his belief that the electronic equipment identified at Pyrmont contained material which fell within the three conditions of the Pyrmont search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">In relation to the hard drives which were seized at Pyrmont, Federal Agent Serrano's evidence was that at the time when they were seized he had formed a belief that they contained information which fell within the conditions of the Pyrmont search warrant and information which was no longer available on the server.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">He gave evidence that his belief was founded upon the following:
 
 
 '39.1 I had been informed during the briefing by Federal Agent Miller that emails and other electronically created documents which related to Different Solutions Pty Ltd and/or the Mattinglys had been seized during the execution of the warrant at the premises of OTD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 
 39.2 The conversation referred to in paragraph 36 above [see [65] above] , which made it clear that the company stored minutes of meetings, and probably other relevant documents, electronically and not in hard copy format; 
 
 39.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Different Solutions IT person had informed me that the hard drives 'backed-up' the server in case it crashed; 
 
 39.4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">As the server was 'backed up' on external hard drives correspondence, meeting notes and other files of evidentiary value, that may have since removed (sic) from the server, may have still been stored on the external hard drives; 
 
 39.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The fact that we had formed a belief that the server may have been tampered with by somebody externally earlier that morning with the intention of trying to destroy evidence added value to the external hard drives as they may have contained evidence unable to be retrieved from the server.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 
 39.6 My knowledge of the nature of the Different Solutions Pty Ltd business, being web design, which strongly suggested that the company would use electronic means to create and store documents; and 
 
 39.7 During the search I had been shown copies of documents which appeared to be electronically created, such as computer generated financial records and balance sheets for Different Solutions Pty Ltd.' 
 


 
67 It should be noted that I have attempted to reconcile the Property Seizure Records with the table of items which is set out in paragraph 11 of the applicants' written submissions filed 2 September 2008 which is said to record the items which remain in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Insofar as I may have misread serial numbers it should be understood that I have endeavoured to identify the relevant items of property listed in the Property Seizure Records which have been referred to in the relevant table, with the applicants' description thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Hereafter I will endeavour to refer to the items in issue as the items identified by me above as (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The subsequent charges 
 
68 Shortly before the Application was amended and then further amended, two Court Attendance Notices were served upon the second applicant on 30 April 2008 calling for her attendance at the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on 3 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The first Court Attendance Notice related to an alleged offence between 3 February 2003 and 10 October 2006 under s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The offence was described as 'Deal in Proceeds of Crime --- Money or Property worth $100,000 or more', the short particulars of which were described as 'Clarissa Elizabeth Mattingly, through an entity trading as Different Solutions, did deal with money worth $100,000 or more and that money was an instrument of a crime'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">69 The second Court Attendance Notice served upon the second applicant alleged four separate offences of 'Obtaining Financial Advantage by Deception' under s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The first such offence was alleged to have been committed between about 1 July 2002 and 11 May 2004, the second between about 1 July 2003 and 27 May 2005, the third between about 1 July 2004 and 18 July 2006 and the fourth between about 1 July 2005 and 26 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The four offences alleged were said to relate to income tax returns for the financial years ended 30 June 2003, 30 June 2004, 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The 'Short Particulars' in each case were to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In respect of the 30 June 2003 year the 'Short Particulars' were as follows:
 'Clarissa Elizabeth Mattingly, through an entity trading as Different Solutions, did by a deception dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from another person, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, which is a Commonwealth entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Particulars of the deception Submitted an income tax return for the financial year ended 30 June 2003 which contained false company expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Particulars of the financial advantage Did not pay any tax on income that would normally be taxable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">' 
70 The Court Attendance Notices referrable to the second applicant were stamped by the Downing Centre Local Court as received on 2 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">71 In relation to the third applicant two Court Attendance Notices were also served upon him on 30 April 2008 alleging in the first case an offence under s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code and in the second case four separate offences under s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The several offences particularised mirrored those referred to in the two Court Attendance Notices served upon the second applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">72 The Court Attendance Notices directed to the third applicant were also endorsed by the Downing Centre Local Court as having been received on 2 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The Standard Tactical Plan for Operation Starlifter 
 
73 In respect of Operation Starlifter the Australian Federal Police's 'Standard Tactical Plan', which had been drafted by Federal Agent Phun with the collaboration of Federal Agent Rebecca Miller, included the following:
 '1.1 General Outline This matter relates to an investigation into tax evasion and money laundering of over $100 million dollars by Australian companies and Overseas Promoter based in Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">1.2 Background The Australian Taxation Office has been looking into scheme activity involving Australian residents and foreign tax havens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A primary focus has been the country of Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It is a low tax jurisdiction and Australia does not have a double tax agreement with this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The ATO identified what appeared to be 'round robin' transactions involving 19 taxpayers who were all clients of the one tax agent, Owen T Daniel &amp; Co, located at 30 Burwood Road, Burwood NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Audits have been conducted on three taxpayers who were clients of Owen T Daniel &amp; Co.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It was identified that all of the foreign companies involved in the round robin were owned or controlled by Robert Francis AGIUS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He is an ex-pat Australian now resident in Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He is a partner of the accounting firm PKF Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">AGIUS has been identified as the promoter of these arrangements and frequently travels to Australia to meet with clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">1.3 Outline of Scheme The scheme is basically a round robin, where funds are transferred out of the bank accounts of Australian resident companies to a bank account in New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The form of the payment is usually for "consulting fees" but can also include "insurance premiums" and "interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">These payments are claimed as tax deductions in the tax returns of resident Australian companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">A few days after the initial fund transfer to New Zealand the funds are invariably transferred back to the Australian taxpayer from a separate New Zealand bank account as "loans".</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">This amount is deposited into the Australian bank accounts of either the original company or to the owner and controller of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The New Zealand bank accounts are all controlled by the partners of PKF Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The accounts are in the name of companies incorporated in non tax haven companies (sic) such as the UK, USA and Ireland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">These companies are also controlled by the partners of PKF Vanuatu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The primary reason for the arrangement is to reduce the tax payable by the Australian resident company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Some arrangements also have the secondary benefit of getting the company profits to the directors in a tax free manner.</sentence>

82 It may be assumed that computers are the kind of electronic equipment to which s 3L is primarily directed (per Branson J in Kennedy v Baker [2004] FCA 562 ; (2004) 135 FCR 520 ('Kennedy v Baker') at [56]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">83 In s 3C of the Crimes Act a series of expressions and words are defined for the purposes of Part IAA of the Act which includes ss 3C --- 3ZX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">84 Relevantly for present purposes, the following expressions and words were defined in s 3C(1):
 '3C(1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 ... 
 data includes: 
 (a) information in any form; or 
 (b) any program (or part of a program).</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">
 
 data held in a computer includes: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) data held in any removable data storage device for the time being held in a computer; or 
 (b) data held in a data storage device on a computer network of which the computer forms a part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 
 
 
 
 
 data storage device means a thing containing, or designed to contain, data for use by a computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 
 evidential material means a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence, including such a thing in electronic form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">
 ...' 
 


 
85 The term 'data' is used as a singular collective noun in the sense of a mass or body of characters or symbols constituting information capable of being processed into accessible form by electronic equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">A computer file is a subset of a larger body of data (per Branson J in Kennedy v Baker at [56] and [62]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">86 In s 3(1) of the Crimes Act other words and expressions were defined including 'thing relevant to an indictable offence' and 'thing relevant to a summary offence'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In respect of the former, s 3(1) relevantly provided:
 '3(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 ... 
 
 thing relevant to an indictable offence means: 
 
 (a) either of the following: 
 
 
(i) anything with respect to which an indictable offence against any law of the Commonwealth ... has been committed or is suspected, on reasonable grounds to have been committed; 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (b) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; or 
 
 (c) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">' 
 
 


 
87 It may be observed that s 3L(1A) and s 3L(2) draw a distinction between copying and taking data by means of a device brought to the premises by the executing officer or constable assisting, on the one hand, and seizure of equipment containing data, on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">As French J (as his Honour then was), Sackville and R D Nicholson JJ said in Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384 at [87] :
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The statute draws a distinction between the seizure of a thing from the premises and the taking away of a thing brought on to the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The corollary of this distinction is that information in electronic form downloaded onto a device brought on[to] the premises is not treated as itself the subject of "seizure".</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">' 

 
88 In relation to things seized under a warrant, s 3Q of the Crimes Act relevantly provided:
 
 
 '3Q(1) If a thing is seized under a warrant ... the executing officer or a constable assisting must provide a receipt for the thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 (2) If 2 or more things are seized or moved, they may be covered in the one receipt.</sentence>

89 The Revised Explanatory Memorandum circulated by authority of the Minister for Justice and Customs in respect of the Cybercrime Bill 2001 included in respect of the proposed amendments to s 3L of the Crimes Act the following under the heading ' Item 8 ': 
 'This Item amends subsection 3L(1) of the Crimes Act and inserts new subsections 3L(1A) and 3L(1B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Proposed subsection 3L(1) would clarify that the existing power to operate electronic equipment on premises to find evidential material includes material physically located away from the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">... As most business computers are networked to other desktop computers and to central storage computers, files physically held on one computer are often accessible from another computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">In some cases these computer networks can extend across different office locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Accordingly, it is critical that law enforcement officers executing a search warrant are able to search not only material on computers located on the search premises but also material accessible from those computers but located elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Proposed subsection 3L(1A) would enable law enforcement officers executing a search warrant to copy data held on any electronic equipment or associated devices at search premises to a storage device where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the data contains evidential material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This will permit officers to copy all data held on a computer hard drive or data storage device if some of the data contains evidential material or if there are reasonable grounds to suspect the data contains evidential material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The existing provision [see s 3L(2)(c)] only allows evidential material to be copied ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Electronic equipment, such as a computer hard drive, can hold large amounts of data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">It is often not practicable for officers to search all the data for evidential material while at the search premises and to then copy only the evidential material which is found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The proposed provision would allow officers to copy all the data on a piece of electronic equipment (by imaging a computer hard drive for example) in situations where an initial search of the data uncovers some evidential material or where the officer believes on reasonable grounds that the equipment might contain evidential material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">...' (Emphasis added) 

 
90 The reference to 'reasonable grounds' in the penultimate paragraph quoted above is consistent with the reference to 'reasonable grounds' in what is now s 3L(1A).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It may be noted that the form of clause 3L(1A) as contained in the Cybercrime Bill 2001 was the same as it was in the subsection as enacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">91 The ordinary meaning conveyed by s 3L(1A)(a) is that if the executing officer or constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that data from a particular source accessed by operating a computer might constitute evidential material, he or she may copy the data from that source to a disk, tape or other associated device brought to the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Furthermore, a computer hard drive is a single source of data within the meaning of that paragraph (per Branson J in Kennedy v Baker at [66] and [70]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">92 When s 3L(1A) was inserted into the Crimes Act by the Cybercrime Act 2001 (Cth), s 3L(2)(c) was repealed at the same time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Section 3L(2)(c) had provided:
 
 
 '(2) If the executing officer or a constable assisting, after operating the equipment, finds that evidential material is accessible by doing so, he or she may: 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (c) if the material can be transferred to a disk, tape or other storage device that: 
 
 
 
(i) is brought to the premises; or (ii) is at the premises and the use of which for the purpose has been agreed to in writing by the occupier of the premises; 
 
 
 operate the equipment or other facilities to copy the material to the storage device and take the storage device from the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

93 It will be appreciated that s 3L(1A) does not require the relevant electronic equipment to be operated nor does it require that evidential material be found which is accessible by operating the equipment before data may be copied to a disk, tape or other associated device brought to the premises by the executing officer or constable assisting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">All that is required is that the executing officer or constable assisting 'believes' on reasonable grounds 'that any data accessed by operating the electronic equipment might constitute evidential material'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">This of course, does not preclude an executing officer or constable assisting from operating the relevant electronic equipment if he or she holds the requisite belief under s 3L(1) on reasonable grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">94 In Trimboli v Onley (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">3) (1981) 56 FLR 321 ('Trimboli'), a case under the former s 10 of the Crimes Act (see below), Holland J asked himself the rhetorical question --- at what time must the required belief be held for a seizure and subsequent detention to be lawful?</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">His Honour's response, at 335, was as follows:
 'In my opinion, the only possible answer is that the belief must exist at every point at which lawfulness is claimed under the warrant for taking and keeping another's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">...' 

 
95 Commenting on s 3L(2)(c), Hely J said in Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at [299] :
 '299 The "material" which can be transferred to a storage disk pursuant to s 3L(2)(c) is the material contained on the disk, tape or other associated device which, but for the ability to produce a duplicate disk could have been seized pursuant to the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">When the draftsman of the statute intends to refer to "evidential material" as defined, he is careful to use that term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The storage device is intended as a surrogate for the original disk, tape or other associated device, and the explanatory memorandum confirms that a duplicate disk was intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">' 

 
96 In relation to the stricter requirement for which s 3L(2)(c) provided before there could be any copying, Hely J continued at [300] by saying:
 '300 Accordingly, in my view, the production of a duplicate disk containing all of the material on the original disk, tape or other associated device was authorised by s 3L once it was ascertained that evidential material was to be found on the original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">...' 

 
97 It may be observed that Hely J took a broader view of the right to 'copy and take' than the author of the Revised Explanatory Memorandum referred to above, and, in particular, the last paragraph as quoted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Sufficiency of the description of the offences in a search warrant 
 
98 Prior to the introduction into the Act of Part IAA the relevant power to 'grant a search warrant' in respect of premises was to be found in s 10 of the Crimes Act which mirrored the provisions of s 3E(1) and (2) when taken with the definitions of 'evidential material' and 'thing relevant to an indictable offence' et cetera to which reference has been made above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In that context, a Full Court comprising Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Jackson JJ in Parker v Churchill [1986] FCA 88 ; (1986) 9 FCR 334 made declarations that certain search warrants were outside the powers conferred by s 10 of the Crimes Act insofar as they contained a paragraph (d) and so much of paragraph (b) as referred to the possible offence by Parker and Carson of falsely representing that they were registered persons for the purposes of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No 1) 1930 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The Court held that the warrants in that case were otherwise valid (see at 336 and 352).</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The offences to which the warrants related were identified in the search warrants as follows:
 '... offences against provisions of the legislation named above, being described as:--- 
 
 (a) Taxation Administration Act 1953 , sub-section 8C(d) together with sub-section 11(1) of Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">1) 1930, in that Ralph Edward Parker and Therese Isobel Carson did at various times from the twenty-sixth day of October 1984 until the present time, fail to register for sales tax purposes as manufacturers and/or wholesale merchants; 
 (b) Section 15 of Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">1) 1930, in that Ralph Edward Parker and Therese Isobel Carson did, at various times from the twenty-sixth day of October 1984 until the present time, falsely represent they are registered persons or falsely quoted a certificate; 
 (c) Section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 , in that Ralph Edward Parker and Therese Isobel Carson did, at various times from the twenty-sixth day of October 1984 until the present time, defraud the Commonwealth in relation to the purchase of raw materials free of sales tax and by failing to account for sales tax; 
 (d) Section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in that Ralph Edward Parker and Therese Isobel Carson did at various times since 30 June 1978 until the present time evade payment of income tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">' 
 


 
The leading judgment was that of Jackson J with whose judgment Bowen CJ and Lockhart J expressed their general agreement, subject to a refinement which was reflected in the declarations as made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">99 Jackson J was of the opinion that a search warrant should state the description of the offence in question with a particularity sufficient to enable the person whose premises are being searched to know the exact object of the search (see Parker v Churchill at 348; see also The Queen v Tillett; Ex parte Newton (1969) 14 FLR 101 ('Tillett') at 113; Crowley v Murphy [1981] FCA 31 ; (1981) 34 ALR 496 ('Crowley v Murphy'); Brewer v Castles [1984] FCA 47 ; (1984) 1 FCR 55 and Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Cloran (1984) 4 FCR 151 ('Cloran') at 153).</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">As Fox J said in Tillett 'the search must have a purpose and what may be searched as relevant to one purpose may, or may not, be as extensive as that which has to be searched as relevant to another purpose'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In Parker v Churchill at 349 Jackson J had described paragraph (d) as set out above as:
 '... entirely bereft of any particularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">It simply alleges in the broadest terms that "at various times" over a period of more than six years Parker and Carson had evaded payment of income tax and it is impossible in these circumstances, in my view, to regard par (d) as stating with sufficient particularity the offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">...' 

 
100 In Beneficial Finance Corporation v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [1991] FCA 92 ; (1991) 31 FCR 523 ('Beneficial Finance') Burchett J, in his leading judgment, favoured a 'broad practical approach, rather than a narrow rule requiring the identification of an 'exact object'' (see at p538 and 543).</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">At 543 his Honour continued:
 'An approach which eschews overzealous technicality, while requiring the full measure of the substance to be observed, is also consistent with the fact that the legislature has entrusted to lay justices of the peace the task of issuing search warrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">If the courts were to insist upon the invalidation of a warrant for a legally incorrect formulation of an offence, although the substance of the offence could plainly be understood, they would not be interpreting the will of the Parliament but subverting it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">For the Parliament cannot have intended lay justices to be held to such a standard, when it entrusted the task of issuing warrants to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">... ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">In my opinion, the conclusion emerges clearly that there is no justification for an "exact object" test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The matter should be viewed broadly, having regard to the terms of the warrant in the circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The question should not be answered by the bare application of a verbal formula, but in accordance with the principle that the warrant should disclose the nature of the offence so as to indicate the area of search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The precision required in a given case, in any particular respect, may vary with the nature of the offence, the other circumstances revealed, the particularity achieved in other respects, and what is disclosed by the warrant, read as a whole, and taking account of its recitals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">...' 

 
Sheppard J agreed with the reasons for judgment of Burchett J and Pincus J generally agreed with the observations of Burchett J to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">101 In Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 ('Harts') at 152 a Full Court comprising Hill, Cooper and Whitlam JJ also rejected the 'exact object of the search' test as formulated by Jackson J saying:
 '... What was required under s 10 was not the degree of particularity necessary to frame an indictment, nor was it necessary that the description of the offence be such as to permit the persons to whom the warrants were addressed to know "the exact object of the search" ... Rather, a broad approach was directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">What is significant, however, is that the warrant disclose the nature of the offence in question so as to indicate the area of search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">...' 

 
102 It is not essential to the validity of a search warrant that it contain the name of the alleged offender (per Jackson J in Parker v Churchill at 346; see also R v Tillett; ex parte Newton at 114).</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">103 There is no room for a notion that if separate offences are rolled up in a search warrant, the warrant is in some way invalidated on grounds analogous to duplicity (per Hely J in Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at [142] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">104 A reference in a search warrant to an incorrect section will not of itself invalidate a search warrant (per Jackson J in Parker v Churchill at 340).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">If a reference to an incorrect section has the result that the warrant does not specify any offence, or makes the warrant ambiguous so that it is not possible to tell what offence is referred to, it may invalidate the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">To avoid invalidity, a search warrant must disclose the nature of the offence/s sufficiently to indicate the permissible area of search in relation to which s 3E of the Crimes Act is capable of operating, in otherwise intelligible terms (see generally per Jackson J in Parker v Churchill at 340; see also Burchett J in Beneficial Finance at 543 and Harts at 152).</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">105 The administration of the criminal law requires that search warrants be issued for the purpose of obtaining evidence for legitimate use in criminal proceedings (per Lockhart J in Cloran at 154).</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">But that consideration must be weighed against the interference with privacy that is the inevitable consequence of the execution of a search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">106 It must be remembered that the entry, search and seizure authorised by the Crimes Act is not confined to the premises of a person suspected of committing a crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The owner or occupier of the premises may be quite unconnected with the commission of any crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">This illustrates the necessity for search warrants, which are intrusions into the sanctity of a person's domain and concomitantly an interference with his privacy, to define with reasonable particularity all relevant matters: the premises, the things liable to be seized and the offences which were committed or suspected to have been committed (per Lockhart J in Cloran at 154).</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">107 As crime corrupts our society and undermines the very liberties we value so highly, some judgments rightly attach great importance to the prevention, detection and punishment of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">That is a dirty, difficult, often dangerous and, more often, thankless task which we are very ready to dump upon the shoulders of our police force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">It has to be remembered that the war against crime is a war to protect and preserve our liberties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The search warrant is a valuable and frequently essential weapon in that fight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Obviously, like all weapons, it can be a danger to society if misused; but there can be no valid objection in the name of liberty to the proper use of a search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">It is said in the cases that the courts must be vigilant and have a duty to see that our liberties are not invaded by an abuse of the power to issue and execute search warrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">As it has to be recognized that the use of search warrants can serve the public good it is said that the task of the court is to find a satisfactory and workable compromise of the conflicting public interests that are involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">As cases and circumstances vary infinitely, that is easier said than done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">However, it is important in approaching problems in relation to search warrants not to overlook or underrate the value to the welfare of society of the use of the search warrant as an instrument against crime (per Holland J in Trimboli at 332-333).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">108 Although a warrant must comply strictly with the statutory conditions for its issue (see George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110-111 and State of New South Wales v Corbett [2007] HCA 32 ; (2007) 230 CLR 606 at [1] , [3], [18]-[19], [87] and [95]-[100]), it should, like other documents, be read fairly and not perversely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The language used need not be elegant (see per Burchett in Beneficial Finance at 544 and 546; see also per Hely J in Williams v Keelty at [135]-[139]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">109 In Brewer v Castles [1984] FCA 47 ; (1984) 1 FCR 55 Beaumont J gave consideration to a search warrant which, after referring to numerous classes of documents and names of individuals, firms and companies, referred to certain offences, at 56-7, in the following terms:
 'As to which there are reasonable grounds for believing that the same will afford evidence as to the commission of any offence against a law of the Commonwealth namely: 
 
 i.</sentence>

 By the aforesaid [Leonard Noel] Briot, and the aforesaid named persons in any combination and with any other person or persons unknown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">' 
110 Beaumont J refused declaratory relief sought by the applicant that the search warrant was bad for lack of specificity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">His Honour said at 62:
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">In the present case, three offences are nominated, notwithstanding that the description of the second offence is necessarily general in terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">But, in my opinion, the description of the apprehended offences in the subject warrant is sufficiently definite to indicate the nature of the documents, if any, to be seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">In my view, the proper construction of the warrant calls for a consideration of the instrument as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">... in my opinion, it is appropriate to employ language in the operative portion of the warrant which incorporates by reference material in the recitals, provided the process gives a result which is reasonably clear to the ordinary reader and is sufficiently specific in terms of identifying a particular offence...</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">In my opinion, the present warrant is reasonably clear in its operation and it does achieve the degree of specificity thus required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">...' (Emphasis added) 

 
111 The statement of an offence in a search warrant need not be made with the precision required for an indictment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">That would be impossible, and indeed to attempt it would be irrational, bearing in mind the stage of the investigation at which a search warrant may issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The purpose of the statement of the offence in a search warrant is not to define issues for trial, but to set bounds to the area of search which the execution of the warrant will involve, as part of an investigation into a suspected crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The appropriate contrast is not with the sort of error which might vitiate an indictment, but with the failure to focus the statutory suspicion and belief upon any particular crime, with the result that a condition of the issue of the warrants is not fulfilled (per Burchett J in Beneficial Finance at 533 which was cited with approval by Heerey J in Chong v Shultz [2000] FCA 582 ; (2000) 112 A Crim R 59 ('Chong v Shultz') at [7]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">112 What the rule requires is identification (and so limitation) of an area of search by reference to a suspected offence, not the formulation of a pleading before the offence is capable of prosecution (per Burchett J in Beneficial Finance at 533-534).</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">113 In Chong v Shultz the offences referred to in the search warrant were expressed as follows:
 
 
 '[i] That between 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1997, Dr Jessica Suk Yin Ho-Chong did ... avoid the payment of income tax by directing income tax [sic] derived by her into an account operated by her brother in law and other company accounts, thereby Defrauding the Commonwealth, contrary to section 29D Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 ; 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ii] That on 12 October 1992, Dr Jessica Suk Yin Ho-Chong did ... give false information to the Trustee in Bankruptcy, contrary to section 276A of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">' 
 
 
 

114 At [6] Heerey J noted the submission of senior counsel for the applicants that:
 'neither [i] nor [ii] disclose any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">As to [i], he submitted that there is no such offence as "redirecting income tax" derived by a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">As to [ii] he pointed out ... that there is no s 276A in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">' 
His Honour then added:
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">However, there is a s 267A which makes it an offence for a bankrupt to give a statement to a trustee under s 139U that is false or misleading in a material particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The penalty provided is imprisonment for 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">' 

 
115 At [9] Heerey J found that an offence had, relevantly, been stated in paragraph (i), namely the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">His Honour said:
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">I think a reasonable reading of the paragraph in question would indicate that the word "tax" where secondly appearing has been inserted in error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Such a reading is confirmed by looking, as one is entitled to do, at the context of the warrant as a whole, including the nature of the documents sought in the first condition and the persons identified in the second condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">All this suggests to the reader that the subject of the warrant is a particular kind of category of the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth, namely defrauding in relation to income tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">' 

 
116 His Honour then continued by saying at [10]:
 'The old maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet can be applied; an imperfect or inaccurate description does not detract from the true nature of the subject matter: West v Lawday [1865] EngR 318 ; (1865) 11 HLC 375 at 384 per Lord Westbury LC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">117 In respect of paragraph (ii) Heerey J followed Parker v Churchill in relation to the misdescription of the section by reference to which the offence had been identified and generally applied what Jackson J said in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">His Honour considered the observation of Jackson J at 340 to be applicable to s 3E(5)(a) as it then stood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">He said at [12]:
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">The offence of giving false information to a trustee in bankruptcy, which is undoubtedly an offence, is clearly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">' 

 
118 His Honour dismissed the application for declaratory relief to the effect that the relevant search warrants were invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The execution of search warrants generally 
 
119 What should be done when executing a search warrant will vary according to the circumstances of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">However, the power of enforcing a search warrant must, firstly, be exercised in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Secondly, it must be exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">It must not be used for some ulterior purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Thirdly, it must be exercised fairly, having regard to all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Fourthly, it must be exercised having regard to the rights of those affected by its exercise and, fifthly, the officer executing the warrant must strictly follow the directions contained in it and must not exceed the limits of the authority conferred by it (see generally per Lockhart J in Crowley v Murphy at 521).</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">120 The overriding obligation of the searcher is to do no more than is reasonably necessary to satisfy himself or herself by search that in all the circumstances of a particular case he or she has whatever documents or things are necessary to answer the terms of the search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Plainly this will vary from case to case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">What is permissible on one occasion may be impermissible on another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Much must be left to the sense of responsibility of the police officers executing the warrant and the person whose premises are to be searched (see per Lockhart J in Crowley v Murphy at 525 --- 526 (when addressing a search warrant issued under the former section 10)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">121 Speaking in the context of a seizure of documents in 2001 Hely J said in Adler v Gardiner [2002] FCA 1141 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 24 at [39] :
 '[39] The executing officer or constable assisting, has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that things seized will afford evidence as to the commission of an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The notion of reasonable grounds for a suspicion imports an objective test, but "reasonable" involves a value or normative judgment (Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125 at 167), and there may well be legitimate differences of opinion as to what falls within the term, particularly when it is used in relation to a nebulous expression such as "suspicion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">A court is not entitled to substitute its own opinion on that question for the opinion of the executing officer or constable assisting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">That does not mean that the executing officer, or constable assisting, has an unexaminable discretion; it does mean, however, that the officer's decision is only impeachable if the decision was one which the officer could not lawfully reach on the materials before him or her: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-6 ...' 

 Application of the principles to the search warrants in question 
 
122 The third condition to the search warrants in question in these proceedings purportedly identified two offences against laws of the Commonwealth said to have been committed by the second and third applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">123 In relation to the 'first offence' the putative accused were identified, the time period in which the wrongdoing was said to have occurred was clearly stated and the general nature of the offences to which the warrants related, was provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">124 This case is probably not the proper vehicle in which to address the niceties associated with the determination of the true construction of s 134.2 of the Criminal Code and its application, if any, to financial advantages that may have been derived by a shareholder or shareholders, or a director or directors of a company, from the lodgement of company income tax returns containing false claims for allowable deductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">125 The description of the 'Australian Taxation Office' as a 'Commonwealth entity' in the first offence as recorded in the Third Condition of the search warrants would appear to have been misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">126 Income tax that is due and payable:
 
(a) is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and
 
(b) is payable to the Commissioner of Taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">(See, inter alia, s 255 - 5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act'), s 166 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the 1936 Act'), s 23(2) of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 (Cth), s 250-10 of the Administration Act and the Table thereto and s 204 of the 1936 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">127 In the dictionary to the Criminal Code (see s 4), ' Commonwealth entity ' was defined to mean:
 '(a) the Commonwealth; or (b) a Commonwealth authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">' 
' Commonwealth authority ' was itself defined to mean:
 '... a body established by or under a law of the Commonwealth, but does not include: [certain bodies identified in the definition or specified in the regulations]' 

 
128 It seems to me that the 'Australian Taxation Office' as referred to in the first offence recorded in the Third Condition of the search warrants was not a 'body' so established and thus it was not a 'Commonwealth Entity'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">129 Another complication in relation to the first offence as recorded in the third condition of the search warrants is the reference to the second and third applicants obtaining a financial advantage in the form of a reduction in 'their' taxable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">130 In addition, the first offence charges that the second and third applicants, dishonestly and by deception, obtained a financial advantage in the form of a reduction of their taxable income 'by submitting false Tax Returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2006 inclusive for [ unspecified ] Australian companies and individuals by claiming false deductions for management fees and loans'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The reference to 'Australian companies and individuals' is seemingly limitless, but the words 'thereby reducing their taxable income' introduced a connection between the activities of the second and third applicants through an entity trading as Different Solutions Pty Ltd and the submission of false tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">131 Reading the warrants fairly and not perversely and putting to one side inelegant language that may have been employed, I consider that, consistent with the authorities referred to above, the search warrants sufficiently state the first offence in accordance with the requirements of s 3E(5)(a) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">132 The material recorded in the third condition in respect of the first offence is sufficient to allege that the second applicant, by a deception, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth and that the third applicant, by a deception, dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth, albeit in the somewhat curious manner described in the first offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">133 In relation to the 'second offence', the second and third applicants are clearly identified, 'with others', as alleged conspirators and the offence they allegedly conspired to commit was identified, at least by the reference to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The time period in respect of which the conspiracy was said to have been committed was also clearly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The reference to money 'worth $100,000 or more' is curious unless, perhaps, some sort of foreign currency was involved, but then, s 400.4(1)(c) requires that where there is a dealing with money falling within the subsection, and in this regard see [15]-[17] above, 'the value' of the money must be $100,000 or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">134 No mention was made of whether the conspiracy to deal with money was in relation to money believed to be the proceeds of crime on the one hand, or money intended to become an instrument of crime on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Nor was there any clear identification as to whether the 'Different Solutions' referred to was intended to identify a business carried on under that business name or the company identified as Different Solutions Pty Ltd in the statement of the first offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">135 Again, this case is probably not the proper vehicle in which to address the niceties associated with the determination of the true construction of s 400.4(1) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code , when taken with s 400.1(1) and 400.2(1), and their application, if any, to dealings with money, if any, upon which the alleged conspirators may have agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">136 However, reading the search warrants fairly and not perversely and putting to one side the inelegance of the language chosen, part of which can be attributed to the inelegance of the language in which s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code was itself expressed, I consider that the second offence referred to in the search warrants was sufficiently identified to satisfy the requirements of s 3E(5)(a) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">137 I am unable to accept the submission of the applicants that the second respondent erred by issuing search warrants that weren't sufficiently tight to comply with the requirements of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">138 Having rejected the submission of the applicants in relation to alleged deficiencies in the statement of the offences to which the search warrants related, it is now necessary to consider the execution of the warrants on 31 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Did the execution of the search warrants exceed the relevant powers?</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">
 
139 It is convenient to deal with items (a) and (b) in relation to Mosman (see [31]) and items (c), (d), (e) and (f) in relation to Pyrmont (see [52]) seriatim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">140 Before doing so I should say that if (say) a search warrant authorised the search for and seizure of cheque butts referable to cheques drawn on a particular bank account with identified serial numbers or made payable to identified payees in relation to (say) a suspected taxation fraud offence, I would consider it quite improper for the executing officer, and/or constable assisting, to dismember any book of cheque butts that may be found so as to permit seizure of a particular butt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">It would be incumbent upon the relevant officer or constable to seize the entire book even though the remaining butts may not answer the description of the search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Similarly, if (say) a search warrant authorised the search for and seizure of a manuscript ledger account referable to a particular class of income or expenditure or a subset thereof, such as 'accounts receivable from customer X', I would again consider it quite improper for the executing officer or constable assisting to dismember a bound book containing ledger accounts by tearing out or otherwise removing the relevant page or pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">It would, in my opinion, be incumbent upon the relevant officer or constable to seize the entire book, even though the remaining folios may not answer the description of the search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">141 The point that I am endeavouring to make is that if a particular item of stored information, recorded in documentary form, is itself to be found in a medium that contains other information, recorded in documentary form, then the search warrant would, in my opinion, permit seizure of the medium itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">142 Logically, one would expect that if a particular item of stored information, included in a mass or body of characters or symbols, capable of being processed into accessible form by the operation of electronic equipment, was to be found in a medium that contained other information similarly accessible, the host medium could itself be seized or copied and taken away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">143 However, the power to seize or to copy and take away can only be exercised if the relevant statutory prerequisites are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Item (a): the Seagate hard drive taken from Mosman, imaged and returned 
 
144 As previously indicated, the search warrants were not invalid because of an alleged failure on the part of the second respondent to comply with s 3E(5)(a) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">In the circumstances, it becomes necessary to consider the application of s 3L(2) and s 3F(1)(c) to the seizure of item (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">145 With a measure of frankness, for which he is renowned, senior counsel for the first respondent, without abandoning his case under s 3L(2) , acknowledged that it was 'a bit thin' and that his primary case in respect of item (a) was under s 3F(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">146 Whilst Mr Banach noticed that the Dell Mini Tower P/C was 'powered on' and clicked 'My Computer', to see if he could identify which hard disk drives were in the computer, he did not perform any key word searches to locate files or folders in the hard drives containing any of the relevant key word/s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">In the circumstances, I am unable to find that 'after operating the equipment' Mr Banach found that 'evidential material', within the meaning of the Crimes Act , was 'accessible by doing so'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Accordingly, s 3L(2) did not confer power on Mr Banach or Federal Agents Rebecca Miller or Fox to seize item (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">147 The question then becomes whether the Mosman warrant authorised seizure of item (a) as an item of evidential material specified in the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">This begs the question 'what were the kinds of evidential material (things relevant to an indictable offence or things relevant to a summary offence, including such things in electronic form) specified in the warrant?'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">148 It cannot be doubted that item (a) was a 'computer storage device' or other type of 'storage medium or storage device' within the meaning of the preamble in the first condition of the Mosman warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">However, authority for its seizure can only be found in s 3F(1)(c) of the Crimes Act if, in relation to it, all three of the conditions specified in the Mosman warrant were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">There is no evidence to establish these matters in respect of item (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">What data the item contains and what information may be accessed through such data being processed by an appropriate piece of electronic equipment is unknown, given the undertaking of the first respondent referred to at [5] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">In my opinion, s 3F(1)(c) did not authorise the seizure of item (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">149 Whether the image from the hard drive that was made at the first respondent's office in Sydney following the removal of the hard drive from the Mosman premises, should be destroyed or delivered up to the second and third applicants, if that be possible, or may be retained by the first respondent as potential evidence, illegally obtained, in relation to the offences with which the second and third applicants have now been charged, is a matter for later consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Item (b): the TALON copy of the Western Digital hard drive made at Mosman on 31 July 2007 
 
150 In my opinion s 3L(1A) provided a clear warrant for the making of the TALON 'copy' of the Western Digital hard drive at the Mosman premises on 31 July 2007 and the taking of the image so made from the Mosman premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">151 The belief of Mr Banach referred to at [44] above was, in the context of the search and his communications with Federal Agents Fox and Rebecca Miller, sufficient to constitute a belief on reasonable grounds that any data accessed by operating the Dell Mini Tower P/C might constitute evidential material within the meaning of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Furthermore, the belief of Federal Agent Fox referred to at [46] above was, in the context of the search and his communications with Federal Agents Rebecca Miller and Phun, the Standard Technical Plan for Operation Starlifter and his prior involvement in the execution of Operation Starlifter search warrants, sufficient to constitute a belief on reasonable grounds that any data accessed by operating the Dell Mini Tower PC might constitute evidential material within the meaning of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">That belief, coupled with Federal Agent Fox's instruction to Mr Banach to image the Dell Mini Tower P/C (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">relevantly items (a) and (b)) brought the making and taking of the TALON copy of the Western digital hard drive within the power conferred by s 3L(1A) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Items (c) and (d): the Dell Power Edge Server known as 'REX' and the 500GB Lacie external hard drive removed from Pyrmont, imaged and then returned 
 
152 The situation in relation to items (c) and (d) under s 3L(2) of the Crimes Act is not the same as it was for item (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">153 Unlike Mr Banach at Mosman, Mr Bruce at Pyrmont conducted a key word search of the computer disk volume labelled as 'Archive' connected to the server named 'Rex'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">He electronically located files for the search term 'Owen T Daniel' on an external drive but was unable to identify which of the external drives was the one which was identified as 'Archive' electronically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">154 The authority conferred by s 3L(2) of the Crimes Act to seize the equipment did not require Mr Bruce to find that 'evidential material specified in the warrant ' was accessible by operating the equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">All that was necessary was that he find, after operating the equipment, that 'evidential material is accessible by doing so'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Relevantly that required him to find something as to which there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that it would afford evidence as to the commission of an indictable offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">155 Given the matters referred to at [56], [57], [59], [60] and [63] above there were reasonable grounds for Mr Bruce suspecting, as I find that he did, that there were things on the hard drives which would afford evidence as to the commission of an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">156 I am satisfied that it was not practicable to copy the data within items (c) and (d) at the Pyrmont premises and infer that it was not practicable to put the evidential material in documentary form by using facilities at the Pyrmont premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Accordingly items (c) and (d) were lawfully seized within the power conferred by s 3L(2) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">157 If I were in error in reaching the conclusions which I have in relation to the application of s 3L(2) to items (c) and (d), I would conclude that seizure of the two items was within the power conferred by s 3F(1)(c) or (d), in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">158 Items (c) and (d) were undoubtedly computer storage devices or other types of storage media or storage devices within the meaning of the preamble in the first condition of the Pyrmont warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The authority for their seizure under s 3F(1)(c) of the Crimes Act required that in relation to each of the items all three of the conditions specified in the Pyrmont warrant were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">In my opinion, the evidence of Mr Bruce (and in this regard see, inter alia [56], [59], [60] and [63] above) provided sufficient justification for the seizure of items (c) and (d) under s 3F(1)(c) of the Crimes Act on the basis that the three conditions had been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">159 Alternatively, if the three conditions were not satisfied, the matters referred to at [65]-[66] above provided a proper basis for the seizure of items of (c) and (d) at Pyrmont in accordance with s 3F(1)(d) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In this context, Federal Agent Serrano's belief that the Dell Power Edge Server known as 'Rex' may have been tampered with by somebody externally earlier in the day on 31 July 2007 with the intention of trying to destroy evidence, is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Federal Agent Serrano undoubtedly believed, on what I consider to have been reasonable grounds, that evidential material in relation to one or other or both of the offences to which the Pyrmont warrant related was to be found stored in the items (c) and (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">Item (e): the two Hewlett Packard E-Vectras 
 
160 The case for seizure of the two hard drives (item (e)) under s 3L(2) is put on the basis that items (c) and (d) were lawfully seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">It is said that the two hard drives, together item (e), which were discovered in a box behind the staircase at Pyrmont on 31 July 2007, were covered by the words 'and any disk, tape or other associated device' in s 3L(2)(a) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">161 The phrase in question clearly provides authority for detached items customarily used in or in relation to computers to be exposed to seizure in the same way as the computers themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">162 Given the evidence summarised at [61]-[62] I am of the opinion that the two hard drives covered by item (e) were covered by the expression 'and any disk, tape or other associated device' and, as such, properly seized along with items (c) and (d) under s 3L(2) of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">163 Were I in error in concluding that item (e) was properly seized under s 3L(2) of the Crimes Act , I would conclude that the power contained in s 3F(1)(c) did not authorise seizure of the two hard drives for reasons akin to those recorded in relation to item (a) and the application of s 3F(1)(c) thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">What data the two hard drives comprising item (e) contain and what information may be accessed through such data being processed by an appropriate piece of electronic equipment is unknown, given the undertaking of the first respondent referred to at (5) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Item (f): the CD 
 
164 In my opinion, seizure of the CD (item (f)) cannot be justified under s 3F(1)(c) for the reason that authority for its seizure under that provision could only be found if, in relation to the CD, all three of the conditions specified in the Pyrmont warrant were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">165 It may be inferred from the label 'Payment Summary Report 1/7/04-30/6/05' and the location of the CD in a drawer at the premises of the first applicant at Pyrmont, that the CD includes 'Accounting documents and working papers' referable to the first applicant, sufficient to satisfy the first condition and the second condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">However, there is no evidence to establish that the CD satisfies the third condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">There was no evidence to establish reasonable grounds for suspecting that information accessible via the CD would afford evidence as to the commission of one or other or both of the offences mentioned in the third condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">166 In my opinion, s 3F(1)(c) did not authorise the seizure of item (f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Resolution of the issues arising under the Further Amended Application 
 
167 In the light of the findings made above, I would conclude that the applicants are not entitled to declaratory relief as sought in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Further Amended Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">168 Insofar as prayer for relief 2(a) is concerned, there can be no basis for the grant of declaratory relief in circumstances where the issues relating to legal professional privilege were resolved between the parties on terms which were never disclosed to the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">169 Under prayer for relief 2(b), no issues arose in respect of 'documents' that were seized on 31 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">As to 'other material', my findings in relation to the seizure or copying and taking of such material do not warrant the making of any declarations, except perhaps in respect of items (a) and (f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">In relation to those items, there remains the question as to whether the first respondent may use the image of the hard drive (item (a)) and/or the CD (item (f)) which were illegally obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">170 Section 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) confers a discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">However, it contemplates that evidence that may be contained in the image of the hard drive (item (a)) or the CD (item (f)) could become evidence in, relevantly, the proceedings instituted against the second and third applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">171 In Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission (2008) 249 ALR 371 the High Court addressed what it referred to as 'fragmentation of the criminal process'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">At [23] a Full Bench of the High Court comprising Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said:
 '23 With respect to the exercise of the power to make the declaratory orders now sought by the applicants, authority in this Court affirms an important general principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">This is that power to make declaratory orders should be exercised sparingly where the declaration would touch the conduct of criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">The fragmentation of the criminal process is to be actively discouraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">...' (Footnote omitted) 
172 Counsel for the applicants submitted that the cases to which the High Court referred were cases where prosecutions were interrupted not cases instituted at the evidence gathering stage rather than the prosecution stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">True that may be, but, in the present case the quite significant amendments to the Application were not made until after the relevant Court Attendance Notices had been served whereby the prosecutions of the second and third applicants were commenced and more importantly the applicants did not adduce any evidence to establish that neither the image of the hard drive (item (a)) nor the CD (item (f)) contained any evidence that could be admissible on the prosecution of the charges laid against the second and third applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">173 In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] QSC 46 Holmes J said at [57] in proceedings in the Queensland Supreme Court:
 '57 The overwhelming weight of persuasive authority ... supports the existence of a discretion to be exercised in considering an application for the return of illegally seized items; and moreover points to a refusal to exercise that discretion where criminal proceedings are on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">On balance in this case, the greater interest lies in preserving the evidence; the question of admissibility may properly be left to the trial judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Accordingly, I would not be prepared to make any order for the return of items seized pursuant to the invalid warrant if they are required for the prosecution of the first applicant ....</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">There is however, no material presently before me as to the evidentiary value of the seized items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">I would be prepared to receive further material and hear argument, should the parties so wish, as to whether any or all of the material seized does in fact afford evidence of an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">...' 
174 Holmes J proceeded to dismiss the application insofar as it sought the grant of an injunction requiring the delivery up of documents that had been seized and copies thereof but he was prepared to adjourn for further consideration the question as to whether an order should be made for the return of the illegally seized items in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">175 In Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 Hill J addressed the question of whether items seized pursuant to an invalid warrant should be returned to the parties from whom they were seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">At 403 his Honour expressed the opinion that prima facie the applicants in that case were entitled to an order against the Commissioner of Police directing that the goods seized under the invalid warrant be returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">His Honour then went on to consider whether or not he should refuse to grant the relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">At 405 his Honour said:
 '... it must be said that the preponderance of view is in favour of refusing to order the return of items, even where those items have been illegally seized, if there are criminal proceedings pending in which the items may be used as evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">While the court would not wish to be seen to be rewarding members of the police who obtain possession of material without lawful authority, there is to be weighed against that a public interest in the administration of and non-interference with justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Should the court order that material, albeit invalidly obtained, to be used in evidence in a pending prosecution be delivered up to those from whom it was taken the prosecution, which might otherwise succeed, could be frustrated .</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">'
