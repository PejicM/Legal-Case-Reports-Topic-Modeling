<sentence id="s0">
 
 On 28 July 2006 I made orders with respect to the respondents' motion, notice of which was filed on 26 May 2006, as well as with respect to the applicant's substantive application, or at least what remained of it, the net effect of which was to set down for hearing on Wednesday, 30 August 2006 both the respondents' motion and the applicant's substantive application, on a final basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">At the same time I made orders for the filing and serving of further evidence upon which the applicant proposed to rely and for the filing and serving of further evidence by the respondents in reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In the events that happened, the applicant put on no further evidence and, in consequence, nor did the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">When the matter came on for hearing, there was no appearance by or on behalf of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">No prior communication was received by the Court explaining the applicant's failure to appear and no apology or explanation was subsequently tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The respondents were represented by Ms Eastman of counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The respondents relied on two affidavits sworn by Ms Janine Lynette Smith on 26 May 2006 (filed 29 May 2006) and on 26 July 2006 (filed 27 July 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The respondents also relied on three paragraphs ([34] --- [36]) of an affidavit of the applicant sworn 24 May 2005 and to the documents, or some of them, comprising Annexure 'Z' thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In the face of the orders I made on 28 July 2006, in particular, the order dismissing the applicant's motion, notice of which was filed on 13 December 2005, only the orders sought in [1] and [4] of the respondents' notice of motion, namely, that the remaining parts of the applicant's substantive application ([A4] and [A6]) be dismissed or permanently stayed and that the respondents be released from the undertakings made to the Court on 8 June 2005, were pressed on the hearing; the orders sought in [2] and [3] of the respondents' notice of motion were not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A history of this matter is summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions, which I gratefully adopt: 
 
 (i) On 30 May 2005 the applicant filed an application seeking judicial review of a range of alleged decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">(ii) On 5 July 2005 the applicant provided the respondents with a proposed amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">(iii) On 24 August 2005 I heard the applicant's motion seeking leave to amend the application and the respondents' motion seeking to strike out part of the application and opposing leave to amend the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">(iv) I determined the motions by reference to the proposed amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On 22 September 2005 I determined that all of the applicant's application be struck out, other than that contained in [A4] and [A6] in the proposed amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Those paragraphs provided:

<sentence id="s27">These were the claims that had been previously in [B1] of proposed amended application.</sentence>

<sentence id="s30">' 
 
 
 
 (ix) On 3 November 2005 the applicant provided a proposed further amended application to the respondents dated 1 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">(x) On 11 November 2005 the respondents wrote to the applicant observing that, in their opinion, the proposed amended application was not consistent with the leave granted by Branson J, did not comply with the Federal Court Rules , included claims that were struck out by myself and raised fresh matters which are not included in the application considered by me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The applicant was invited to provide a re-pleaded application by 14 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">(xi) On 5 December 2005 the applicant emailed a proposed notice of motion to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">(xii) On 6 December 2005 the matter came before me when I made the following orders:

 (xiii) On 13 December 2005 the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking various orders including leave to re-plead and amend his amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He also sought to join Comcare as a third respondent to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">This motion was in the same terms as the motion emailed on 5 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">(xiv) On 14 December 2005 the respondents notified the applicant of their objections to the form of the application proposed by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The respondents' letter set out the reasons why they opposed leave being granted to amend the application in the form proposed in the document provided on 3 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(xv) On 15 December 2005 the applicant's notice of motion was dealt with in part, but the question of leave to re-plead was adjourned to a date to be fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">(xvi) The applicant did not file and serve any amended application within a further 14 days, i.e., by 28 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">(xvii) When the matter came before me on 7 February 2006, I directed the applicant to file and serve any amended application upon which he relies as a consequence of my orders of 15 December 2005 by 7 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">(xviii) The applicant did not then file or serve any amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">(xix) When the matter came before me on 14 March 2006 I directed the applicant to file and serve any amended application upon which he relies by 4 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(xx) The applicant then did not file or serve any amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">(xxi) When the matter came before me on 18 April 2006, the matter was stood over to 9 May 2006 by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">By this time the applicant had attended Dr Smith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Dr Smith had provided a copy of his report in relation to the applicant's fitness to return to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The applicant wanted to have the opportunity to consider the report and then indicate what he would seek to do in relation to his proposed amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">(xxii) When the matter came before me on 9 May 2006, I directed the respondents to file and serve any motion in relation to striking out the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">(xxiii) On 7 June 2006 the motion was listed for hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I ordered that the motion be adjourned to 22 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I ordered the applicant file and serve any evidence in reply by 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The applicant has failed to comply with these orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(xxiv) On 28 July 2006 I dismissed the applicant's motion, notice of which was filed on 13 December 2005 leaving the outstanding paragraphs, [A4] and [A6], in the proposed amended application to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 As indicated in [1] above, the net effect of the orders I made on 28 July 2006 was to set down for hearing both the respondents' motion and the applicant's substantive application, on a final basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">So far as the order sought in [4] of the respondents' notice of motion is concerned, I indicated during the course of the hearing that I could see no reason why the respondents should not be released from the undertakings they gave the Court on 8 July 2005 and accordingly that I would make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">While argument on the order sought in [1] of the respondents' notice of motion, at least in relation to the decision/conduct sought to be reviewed under [A4], was largely confined to matters going to the discretion the Court has under para 10(2)(b) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the AD(JR) Act') to refuse to grant an application, it was conceded by counsel for the respondents that the decision/conduct sought to be reviewed under [A6], at least standing alone, could not be dealt with on the same basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">To dispose of it on a final basis it would be necessary to review the decision/conduct in terms of the grounds relied on in the application and the particulars provided in support of those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">This leads to the problem outlined below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">One of the difficulties with the applicant's case has always been the architecture of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The grounds upon which the applicant seeks review of decisions made or conduct engaged in and particulars of those grounds has always been articulated on a holistic basis, that is, by reference to the decisions made or conduct engaged in as set out in [A1] to [A6] of his application, rather than by reference to specific grounds in respect of each decision made, or conduct engaged in, which is sought to be reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In consequence of the orders I made on 24 August 2005, [A1], [A2], [A3] and [A5] no longer exist and it is not possible to discern whether the applicant seeks review of the remaining decisions/conduct --- those in [A4] and [A6] --- in reliance on all or only some of the grounds stated; moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to discern whether all or only some, if any at all, of the particulars given relate to the grounds now sought to be relied on in the review of the decisions/conduct in [A4] and [A6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I therefore propose to assume that the remaining decisions/conduct in [A4] and [A6] sought to be reviewed, are sought to be reviewed on all grounds, namely --- 
 
 (1) That the decisions or proposed decisions were not authorised by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made (paras 5(1)(d) and 6(1)(d) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (2) that the person who purported to make the decisions did not have jurisdiction to make the decisions/that the person who has engaged, is engaging, or proposes to engage, in the conduct does not have jurisdiction to make the proposed decisions (paras 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(c) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (3) that the decisions involved errors or law, whether or not the errors appear on the record of the decisions/that errors of law have been, are being, or are likely to be committed in the course of the conduct or are likely to be committed in the making of the proposed decisions (paras 5(1)(f) and 6(1)(f) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (4) that the decisions were otherwise contrary to law/that the making of the proposed decisions would be otherwise contrary to law (paras 5(1)(j) and 6(1)(j) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (5) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made (paras 5(1)(e) and 6(1)(e) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (6) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they were or would be an exercise of a discretionary power in bad faith (paras 5(2)(d) and 6(2)(d) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (7) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they involved or would involve an exercise of a power that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power (paras 5(2)(g) and 6(2)(g) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (8) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they constitute or would constitute an abuse of the power (paras 5(2)(j) and 6(2)(j) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (9) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that irrelevant considerations were or would be taken into account in the exercise of the power (paras 5(2)(a) and 6(2)(a) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (10) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that there was or would be a failure to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power (paras 5(2)(b) and 6(2)(b) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (11) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they involved or would involve an exercise of a personal discretionary power at the direction or behest of another person (paras 5(2)(e) and 6(2)(e) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (12) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they involved or would involve an exercise of a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case (paras 5(2)(f) and 6(2)(f) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (13) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur in connection with the making of the decisions or the conduct (paras 5(1)(a) and 6(1)(a) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (14) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decisions or in respect of the conduct were not, are not being, or are likely not to be observed (paras 5(1)(b) and 6(1)(b) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (15) that there is no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decisions or proposed decisions (paras 5(1)(h), 5(3)(b), 6(1)(h) and 6(3)(b) of the AD(JR) Act);
 (16) that the making of the decisions or proposed decisions was or would be an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which they were purported to have been or proposed to be made in that they involved or would involve an exercise of a power in such a way that the results of the exercise of the power are uncertain (paras 5(2)(h) and 6(2)(h) of the AD(JR) Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 The applicant provided the following particulars in respect of grounds (1) to (4): 
 
 
 '(i) ... 
 
 (ii) At all material times, and in accordance with subsection 55ZB(2) of the Judiciary Act , the applicant's terms and conditions of employment were recorded in writing, through various documents, including the AGS Certified Agreements 1999-2002, the AGS Employment Handbook, incorporating various legislation, including the Judiciary Act , Judiciary Amendment Act 1999 , SRC Act and OHS Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 (iii) The applicant's terms and conditions of employment do not empower the respondents to require him to undergo a medical assessment in respect of a compensable injury under the SRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Only Comcare has such a power pursuant to section 57 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 (iv) There are no "common law" or other powers available to the respondents pursuant to section 16 of the OHS Act, to make the decision set out paragraphs A1-A3 above, or to make the applicant's return to work conditional on their satisfaction concerning his fitness for work or other conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 
 (v) So far as the respondents purport to rely on the obiter dicta of Madgwick J in Blackadder , the court would not apply his Honour's comments in the circumstances of this case, particularly having regard to the judgment of the High Court of Australia on 27 April 2005 ([2005] HCA 22).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 Or in the alternative: 
 
 (vi) So far as such "common law" powers may be available to the respondents, they arise pursuant to the OHS Act and are not common law powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">So far as any such "common law" powers are available to the respondents pursuant to section 16 the OHS Act, there is no reasonable basis for their exercise in the circumstances of the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The respondent's have not established that its actions are necessary or that the terms of its briefing are reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 
 (vii) It was reasonable for the applicant to refuse to attend the medical appointment arranged on 31 May 2005 because: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) it was a requirement imposed on him outside the terms and conditions of his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 (b) there is no operative power requiring him to submit to such an examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 (c) no adequate reasons had been provided as to the basis of the requirement, including disclosing that the respondents were basing their approach on the first instance judgment in Blackadder v Ramsey .</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 (d) the terms of briefing to the doctor are incorrect and prejudicial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 (e) the respondents undertook to brief the applicant's treating specialist with all of their concerns about his medical certificate of 4 January 2005, but has briefed its doctor with a much greater range of material, on a broader range of issues briefed to the applicant's doctor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 (f) the scope of material to be referred to the doctor is irrelevant and too voluminous to ensure his report would be prepared within a reasonable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This material was prepared prior to any consideration of applying subsection 36(3) and has not been updated to address this at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The respondents' draft letter to the doctor of 17 March 2005 was changed without further reference to the applicant, and sent to the doctor, along with the material objected to by the applicant, on 16 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 (g) the respondents were exercising the powers unlawfully and in bad faith, or if not, it was reasonable for the applicant to form the subjective view that the respondents' conduct towards him since 11 October 2004, and that its directions and requirements of 5 May 2005, were not bona fides .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 
 
 
 
 (viii) The second respondent was not, at any material time, lawfully delegated by the first respondent to exercise any such powers under the OHS Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ix) So far as the respondents seek to rely, from 5 May 2005, on their powers as a "rehabilitation authority" under Part III of the SRC Act, they are functus officio , having failed to take any steps to implement another rehabilitation program, than the private program the applicant commenced on 20 October 2004, during the currency of the applicant's unfitness for duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The respondents' first attempt to exercise this power to require the applicant to attend a medical assessment was on 5 May 2005, when the applicant had been certified fit to return to work on and from 17 January 2005.</sentence>

 The respondents are not entitled to rely on their own defaults and delays.</sentence>

<sentence id="s92">[formerly para A1 (vii)]' 
 
 
 
 The applicant provided the following particulars in respect of ground (5): 
 
 
 '(a) The evidence establishes that the true purposes of the decisions/conduct, contrary to those stated by the respondents, were: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) A "fishing expedition"; requiring the applicant to undergo a medical examination to retrospectively procure medical evidence to support the respondents' decisions and conduct in relation to the applicant's employment since 17 January 2005, and to hide their own prior and ongoing default in their statutory duties to the applicant (as listed in paragraph A7 above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">
 (ii) To procure the applicant's absence from the workplace from 17 January 2005, direct the applicant to absent himself from duties from 5 May 2005, and to suspend his pay from 16 May 2005 for the purpose of procuring applicant's compliance with their prior and ongoing unlawful actions and prevent him from taking steps to pursue or corroborate his complaints about AGS management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 (iii) To procure powers over the applicant's employment (for the purposes listed above), which are not conferred by legislation or the applicant's terms and conditions of employment, in breach of clause 4 of Schedule 2 to the Judiciary Amendment Act 1999 .</sentence>

 (iv) To delay applicant's return to workplace from 17 January 2005 due to personal and political concerns on the part of the respondents (as set out in the particulars in relation to ground 3 below), and until they could retrospectively attempt to achieve compliance with their statutory duties towards the applicant.</sentence>

 The applicant provided the following particulars in respect of grounds (6) to (8) inclusive: 
 
 'The following cumulatively ... support the inferences necessary to meet the strict onus of establishing these grounds:

<sentence id="s97">
 
 (ii) The approach taken by the second respondent in respect of the applicant's request for leave relief to undertake counselling in September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 
 (iii) The approach to the applicant's Comcare claim engaged in by the second respondent and Peter Stein, the second respondent's former HR Manager, (in collusion with Dale Watson and/or others), in procuring statements in opposition to the applicant's claim to Comcare, delaying transmission of the claim, and submitting this material to Comcare, without including an incident report of 11 October 2004 made by the applicant in relation to Mr Stein's conduct towards him on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
 
 (iv) The lies and misleading information provided to the applicant by the second respondent in relation to his employment and leave status between October and December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 
 (v) The second respondent's attempt, on being provided with a medical certificate certifying the applicant fit to return to duties on 10 January 2005, to require him to attend a medical assessment with a general practitioner from HSA in accordance with AGS procedures for "medical retirement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This occurred prior to the determination of the applicant's claim to Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">She attempted to procure the applicant's consent to undergo such an examination by hiding the illegality and inappropriateness of this from him.</sentence>

 (vi) Failure to take any steps as rehabilitation provider, including in accordance with its published procedures, during the period for which the applicant was certified unfit for duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 (vii) The interpretation adopted by the respondents to the stipulation made in the applicant's medical certificate of 5 January 2005, that they were unable to understand or implement it, when in fact they were denying its contents on a factual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 
 
 In relation the second respondent's conduct of the meeting with the applicant on 17 January 2005: 
 
 
 
 (viii) She misled the applicant into believing he would be restored to pay and on duty, but had already decided, on the basis of directions "from Canberra", to deny the applicant permission to return to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
 
 (ix) Her knowing or reckless misrepresentation to the applicant of her status as decision-maker and her delegation from the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">

<sentence id="s108">
 
 (xi) Her agreement to have regard to further information from the applicant's treating doctor, when she had no intention of having regard to this material or permitting the applicant to return to work without an "independent medical assessment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 
 (xii) The second respondent's actions delayed the applicant's return to the workplace in order ensure he was absent from the workplace while she unilaterally compiled evidence against the credibility of the claims made in the applicant's statement of 9 December 2004, to inhibit the applicant taking steps to pursue his claims against AGS management absent and to obtain corroborating evidence of these from the AGS employees nominated by the applicant, which the second respondent chose not to consult.</sentence>

 PARAGRAPH A4 
 
 The decision sought to be reviewed under this head is the decision made by the second respondent on 5 May 2005 pursuant to subs 36(3) of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the SRC Act') requiring the applicant to attend a psychiatric assessment 'for the additional purpose of assessing the applicant's capability to undertake a rehabilitation programme within the meaning of the SRC Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The 'conduct engaged in' sought to be reviewed is not specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The applicant's original application indicates that at the time of its filing on 30 May 2005 this decision was the subject of an application for review by the applicant to Comcare pursuant to subs 38(2) of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">On 21 September 2005 Comcare made a decision under subs 38(4) of the SRC Act affirming the second respondent's decision and on 25 November 2005 the applicant filed an Application for Review of Decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the AAT') being file number N2005/1558, pursuant to subs 64(1) of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The application seeks the review of decisions by Comcare and the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">On 23 December 2005 the applicant agreed to discontinue the AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The applicant did not discontinue the AAT proceedings and on 4 May 2006 advised the AAT that he wished to proceed with the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The respondents submit that with respect to an application before this Court to review the second respondent's decision of 5 May 2005 to direct the applicant to attend a psychiatric assessment under subs 36(3) of the SRC Act, the proceedings in the AAT make adequate provision for this decision to be reviewed on its merits: see Comcare v Sassella [2001] FCA 1514 ; (2001) 34 AAR 142.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In the circumstances, the respondents submit that it would be appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion under subs 10(2)(b) of the AD(JR) Act and refuse to grant this part of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Section 10 of the AD(JR) Act, so far as is relevant, provides: 
 
 
 '10(1) The rights conferred by sections 5, 6 and 7 on a person to make an application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision or in respect of a failure to make a decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other rights that the person has to seek a review, whether by the court, by another court, or by another tribunal, authority or person, of that decision, conduct or failure; and 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1): 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may, in its discretion, refuse to grant an application under section 5, 6 or 7 that was made to the court in respect of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision, or in respect of a failure to make a decision, for the reason: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) that the applicant has sought a review by the court, or by another court, of that decision, conduct or failure otherwise than under this Act; or 
 (ii) that adequate provision is made by any law other than this Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review by the court, by another court, or by another tribunal, authority or person, of that decision, conduct or failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">
 
 
 
 
 (3) In this section, review includes a review by way of reconsideration, re-hearing, appeal, the grant of an injunction or of a prerogative or statutory writ or the making of a declaratory or other order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">' 
 
 
 
 
 Subsection 10(2) should also be read with s 16 of the AD(JR) Act which makes it clear that the grant of relief pursuant to the AD(JR) Act is discretionary: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 per Mason CJ at 338; and Wyeth Australia Pty Ltd v Minister for Health &amp; Aged Care (2000) 61 ALD 372; [2000] FCA 330.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">I am of the view that the applicant's application to review the decision made and/or conduct engaged in by the second respondent as detailed in [A4] of the proposed amended application should be refused on discretionary grounds namely, that adequate provision is made by a law other than the AD(JR) Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek review by the AAT of that decision made and/or conduct engaged in and the applicant has, indeed, sought that alternative review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">
 PARAGRAPH A6 OF THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION 
 
 In the original application filed on 30 May 2005 the applicant sought review of the decision of the first respondent to delegate her powers pursuant to, inter alia , s 55ZA of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) under the AD(JR) Act: see [6](v) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Section 55ZA is found in Part VIIIB of the Judiciary Act and is concerned with the establishment and the functions of the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor ('the AGS').</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Schedule 1, cl (za) of the AD(JR) Act excludes decisions under Part VIIIB of the Judiciary Act from review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">I agreed with the respondents' submissions that these decisions were excluded from AD(JR) Act review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In the amended application the applicant deleted his application for review of the s 55ZA decisions with respect to the AD(JR) Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">He sought to have the decision reviewed under Part B of the proposed amended application with respect to review under s 39B of the Judiciary Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">However, these parts of the proposed amended application were also struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 PARAGRAPH A6 
 
 Accordingly, there are no outstanding claims for review of decisions made and/or conduct engaged in under [A6] of the application save for those in relation to the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Review is now sought of the decision of the first respondent made on 5 May 2005, pursuant to s 41A of the SRC Act, to delegate to the second respondent, who is an employee of the AGS, all of her powers as a rehabilitation authority under Part III of the SRC Act, in relation to the applicant, who is also an employee of the AGS; a review is also sought of the conduct of the second respondent, or such other persons involved, in procuring this obligation from the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The decision made and/or conduct engaged in sought to be reviewed in [A6] is anterior to the decision made and/or conduct engaged in sought to be reviewed in [A4]; indeed, the decision made and/or conduct engaged in sought to be reviewed under [A4] is predicated upon a decision (presumably a lawful one) made of the type sought to be reviewed under [A6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">However, for the reasons given in [19] --- [25] above, I have indicated that I would refuse the application in so far as it seeks review of a decision made and/or conduct engaged in under [A4].</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In the circumstances, the utility of undertaking a review of the decision made and/or conduct engaged in under [A6] is called into question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The particulars provided in support of grounds (1) --- (4) inclusive make no reference to the decision and/or conduct sought to be reviewed under [A6]; accordingly, and contrary to the initial assumption in [10] above, I have taken the view that grounds (1) --- (4) inclusive are not relied on in relation to the applicant's application to review the decision/conduct in [A6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The same observation is applicable to the particulars provided in support of grounds (5), (9) and (10)], (11) and (12), (13) and (14), (15) and (16).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Presumably these grounds are not relied on in relation to review of the decision/conduct sought to be reviewed under [A6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Particular (xxv) in support of grounds (6) --- exercise of discretionary power in bad faith; (7) --- Wednesbury unreasonableness; and (8) --- abuse of power, refers to the delegation decision in [A6] in the following way: 
 
 'The specific delegations made by the first respondent on 5 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The first respondent, actually or constructively had knowledge that they would be used for improper purposes by the second respondent and to delay the applicant's return to active duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">' 
 
 
 There is no evidence that the decision of the first respondent, made on 5 May 2005, pursuant to s 41A of the SRC Act, to delegate to the second respondent, who is an employee of the AGS, all of her powers as a rehabilitation authority under Part III of the SRC Act, in relation to the applicant, who is also an employee of the AGS, was infected by the second respondent's use of the delegation for improper purposes, and even if there were, there is no evidence that the first respondent actually or constructively had knowledge that the delegation would be so used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Nor is there any evidence that the decision is infected by the second respondent's use of the delegation to delay the applicant's return to active duties and, even if there were, there is no evidence that the first respondent actually or constructively had knowledge that the delegation would be so used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Moreover, there is no evidence that the conduct of the second respondent, or some other unidentified persons, 'procured' this delegation from the first respondent and even if there were, the conduct sought to be reviewed is not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">In the absence of such identification, it is impossible to come to any view as to whether, in relation to such unidentified conduct, the grounds of review in (6) --- (8) inclusive are made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 CONCLUSION 
 
 The applicant's application must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The applicant must pay the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to make any order of the kind sought in (1) of the respondents' notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">However, as already indicated, I will make an order of the kind sought in (4) of the respondents' notice of motion.</sentence>
