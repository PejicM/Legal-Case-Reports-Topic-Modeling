 1 By application and statement of claim, each filed on 20 October 2005, the applicant Les Tissus Marey S A, a company incorporated pursuant to the law of France, seeks relief for breach of copyright against various respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">These include Lisa Ho Retail Pty Ltd and Lisa Ho Designs Pty Ltd, the second and third respondents ("the Lisa Ho respondents"), and Smouha Fabrics Pty Ltd, the fifth respondent ("Smouha").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The applicant is a designer, wholesaler and manufacturer of fabric.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It creates original fabric designs which are then sold through its agents to clothing manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers around the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Each fabric print designed by the applicant is sold to only one clothing designer or manufacturer in any given country in order to maintain the exclusivity of the applicant's fabrics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The applicant claims that in 2004, through its exclusive distributor in Australia, it sold a particular print to Sportsgirl which used that print to manufacture garments which were sold at Sportsgirl's retail outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It alleges that the print in question is an original artistic work in which copyright subsists by virtue of Pt III of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), such copyright being owned by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It contends that the Lisa Ho respondents have, without the licence of the applicant, manufactured, distributed and sold garments which reproduce the copyright in the print, or authorised the carrying out of such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and foreshadows as well a claim in damages or, alternatively, at the election of the applicant, an account of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The matter presently before the Court involves two motions on notice, one by the Lisa Ho respondents, and one by Smouha, seeking security for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant accepts that it must provide security for costs, but challenges the amount claimed in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 On behalf of the Lisa Ho respondents, the amount claimed is $110,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Smouha's claim is for $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Both claims are supported by affidavits sworn by solicitors for the respective parties and, in the case of Smouha, by an affidavit of a legal costs consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 On behalf of the applicant, it is contended that a much lower figure would be warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Its solicitor has estimated that the total for taxable costs incurred to date and future costs would be approximately $45,000 for the Lisa Ho respondents and also for Smouha.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 The discrepancy can be partly explained by the differing assumptions made by the respective parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant's solicitor stated that, in his view, it would be appropriate to split the determination of quantum from any issue of liability which would substantially reduce the ambit of discovery, and shorten the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This would avoid potentially wasted costs should the applicant fail to establish liability on its claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Although he did not file a notice of motion in support of an order separating quantum and liability, he foreshadowed that such an application would be made at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 Because the respondents were not given adequate notice of the proposed application to separate quantum from liability, and because it seemed to me that the resolution of that issue might be relevant to the sum or sums ordered by way of security for costs, I directed that the parties file written submissions regarding that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 By letters dated 11 August 2006, both the Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha agreed with the applicant that issues of liability and quantum should be dealt with separately in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That makes my task somewhat easier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The assumption upon which those respondents based their applications for security for costs was that there would be a single trial, encompassing both liability and quantum, and that it would run for something in the order of five days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is common ground between the parties that a case confined to liability would be considerably shorter and more straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant estimates two days, while the Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha seem to suggest three days, or perhaps a little more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 Having regard to the evidence before me, and the views of the respective solicitors who have sworn affidavits, I am inclined to the view that the Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha's calculations are more likely to be accurate than those of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Nonetheless, by reason of the separation of liability and quantum, there will be a considerable saving in the scope of discovery, as well as the duration of the trial and this should be reflected in the amount ordered as security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 In my view, it would be appropriate to order security in the sum of $70,000 in favour of the Lisa Ho respondents and $100,000 in favour of Smouha.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">These amounts are to cover the costs of the proceeding through to the end of the trial on liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The figures proffered by the applicant of $45,000 for the Lisa Ho respondents and $45,000 for Smouha, are so low as to be quite unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">They do not take account of the complexity of the issues raised, and they fail adequately to allow for Smouha's retention of senior counsel in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">12 Equally however, there may be some overestimate in the figure put forward by Smouha.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The sum of $150,000 anticipates having two solicitors in Court throughout the trial, which I regard as unnecessary, and a great deal of photocopying which probably does not need to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It also includes what might be thought to be a somewhat leisurely approach to preparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">13 The parties were also asked to give consideration to an early mediation in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha take the view that a mediation as to liability ought to occur subject to the applicant confirming that a representative of the applicant with authority to settle the matter attend the mediation, and that it take place in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They believe that the case has better prospects of settling if the mediation is conducted by an external mediator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">14 The applicant's position is that there should be a mediation, but that it should be conducted by a Registrar of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The applicant contends that the mediation should take place in Melbourne, and does not wish to bind itself to the attendance of a representative from France.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">15 In my view, the applicant's contention should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The mediation should be conducted by a Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The process is far cheaper, and as likely to be effective as the use of an external mediator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In addition, it should be conducted in Melbourne, which is where the trial is to take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">16 The question whether a representative of the applicant, brought out from France, should be present, with authority to settle the matter is perhaps more difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I am inclined to the view that this is unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, it must be understood that any agent of the applicant who participates in the mediation must have authority to settle the matter, or the capacity to obtain such authority almost immediately, and certainly on the day of the mediation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In other words, there must be someone available, in France, whatever the time might be, who can settle the matter on behalf of the applicant based upon nothing more than a telephone discussion, or an email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There is no point in conducting a mediation if protracted discussions requiring board approval have to be undertaken before the matter can be finally resolved, or if it will take some time to obtain a response from France.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">17 There still remains an outstanding issue in relation to the timing of the mediation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The applicant's position is that the mediation should proceed prior to the filing of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha would prefer that the mediation not take place until evidence has been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I propose to resolve this issue by ordering that the mediation take place on or before 6 October 2006, which is a date before evidence has been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In the event that the matter does not settle, it will come back to me for directions relating to the filing of evidence on 13 October 2006.</sentence>
