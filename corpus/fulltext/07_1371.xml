<sentence id="s0">
 
1 I am presently concerned with two Notices of Motion filed in the principal proceedings between Lynne Maree Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors , being proceedings QUD525/2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 Before dealing specifically with those Notices of Motion, it is helpful to set out the history of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 The proceedings were last before the Court on 5 December 2005, when I heard an interlocutory application for an injunction restraining one of the respondents in these proceedings from taking possession of property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I made no orders on that date, and adjourned the application pending the outcome of proceedings in the New South Wales Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 On 5 December 2005, I declined to reinstate proceedings QUD224/2004, which proceedings were brought by Gregory Eric Rogers, and which had been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">5 Subsequent to 5 December 2005, no step was taken in proceedings QUD525/2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 4 July 2006, that is to say, more than six months after the events on 5 December 2005, the file in these proceedings QUD525/2005 was closed due to inaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">6 On 11 August 2006, the file was reopened when the applicant filed a lengthy Statement of Claim of some 705 paragraphs over 70 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That Statement of Claim is substantially the same as had been filed by Mr Gregory Rogers in proceedings QUD130/2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">7 The first Notice of Motion of which I am concerned was filed on 19 September 2006 by Mrs Rogers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Notice of Motion sought directions that "a summary judgment hearing take place as a Defence had not been filed in the application within the time period set out in the Federal Court Rules ", as well as various other orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">8 The second Notice of Motion is one filed by the respondents on 20 September 2006 seeking the applicant's proceeding be dismissed, or, in the alternative, that they be permanently stayed, together with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">9 It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these proceedings in the name of Lynne Maree Rogers have been instituted, and then resurrected, because earlier proceedings brought by the applicant's husband were the subject of orders of dismissal in the light of the bankruptcy of Gregory Rogers and the decision by his trustee in bankruptcy not to pursue those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">10 The gravamen of the complaints in the present Statement of Claim are essentially a replica of claims made by the applicant's husband in the earlier proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">11 Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 was concerned with applications for relief by Mr Rogers, who sought various orders, including interlocutory relief restraining the respondents from exercising a power of sale, and in respect of a number of loan agreements, deeds of settlement, mortgages, and other instruments relating to various properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">12 Greenwood J found, as the respondents in that proceeding had submitted, that the majority of Mr Rogers' claims for final relief involved claims that related to the legal or beneficial interest of the applicant in property which vested in the trustee in bankruptcy, and accordingly in respect of which the applicant had no standing to institute legal proceedings pursuant to s 116(2)(g) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the Bankruptcy Act ):
 
 
 (g) any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation; 
 
 
 
 
 (i) for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt;
 ...
 
 
 

13 In those proceedings, Greenwood J held, at [48]: 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">

14 His Honour also concluded that a claim by Mr Rogers for interlocutory relief in the form of "an order that the respondents do not harass, intimidate or coerce the applicant, his family or neighbours" was not a claim called in aid of a claim for final relief within the scope of s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">15 After the judgment of Greenwood J, Mr Rogers filed an Amended Statement of Claim on 19 June 2006, seeking, in conformity with observations of Greenwood J, to formulate a Statement of Claim so as to plead claims coming within the exemption of s 116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">16 On 7 December 2006, Collier J held that the proceedings by Mr Rogers in QUD130/2006 commenced by application filed 7 April 2006 by Mr Rogers, and in which the Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 19 June 2006, be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">17 Her Honour held that in respect of each of the applicant's claims, the applicant either did not have standing, or the claims were not actionable in the Federal Court, or the pleadings were deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Her Honour held that the applicant should not be given a further opportunity to replead, and dismissed the applicant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">18 The earlier proceedings by Mr Rogers, namely QUD224/2004, was the subject of orders by me on 6 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In that action, the Court ordered:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The action QUD 224/2004 is deemed abandoned by operation of s60(3) of the The Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The proceeding is struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">No order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">

19 The Statement of Claim relevant to the present motions seeks to canvass much of the material the subject of the orders of the Court in the previous proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">20 Something of the flavour of that Statement of Claim can be gleaned from the allegations in par 25 that the third respondent:
 
 Has a propensity to engage in sophisticated well-developed "stings", and has previously been involved in scams ...
 

21 Paragraph 27 of the Statement of Claim says:
 
 Hare bragged to the applicant's husband that he has been in hundred's [sic] of court cases and never lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

22 The Statement of Claim pleads, at par 39, concerning the fourth respondent:
 
 Percival was married to Leanne Percival who was --- is a director of the Sixth Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Leanne Percival left Russell Percival when she found out that he had burgled the applicant's husband's home in company with his young Asian student girlfriend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">

23 Of the fifth respondent, par 43 of the Statement of Claim, pleads:
 
 Judith Hare forged a document that purported that she signed it on 3 October 2003 authorising the applicant's husband to buy a property in Palmwood Drive ((see Para 316) for herself and the Sixth Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">

24 Under headings labelled "Count 1" down to "Count 29", the Statement of Claim pleads various causes of action mainly under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
25 The relief sought by Mrs Rogers is:
 
 
 705 The sum of $45,000,000.00 for personal injury, harm or wrongs or such amount or other orders determined by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

 706 The applicant seeks any other orders that the court deems fit as will compensate the applicant and her family from the conduct of the respondents pursuant to the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 

26 While there are some differences, this Statement of Claim is, in essence, the same document filed by Mr Rogers in proceedings QUD130/2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">27 The first Notice of Motion by Mrs Rogers was made returnable on 12 October 2006, and sought orders:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Directions
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>

<sentence id="s64">
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Any further orders that the court deems fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">

28 That Notice of Motion does not, in turn, seek summary judgment in default of filing of a defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">What is sought in the prayer for relief number 3 does not appear to be included in any of the relief claimed in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The prayer for relief number 4 extends to the applicant's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">29 The Notice of Motion filed by the six respondents on 20 September 2006 sought orders:
 
 1 That the Applicant's proceeding against the Respondents be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">2 Alternatively, that the Applicant's proceeding be permanently stayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 3 That the Applicant pay the Respondents' costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed and paid forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 
 

30 Relevant to the proceedings in this matter on 5 December 2005 was the circumstance that there were relevant matters on foot in the New South Wales Supreme Court on 6 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">31 On 6 December 2005, despite the respondents agreeing by consent to the judgment of the New South Wales Supreme Court being set aside, there was no appearance by or on behalf of Mrs Rogers before the New South Wales Supreme Court on 6 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Those proceedings were adjourned to 12 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">32 On that day, Mr Rogers appeared before the New South Wales Supreme Court on behalf of his wife, and notwithstanding that counsel for the respondents advised the Court that the respondents consented to the judgment previously made in the New South Wales Supreme Court being set aside, Mr Rogers, on his wife's behalf, moved the Court for orders that Mrs Rogers' application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">33 In consequence, on 12 December 2005, the New South Wales Supreme Court struck out Mrs Rogers' summons and ordered that she pay the respondents' costs of the hearing on 6 and 12 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">34 As noted above, this file was closed on 4 July 2006 because no action had been taken for six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It was only after the publication of that action by the registry that the voluminous Statement of Claim by Mrs Rogers was filed on 11 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">35 My conclusions can be summarily stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">36 I have analysed the extensive Statement of Claim in considerable detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 434 and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">37 I have, in addition, had regard to two affidavits of Lynne Rogers filed on 19 September 2006, and the two affidavits of James Sean Whittle, a solicitor for the respondents, which was filed, in Court, on the hearing of the two motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">38 Notwithstanding the voluminous material in the Statement of Claim, the concern of Mrs Rogers in these proceedings as at December 2005 was directed at obtaining orders in relation to property at Fingal in New South Wales, which had been the subject of orders of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the matter 5702/2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">39 In the proceedings before me, Mrs Rogers alleged that the respondents were seeking to enforce an improperly obtained consent judgment and writ in respect of the Fingal property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The respondents acknowledged that the judgment entered in the New South Wales Supreme Court did not accord with the terms upon which the respondent in the New South Wales matter, namely Mrs Rogers, consented to judgment being entered against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">40 I was informed that Mrs Rogers had applied for that judgment to be set aside, and I was told by the respondents that they had agreed to consent to that judgment being set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">41 There was no agreement or acknowledgment by or on behalf of the respondents that they would consent to a variation of the judgment in the New South Wales Supreme Court so as to accord with the terms upon which Mrs Rogers had consented to judgment being entered against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">42 It is in that context that the conduct of Mr Rogers, on behalf of his wife, on 12 December 2005, has to be judged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">43 Mr Rogers is in error when he asserted, as he did on 12 October 2006, that:
 
 The solicitors for the respondents undertook to, your Honour, not to set aside that fraudulent judgment, but to place in lieu of that judgment, the correct judgment that the deed anticipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">(transcript of proceedings, p9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">

44 Looking at the matter broadly, the allegations of Mrs Rogers in the Statement of Claim filed in proceedings QUD525/2005, are substantially the same as the allegations set out in Mr Rogers' Amended Statement of Claim in the matter QUD130/2006 filed by him in that proceeding on or about 20 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">That Further Amended Statement of Claim comprised some 706 paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">45 Having regard to the detailed consideration of the allegations in Mr Rogers' proceedings, QUD130/2006, it is right to order that these proceedings by Lynne Maree Rogers against each of the respondents be dismissed, and that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to those proceedings and the Notices of Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">46 In addition to the reasons contained in Collier Js reasons for judgment in proceedings QUD130/2006, it should be noted that by a deed of settlement dated 4 August 2006, Mrs Rogers acknowledged that loan moneys borrowed by Mr Rogers and Living Space Holdings Pty Ltd from Asset Loan Company Pty Ltd had been secured by, amongst other things, guarantees provided by Lynne Rogers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Mrs Rogers had provided security and the registered mortgagee was entitled to pursue its rights pursuant to that mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">47 It seems to me plain that the present Statement of Claim has to be seen against the deliberate decision on Mrs Rogers' behalf on 12 December 2005 to ask the New South Wales Supreme Court to dismiss her application in respect of the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">48 It is true that the judgment, as recorded, involved a typographical error, which does not reflect the consent given by Mrs Rogers to the making of that judgment, but the offer by the respondents in that proceeding to have the judgment set aside was not acceded to by Mrs Rogers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">49 Having regard to the entirety of the material, it is appropriate to order that the application by Lynne Maree Rogers in QUD525/05 be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">50 It follows that the relief sought by her Notice of Motion filed 19 September 2006 is not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">51 I proceeded in this matter on the basis of O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">That rule provides the Court with the power to stay or dismiss proceedings generally, or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding where it appears:
 
 (a) No reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
 (b) The proceeding is frivolous or vexatious; or
 (c) The proceeding is an abuse of the process of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">

52 I have proceeded under O 20 r 2 rather than under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That section was inserted by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It applies to all cases commenced on or after 1 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">53 The Explanatory Memorandum to the amendment identifies that the "no reasonable prospects of success test" is designed to allow the court greater flexibility in giving summary judgment than the previous "no reasonable cause of action" test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">54 According to the Explanatory Memorandum, the purpose of s 31A was to introduce a lower standard for summary dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">55 The application by Mrs Rogers was filed two days before s 31A came into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I have therefore proceeded under O 20 r 2 which tests are said to be more stringent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.</sentence>
