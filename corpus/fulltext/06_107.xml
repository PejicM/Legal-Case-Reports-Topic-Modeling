 1 This is an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs ("Customs") from a decision made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") on 22 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal's decision concerns the proper classification under Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Customs Tariff Act ") of certain goods imported by the respondent over the period from 2002 to 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Under s 44 of the AAT Act , this Court exercises original jurisdiction in hearing such an appeal, and the appeal is confined to questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Court is empowered to make such order on the appeal as it thinks appropriate, including orders affirming or setting aside the decision of the Tribunal or an order remitting the case to be heard and decided again by the Tribunal in accordance with the directions of the Court: see s 44(4) and (5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">BACKGROUND 
 
3 The respondent imports goods which the Tribunal described as 'insect mating disruption products'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The relevant importations concern four products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Two of them targets codling moth in apples and pears, a third targets light brown apple moth in apples and grapes, and a fourth targets oriental fruit moth in peaches and nectarines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In these reasons for judgment, I shall refer to them collectively as 'the products'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The products work by releasing large quantities of synthetic female pheromones into the air in fruit orchards, thereby confusing male moths and preventing them from finding and mating with female moths of their species.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The relevant moths have a short life cycle, typically seven to ten days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Over time, the products can eliminate or significantly reduce particular moth populations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 None of the products could be described as merely a chemical or mixture of chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">As the Tribunal said:
 
 "The subject goods are dispensers consisting of two parallel tubes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">One tube contains a piece of wire to provide stiffness and the other is filled with a controlled release formulation consisting of a synthetic pheromone and sealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The subject goods are presented in two forms: a pair of parallel tubes as described or a pair of parallel tubes of a slightly smaller diameter that have been twisted into twist-tie dispensers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">" 


The dispensing tubes are made of plastic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">They are designed to be tied to the branches of trees in fruit orchards and to allow the pheromones to gradually seep into the air as a vapour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The respondent imports the products from Japan, which is not a Preference Country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Accordingly, duty payable on the importation of the products is to be calculated in accordance with s 16(1)(a) of the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 On 5 August 2002, the respondent through its customs broker, LEP International Pty Ltd, lodged an application for a tariff advice in respect of the products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 16 August 2002, Customs gave a decision on this tariff advice classifying the products under sub-heading 3808.10.90 of Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The respondent subsequently sought internal reviews of the tariff classification, but Customs twice confirmed its classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 As it is permitted to do under s 167 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) ("the Customs Act "), the respondent paid customs duty under protest in respect of multiple entries of the products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It then sought review of the decisions by Customs to demand the duty that it paid under protest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In respect of all but one of the entries, the respondent sought to review the decision within six months of having paid the duty under protest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal reviewed those decisions under s 273GA(2) of the Customs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In respect of one further entry, the respondent applied for a refund of duty which it had paid under protest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal reviewed Customs' decision to refuse this refund application pursuant to s 273GA(1)(haaa).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">All of the decisions under review were made on the basis that the products should be classified under sub-heading 3808.10.90 of Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 The Tribunal determined that the products should be classified under a different sub-heading, namely 2905.29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">By notice of appeal dated 10 February 2005, Customs lodged an appeal to this Court on the ground that the Tribunal had erred in law in the tariff classification it adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">THE ALTERNATIVE CLASSIFICATIONS 
 
10 Customs classified the products under sub-heading 3808.10.90 of Sch 3 to the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This provision needs to be read in its broader context:
 
 "3808 INSECTICIDES, RODENTICIDES, FUNGICIDES, HERBICIDES, ANTI-SPROUTING PRODUCTS AND PLANT-GROWTH REGULATORS, DISINFECTANTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS, PUT UP IN FORMS OR PACKINGS FOR RETAIL SALE OR AS PREPARATIONS OR ARTICLES (FOR EXAMPLE, SULPHUR-TREATED BANDS, WICKS AND CANDLES, AND FLY-PAPERS): 
 
 3808.10 - Insecticides: 
 
 
 
 3808.10.10 --- Goods as follows: Free 
 (a) camphor; 
 (b) fly-papers; 
 (c) mosquito spirals and coils 
 
 3808.10.90 --- Other 5% 
 
 3808.20.00 - Fungicides 5% 
 
 3808.30.00 - Herbicides, anti-sprouting products and 
 plant-growth regulators 5% 
 
 3808.40.00 - Disinfectants 5% 
 
 3808.90.00 - Other 5%" 
 

11 Before the Tribunal, Customs contended that the only other classifications that were potentially open were sub-heading 3808.90.00 (see above) or sub-heading 3824.90.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The last mentioned sub-heading appears in the following context:
 
 "3824 PREPARED BINDERS FOR FOUNDRY MOULDS OR CORES; CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AND PREPARATIONS OF THE CHEMICAL OR ALLIED INDUSTRIES (INCLUDING THOSE CONSISTING OF MIXTURES OF NATURAL PRODUCTS), NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED OR INCLUDED: 
 ... 
 
 3824.90.90 -- Other 5%" 
 

12 The Tribunal accepted the respondent's submission that the products should be classified to sub-heading 2905.29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In context, it reads as follows:
 
 "2905 ACYCLIC ALCOHOLS AND THEIR HALOGENATED, SULPHONATED, NITRATED OR NITROSATED DERIVATIVES: 
 
 ... 
 
 2905.2 - Unsaturated monohydric alcohols: 
 
 
 
 2905.29.00 -- Other Free" 
 
 SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
13 Since the Tribunal's decision and the institution of this appeal, the parties have come to an agreement as to the proper classification of the products and as to the way in which the appeal should be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">14 The parties have agreed that the Tribunal erred in law in its classification of the products, and that they should have been classified under sub-heading 3808.10.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In other words, they have agreed that the classification adopted by Customs was correct in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">On the footing that this is the relevant classification, the parties have also agreed that some of the products were covered by Tariff Concession Order 0302437 ("the TCO") made pursuant to s 273 of the Customs Act and Item 50A of Sch 4 to the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The effect of the TCO is that the particular goods to which it applied were rendered free from duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The operation and effect of the TCO was not appreciated by the parties until recently and was not drawn to the attention of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Assuming that the TCO applies, the demands for duty were erroneous in law to the extent of $44,557.55, and Customs would be required under s 163 of the Customs Act and r 126(1)(ea) of the Customs Regulations 1926 (Cth) to refund that amount to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">15 The appellant and the respondent have submitted proposed consent orders which provide as follows:
 
 "NOTING the undertaking of the Applicant to the Respondent that, subject to and in consequence of the making by the Court of the orders set out below, the Applicant will, by reason of the application of Tariff Concession Order TC 0302437 and having regard to regulation 126 (1)(ea) of the Customs Regulations 1926 , pay to the Respondent within 30 days the sum of $44,557.55 as a refund of overpaid customs duty, THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The decision of the Tribunal dated 22 December 2004 be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In lieu thereof, there be a decision that: 
 (a) the decision of the Collector be varied so as to reduce the amount demanded by the sum of $44,557.55; 
 (b) otherwise the decision of the Collector (whereby the goods the subject of the decision were classified to item 3808.10.90 of Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 ) be affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The parties shall bear their own costs of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">" 


The purpose of the recited undertaking is to give effect to the respondent's entitlement under the TCO to a refund of duty of $44,557.55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">16 The proposed consent orders relate to a matter of public law, and would involve setting aside a carefully reasoned decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It would be inappropriate for me to accede to the orders that have been sought, simply because they are consent orders, without satisfying myself that the Tribunal in fact erred in law, and that the correct tariff classification of the products is under sub-heading 3808.10.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Further, if I were to be so satisfied, I also consider that I should identify the error of law by the Tribunal which founds the orders I am asked to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">That can be done either in these reasons or in any order I pronounce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I will take the former course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">17 The principles which apply in this situation are not in doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In Kovalev v Minister for Immigration [1999] FCA 557 ; (2000) 100 FCR 323 (" Kovalev ") at 326-328, French J explained the relevant principles:
 
 "In making a consent order the Court exercises judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is a power conferred upon it by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Its exercise is a public function and operates to bind the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Its public character applies to agreed orders disposing of private litigation between citizens or corporations and proceedings brought by or against governments and their agencies or public authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 An order disposing of proceedings by consent must be self-explanatory as must any order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is not appropriate to make an order of uncertain content or the content of which is to be derived from materials which are not on the public record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 There is a fundamental difficulty where a court makes an order remitting a matter to a decision-maker or tribunal to be decided 'according to law' and the court itself is not informed of the nature of the error conceded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The court is then making an order without being apprised of its basis and proposed operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To do so in my opinion is a purported, but not an actual exercise of judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Moreover, in a practical sense the decision-maker or tribunal lacks the benefit of any binding direction from the court as to precisely what it is that the decision-maker or tribunal is required to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In the present case the precise concession which led to the proposed consent order had not been communicated by the respondent to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The possibility arose that the matter could have been remitted to the Tribunal with the parties themselves not being ad idem as to the error of law which had led to the decision being set aside and which the Tribunal was required to rectify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">And even if there had been such an agreement the terms of the order proposed would not have disclosed to the public what the parties had agreed should be its content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In the particular case where a tribunal decision is set aside, the Tribunal itself is not usually a party and has played no role in the negotiation of the agreement that it erred in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">A fortiori in that case the order must be clear and complete and the Court must be satisfied that it is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
 ... 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It is well-established that in making a consent order or indeed in accepting undertakings the Court must have regard to the limits of its power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The parties cannot, by consent, confer power on the Court to make orders which the Court lacks power to make --- Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission ( 1981 ) [1981] HCA 48 ; 148 CLR 150 at 163.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The question whether a consent order is to be made, is not concluded by a finding that it is formally within the power of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In the exercise of its power the Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute (WA) Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86 and the authorities referred to there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is important therefore that the Court itself addresses and is satisfied of the basis upon which its order is to be made and in particular where the order sets aside the decision of an official decision-maker or a tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 ... 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In the case of error of law attributed to a decision-maker or tribunal there is a particular public interest which requires the Court's specification of the error and its satisfaction that error occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 It is also a substantial discourtesy for a court to overturn the decision of an official decision-maker and a fortiori that of a statutory tribunal without consideration of the error that leads to the decision being overturned or communication of the terms of that error to the decision-maker or tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">If such a determination is to be set aside on the basis that it has failed to apply or has misapplied the law whether substantive or procedural, there may potentially be some precedential impact in other like cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">To permit the principle underlying the order to be formulated only by the parties in their submissions to the decision-maker or the Tribunal leaves the content of that principle in the hands of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">" 


As French J noted, Sackville J had adopted a similar approach in Sanchez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 265.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Subsequently, Stone J in Yulianti v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 142 agreed with the views expressed by French J and Sackville J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Her Honour observed in addition that the grounds for the making of the order can appear in the Court's reasons for judgment, rather than in the order itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Similar views were expressed by RD Nicholson J in Xiao v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 459 ; (2001) 109 FCR 129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The principles explained by French J in Kovalev have been approved numerous times: see Re Allan and Repatriation Commission (2003) 77 ALD 140 at 144-145 [12]-[14]; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 132 FCR 93 at 110 [55] - [56] ; and WAKM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 730 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS 
 
18 The Tribunal correctly observed that Note 2 to Sec VI of Sch 3 and Note 1(a)(2) to Ch 38 of Sch 3 required that the Tribunal first consider whether the products came within heading 3808 before considering whether they came within any other heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">If the products were classifiable to heading 3808, they could not be classified elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">19 The Tribunal held that the products were not classifiable under heading 3808 as insecticides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In summary, the Tribunal reasoned that, as there was no trade or technical meaning for the word 'insecticide', the ordinary meaning of the word must be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Its ordinary meaning was that of 'a substance or preparation for the killing of insects either by direct or indirect means'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It followed that the products were not classifiable to heading 3808, as the evidence showed that the products did not kill insects either directly or indirectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">20 The Tribunal did not consider that there was any ambiguity in the meaning of 'insecticide' in heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Consequently, it considered that there was no need to have resort to the explanatory notes to the harmonised commodity description and coding system ("the Harmonised System Notes").</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Harmonised System Notes were developed by the committee established by the Convention on Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs, Brussels in 1950.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal said that while the Harmonised System Notes are a recognised extrinsic aid to the construction of headings in the Customs Tariff, they are a secondary guide only and cannot displace the plain words of the statute or be used where there is no ambiguity in the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In these circumstances, the Tribunal considered that there should be no recourse to the Harmonised System Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">However, the Tribunal added that even if there were ambiguity in the meaning of the word 'insecticide', and regard were had to the Harmonised System Notes, the products would still not be classifiable under heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">This was because none of the products had a repellent effect or an attractant effect within the meaning of the Harmonised System Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">21 The Tribunal also held that the products were not similar products within heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The reference to 'similar products' must be read as relating to all seven products that precede it, and so requires a finding as to the class or genus of goods common to all of the proceeding words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal expressed its conclusions on this issue as follows:
 
 "86.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">We must determine what is common class in all of the words in heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">What is common is that they all have a pathological effect on either plant or insect life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In the case of those that kill (insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides, some herbicides and disinfectants), that pathological effect is fatal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In those that control (other herbicides and anti-sprouting products, plant growth regulators), that pathological effect inhibits or regulates growth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Inhibition or regulation relates to the growth of the plant itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It does not extend to such matters as its reproduction even though inhibition or regulation may lead to its not reproducing by the production of seed, tubers or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Pathological effect on an organism produces growth changes, disease or death in that organism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">We have already found that the subject goods do not have any pathological effect on the moths to either kill them or to inhibit or regulate their growth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Their effect is only physiological and, once outside the range of the subject goods, not ongoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Therefore, the subject goods are not of the class or genus to which the products in heading 3808 belong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">" 
 

22 Having found that the products were not classifiable under heading 3808, including in particular sub-heading 3808.10.90, the Tribunal considered other headings in Sch 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It held that the products could not fall within heading 3824 because it could not be said that they wholly comprised 'chemical products'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">While the products included chemicals, they comprised much more; they were dispensing devices manufactured from wire, plastic and chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">23 The Tribunal then considered whether the products could be classified under sub-heading 2905.29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Tribunal held that it was appropriate to classify each product under this sub-heading having regard to the provisions of r 3(b) of Sch 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Schedule 2 contains General Interpretation Rules for Sch 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Where this rule applies, goods can be classified as if they consisted of the material or component giving them their essential character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In the case of each of the products, the Tribunal found that it derived its essential character from its active chemical component.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In each case that component was, or was a derivative of, an unsaturated monohydric alcohol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">THE TRIBUNAL'S ERRORS OF LAW 
 
24 I am satisfied that the Tribunal erred in its classification of the products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In my opinion, the products should be classified under sub-heading 3808.10.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">They are not classifiable under sub-heading 2905.29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">My reasons for reaching this conclusion are set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">25 I am also satisfied that the erroneous classification of the products amounts to an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">There has been some debate about whether a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of a word used in a statutory provision can of itself amount to an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549 at 564-565, Lockhart J said:
 
 "I now turn to a submission made on behalf of the appellants that the question which was before the Customs for determination in this case was one of fact and that the primary judge erred in treating it as a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Reliance was placed upon the principle that, where a word is an ordinary English word, its meaning is not a question of law and, accordingly, whether the facts of a given case fall within that meaning is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Reference was made to Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 29 ALR 577 at 580-2; [1980] HCA 16 ; 144 CLR 1 at 6-8 (per Mason J); Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (No 2) (1980) 3 ALD 38 at 49-51 (per Fisher J) and at 55-6 (per Sheppard J); and Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854, esp at 861 (per Lord Reid) where his Lordship said: 'The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The proper construction of a statute is a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider, not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If it is alleged that the tribunal has reached a wrong decision then there can be a question of law, but only of a limited character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The question would normally be whether their decision was unreasonable in the sense that no tribunal acquainted with the ordinary use of language could reasonably reach that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">' 
 
 In my opinion this principle has no application in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">If taken to its logical conclusion the appellants' argument really asserts that it is for the Customs to say in each case whether any, and if so which, provision of the Tariff applies to particular goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">But it is not a question of the Customs simply determining whether particular goods fall within the meaning of ordinary English words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">What the Customs would be deciding, if the appellants are correct, is whether the description of particular goods falls within particular chapters, items, sub-items, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs of the Tariff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It must be a question of law whether a given description of goods falls within a particular part of the Tariff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Here the question is what particular part of the relevant Schedule, if any, applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">This necessarily involves a question of construction of the Tariff and is a question of law: see Whitton v Falkiner [1915] HCA 38 ; (1915) 20 CLR 118, per Isaacs J (at 127).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">" 
 

See also Fox J at 555-556.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">26 In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 396-397, the High Court expressed reservations about the supposed distinction between the ordinary meaning of words, which is said to raise a question of fact, and the construction and effect of a term or provision which is said to raise a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The Court said:
 
 "With respect this distinction seems artificial, if not illusory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The meaning attributed to individual words in a phrase ultimately dictates the effect or construction that one gives to the phrase when taken as a whole and the approach that one adopts in determining the meaning of the individual words of that phrase is bound up in the syntactical construction of the phrase in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In R v Brown, a recent House of Lords decision, Lord Hoffmann said: 
 
 
 'The fallacy in the Crown's argument is, I think, one common among lawyers, namely to treat the words of an English sentence as building blocks whose meaning cannot be affected by the rest of the sentence ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">This is not the way language works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The unit of communication by means of language is the sentence and not the parts of which it is composed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The significance of individual words is affected by other words and the syntax of the whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">' 
 
 
 If the notions of meaning and construction are interdependent, as we think they are, then it is difficult to see how meaning is a question of fact while construction is a question of law without insisting on some qualification concerning construction that is currently absent from the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">" 
 

However, the Court did not find it necessary to resolve this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">27 Subsequently, the issue was discussed at some length by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare Pty Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1997) 72 FCR 467 (" Baxter Healthcare ") in a most helpful judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">His Honour said at 471-472:
 
 "A preliminary point should be mentioned, since it is important, although little attention was paid to it in argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Where there is a question whether something falls within a verbal description in a statute (as in a case raising the application of a tariff item), the answer may depend simply on findings of fact as to the meaning of the words constituting the description and as to the nature of the thing itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">With regard to the words, '[t]he question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in [a] Statute is one of fact not of law': Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 137 per Jordan CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Nevertheless, once the nature of the thing has been found as a fact, whether it falls within the verbal description will, in many cases, be a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For, in the first place, it may not be a matter of applying merely the ordinary English meaning of words or phrases, but of applying a meaning derived from the statute by a process of construction, which is a process of law: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 10 per Mason J, with whose reasons Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ stated their agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The principle that construction is a process of law has never been doubted, although the completeness of the proposition derived from it that '[t]he effect or construction of a term once its meaning or interpretation is established is a matter of law': Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs (1994) 124 ALR 645 at 648 per Gummow J; Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (at 287), and the relationship between that proposition and the proposition that the meaning of an ordinary word or phrase is a matter of fact, were left in some doubt when Agfa-Gevaert v Collector of Customs was reversed on appeal by the High Court: see Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 395-397.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 
 Gummow J, in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs , also held (ibid) that it is a question of law 'whether the facts as found fall within the terms of the law as properly construed; to this there is the qualification that, where the statute uses words according to their ordinary meaning and it is reasonably open to hold that the facts as found fall within those words, the decision as to whether they do so fall generally is a matter of fact'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">His Honour added that the limitation 'generally' was required, even in this last case, 'because the law may use a word in an ordinary sense, but there may be a number of ordinary senses and it then is necessary to select that which is appropriate, and because whilst the word may have but one ordinary meaning that is imprecise, the word will take its colour from the context and that will require construction of the law, a lawyer's task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The result in such cases will be more than the matching of a set of facts with plain words'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The proposition that 'whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law' was stated to be sustained by '[m]any authorities' in the judgment of Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council (at 7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The same proposition was subsequently applied by Full Courts of this Court to cases where what was in issue was whether facts as found fell within the provision of a tariff item: Peacock v Zyfert (1983) 48 ALR 549; Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285 at 293, 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">" 
 

28 Burchett J recognised that complexities can arise in the application of these principles, and for that reason he said that at least two qualifications should be added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">29 The first qualification arises where a statute uses a word whose meaning is clear but the word is inherently capable of more than one application or outcome in the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In such a case, the question whether the statutory description is satisfied will often be simply a question of fact: see, for example, the discussion of Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854 by Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7-8; and see also Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (1995) 59 FCR 6 at 14-15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">30 The second qualification arises where there is uncertainty as to the meaning of a statutory word or expression, and that uncertainty can be resolved by construing the word according to its context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">That process raises a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Burchett J explained why this is so in the following passage at 473-474: 
 
 "In such a case, a court or tribunal does not choose between different possible applications of the one equivocal or inexact statutory concept (for example, 'insulting') to an evaluation or an appreciation (in the French sense --- see 69 ALJ 984) of the facts, but chooses upon the principles of construction between possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Of course, it is conceivable that a particular provision in an enactment will raise both kinds of problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">But Gummow J's remarks in Agfa-Gevaert Ltd v Collector of Customs seem to me to involve that, where the susceptibility of words and expressions to different meanings or shades of meaning is to be resolved by a process of construction of the statutory language in order to determine whether it embraces the facts found, the ultimate question is one of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">This accords with the view of Fullagar J in Hayes v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) , with Hope at 10, and with the joint judgment of Sheppard and Burchett JJ in Australian National Railways Commission v Collector of Customs (SA) (1985) 8 FCR 264 at 277.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd at 397, the joint judgment of the High Court refers to the principle 'that the determination of whether an "Act uses [an] expression ... in any other sense than that which they have [scilicet, it has] in ordinary speech" is always a question of law'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">On that basis, logically it must also be a question of law, in a case where a statutory expression has several ordinary senses, whether it is used in a particular one of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">And as the joint judgment of Neaves, French and Cooper JJ in Pozzolanic Enterprises points out (at 288-289), uncertainties may require to be resolved by reference to a value judgment about the range of the Act, rather than a matching of the facts to the, or an, ordinary meaning of the words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Their Honours said: 
 
 'Although the words of the statute are construed according to their ordinary English meaning, that does not mean that their application to a set of facts is simply described as the matching of that set of facts with a factual description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">There is necessarily a selection process involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The range of relationships to which the words apply for the purpose of the Act depends upon a judgment about that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The selection process involved is analogous to that used in determining what causal relationships between conduct and loss attract liability for the purpose of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act (1974) (Cth): see Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 418-419; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 58 FCR 274 at 286-288; 84 ALR 700 at 712-713.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In the end this is not a process of fact finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The facts are found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">What is left is a value judgment about the range of the Act and that is a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">' 
 
 
 This passage was referred to in the joint judgment of the High Court, without criticism, in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd at 395.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">" 
 

31 For the reasons set out hereunder, the errors made by the Tribunal go beyond a mistake as to the ordinary meaning of the term 'insecticide' or a mistake in matching the meaning of that term to the proven facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In my opinion, the Tribunal erred in the way in which it construed headings 3808 and 2905.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In particular, it failed to give effect to the statutory context in which those provisions appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">THE PRODUCTS ARE INSECTICIDES 
 
32 The Tribunal held that the term insecticide in heading 3808 should be given its ordinary meaning, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">a substance or preparation for the killing of insects either by direct or indirect means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Depending on its context, this is an available meaning of the word, but in my opinion it is an unduly narrow meaning in the context of heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">33 In adopting this meaning of 'insecticide', the Tribunal had regard to the Latin root of the suffix 'cide'; it derives from 'caedere' meaning to cut or to kill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Tribunal also had regard to the way in which words were grouped in the heading and sub-heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In particular, the Tribunal placed weight on the fact that anti-sprouting products and plant-growth regulators were grouped with herbicides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The Tribunal said that this indicated that the terms which connoted control, or both control and/or killing, were separated from those that were directed at killing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">34 In my opinion, neither of these factors is compelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The word 'insecticide' can be applied to substances that control or repel insects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">For instance, Webster's Third International Dictionary (1971) includes as a broad definition of insecticide 'an agent hostile or repellent to insects...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The same dictionary defines 'insecticidal' as '(1) destroying or controlling insects'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">I would not attach the same weight as the Tribunal did to the grouping of terms in the sub-headings to 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">There may be other reasons for grouping herbicides with plant-growth regulators and anti-sprouting products, such as the simple fact that both are concerned with plants rather than with insects or other organisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">35 The Tribunal placed some reliance upon the following observations of Griffith CJ in Markwell v Wollaston [1906] HCA 91 ; (1906) 4 CLR 141 (" Markwell v Wollaston ") at 148:
 
 "In my opinion, the term insecticide, as commonly used in English, means, or at any rate includes, any preparation in the nature of a drug or chemical adapted solely or mainly to the destruction of insect life, and the effect of which is produced either by immediate contact with the insect or by some influence fatal to insect life inherent in or emanating from the preparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">" 
 

It is noteworthy that Griffiths CJ did not confine the common meaning of insecticide to preparations aimed solely or mainly at the destruction of insect life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He expressly recognised that in common usage the term insecticide might be broader than the meaning he was concerned to address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">36 What is of much greater significance is that heading 3808 and its sub-headings contain other indications that the word 'insecticide' is used in a way that embraces products that are designed to exterminate, reduce, repel or control targeted insect populations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Sub-heading 3808.10, 'Insecticides', is elaborated by sub-headings 3808.10.10 and 3808.10.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Sub-heading 3808.10.10 provides that certain types of insecticides, namely camphor, fly papers and mosquito spirals and coils, are to be free of duty, whereas other insecticides attract duty at the rate of 5 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">We know from Markwell v Wollaston that the mixture of oil and resin that is smeared on fly paper is a preparation that falls within the ordinary meaning of the term 'insecticide'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The terms 'camphor' and 'mosquito coils' are defined in the Macquarie Dictionary (3 rd Ed) as follows:
 
 "Camphor --- 1. a bicyclic, aliphatic, terpenoid ketone, C 10 H 16 O, obtained chiefly from the camphor laurel or by synthesis, and used in medicine, the manufacture of celluloid, etc. 2. any of various similar substances, for household use as an insect deterrent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
 
 Mosquito coil --- a stiff coil of insect-repellent material, which, when set on a stand and ignited, burns slowly and releases insect-repellent smoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">" 


By treating camphor and mosquito coils as insecticides, it is apparent that heading 3808 and its sub-headings use the term 'insecticide' so as to include chemicals or products which repel or deter insects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The term is not used in a way which is confined to chemicals which directly or indirectly kill or exterminate insects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">37 The examples given in parentheses in heading 3808, namely sulphur treated bands, wicks and candles and fly papers, provide another indicator that points in the same direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The first two examples suggest that the word 'insecticides' in heading 3808 is intended to include products that repel insects or that in some way modify the behaviour or physiology of insects so as to render them less pestilent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">38 The Tribunal failed to take these contextual indications into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Both sets of indications support a wider meaning of 'insecticide' than that adopted by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">39 At the very least, the examples in heading 3808 and the references to camphor and mosquito spirals and coils in sub-heading 3808.10.10 suggest that there is some ambiguity about the way in which the term insecticide is used in the heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">To adapt the language used by Burchett J in Baxter Healthcare , a legal choice must be made about possible concepts conveyed by the statutory expression, and in making that choice it is appropriate to take account of the intent and purpose of the Customs Tariff Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In my opinion, it would have been permissible for the Tribunal to have regard to the Harmonised System Notes as an extrinsic aid to the interpretation of heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Where the language of a heading is ambiguous or susceptible to different interpretations, the Harmonised System Notes are an appropriate extrinsic aid to interpretation: Gardner Smith v Collector of Customs Victoria (1986) 66 ALR 377 at 383-384; Barry R Liggins Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1991) 103 ALR 565 at 571-573; and Toyota Tsusho Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs [1992] FCA 282 at [22] - [30] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">40 The Tribunal went on to hold that it would have reached the same conclusion about the meaning of the term insecticide even if it had regard to Note (I) to Item 38.08 of the Harmonised System Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal focused on two particular phrases in Note (I) and asked itself the question whether the products had a repellent or attractant effect of the kind described in Note (I).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It was common ground on the evidence that the products were not repellents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The expert witnesses disagreed as to whether or not the products were attractants in a general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">However, the Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the products attracted moths to traps or poison baits, which it evidently considered to be the relevant question for the purposes of applying Note (I) to Item 38.08 of the Harmonised System Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">41 In my opinion, the Tribunal fell into error by not reading the Notes concerning Item 38.08 of the Harmonised System Notes as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Tribunal did not refer to the introductory parts of the relevant notes which contained the following statements:
 
 "Products intended to repel pests or used for disinfecting seeds are also classified here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 
 These insecticides, disinfectants, herbicides, fungicides etc., are applied by spraying, dusting, sprinkling, coating, impregnating, etc., or may necessitate combustion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">They achieve their results by nerve-poisoning, by stomach-poisoning, by asphyxiation or by odour, etc." 
 

42 The Tribunal extracted Note (I) of the Harmonised System Notes dealing with Item 38.08.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It states:
 
 "The products of heading 38.08 can be divided into the following groups: 
 
 
 (1) Insecticides include not only products for killing insects, but also those having a repellent or attractant effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The products may be in a variety of forms such as sprays or blocks (against moths), oils or sticks (against mosquitoes), powder (against ants), strips (against flies), cyanogen gas absorbed in diatomite or paperboard (against fleas and lice).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">
 
 
 Many insecticides are characterised by their mode of action or method of use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Among these are: 
 
 - insect growth regulators: chemicals which interfere with biochemical and physiological processes in insects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">
 - fumigants: chemicals which are distributed in the air as gases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">
 - chemosterilants: chemicals used to sterilise segments of an insect population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 - repellents: substances which prevent insect attack by making their food or living conditions unattractive or offensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 - attractants: used to attract insects to traps or poisoned baits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">" 
 
 

43 The Tribunal did not specifically refer to those parts of Note (I) which describe insect growth regulators as chemicals which interfere with biochemical and physiological processes in insects, or which describe chemosterilents as chemicals used to sterilise segments of an insect population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In effect, the Tribunal focused solely on two examples given towards the end of Note (I).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">They were simply examples of insecticides which adopt a particular mode of action in the course of functioning as repellents or attractants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In my opinion, the Tribunal did not appreciate the full significance of Note (I) because it failed to have regard to the overall content and context of the Note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">44 Nor did the Tribunal refer to the closing passage in the Notes to Item 38.08 which stated that the heading also includes products to control mites and ticks (acaricides), molluscs (molluscicides), nematodes (nematocides), rodents (rodenticides), birds (avicides), and other pests (e.g., lampreycides, predacides).</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">45 A fair reading of the Notes to Item 38.08 indicates that it was intended to cover substances which operate as repellents or attractants, or which operate to control insect populations in other ways such as by sterilisation or by chemicals which interfere with biochemical and physiological processes in insects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The Tribunal wrongly focused on the particular instances of repellents and attractants described in Note (I), without recognising that they were only examples of possible modes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">SIMILAR PRODUCTS 
 
46 The Tribunal held that it was necessary to find a class or genus of goods common to all of the particular descriptive words which proceed the phrase 'and similar products' in heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The appellant was critical of this approach, but there is nothing exceptional or unorthodox about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Such approach is commonly referred to as an application of the ejusdem generis rule, but it overstates its proper function to call it a rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">It is no more than a guide to interpretation and must be used cautiously: see Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (5 th Ed) at [4.19]-[4.24].</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The rule has been criticised by Mahoney JA in Mattinson v Multiplo Incubators Pty Ltd [1977] 1 NSWLR 368 at 373 and by Wells J in Brewarrana Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Highways (No 2) (1973) 6 SASR 541 at 587.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">There will be occasions when it is not appropriate to apply the rule having regard to the context and purpose of the particular statutory provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">There will also be occasions where the descriptive terms that precede the general words are so varied that it is futile to search for a single genus or class that can be of assistance in giving meaning to the general words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Conversely, there will be occasions where it is both sensible and appropriate to give meaning to the general words by identifying the class or genus that is indicated by the preceding particular words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">All in all, the surest approach is to give meaning to general words which follow particular words in a statutory provision by determining the meaning of those words in their context and by reference to the purpose of the provision, in the same way as meaning is given to other words in a statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">47 The Tribunal identified the class of goods in heading 3808 very narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">At the outset of its discussion of this issue, the Tribunal said that the class or genus of goods in heading 3808 is that they all relate to controlling living organisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In the end, however, the Tribunal adopted a much narrower formulation: the common class was identified as substances or products that have a pathological effect on either plant or insect life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In my opinion, this is too narrow a description of the relevant class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">When account is taken of all the contextual features I have described, it would be more appropriate to describe the class as products that have a controlling, deterring, inhibiting or exterminating effect on insects, rodents, fungi, plants or bacteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">If this approach were to be adopted, and if the products in question did not themselves constitute insecticides, it would have been open to the Tribunal to find that the products were similar products within the meaning of heading 3808.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">48 The appellant argued that it is sufficient in law if the goods in question are similar to any of the goods previously described by name, citing Acrow Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (1986) 12 FCR 129 at 132.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The appellant also submitted that if the Tribunal had asked itself the question whether the products in question were similar to insecticides, it would have been bound to answer the question affirmatively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">49 It is unnecessary for me to express any concluded view about this aspect of the appellant's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">I have some reservations about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It begs the question as to what standard of similarity is to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Moreover, if the term insecticides were properly defined in its statutory context in the narrow way that the Tribunal determined, it would not necessarily follow that the products were similar to insecticides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">THE PRODUCTS WERE NOT CLASSIFIABLE TO SUB-HEADING 2905.29.00 
 
50 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal erred in law in classifying the products under sub-heading 2905.29.00 because Ch 29 only applies to chemicals or mixtures of chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The products in question were not merely chemicals but rather devices for dispensing certain chemical agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">51 I agree with the appellant's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">When Ch 29 is read as a whole, it is clear that it is only intended to apply to chemicals, and not to dispensing devices that incorporate certain chemical agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">52 Note 1 to Ch 29 makes it fairly clear that the Chapter does not apply to manufactured dispensing devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">It provides:
 
 "Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this Chapter apply only to: 
 
 (a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds, whether or not containing impurities; 
 (b) Mixtures of two or more isomers of the same organic compound (whether or not containing impurities), except mixtures of acyclic hydrocarbon isomers (other than stereoisomers), whether or not saturated (Chapter 27); 
 (c) The products of 2936 to 2939 or the sugar ethers, sugar acetals and sugar esters, and their salts, of 2940, or the products of 2941, whether or not chemically defined; 
 (d) The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in water; 
 (e) The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution constitutes a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and that the solvent does not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; 
 (f) The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above with an added stabiliser (including an anti-caking agent) necessary for their preservation or transport; 
 (g) The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring or ordoriferous substance added to facilitate their identification or for safety reasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; 
 (h) The following products, diluted to standard strengths, for the production of azo dyes: diazonium salts, couplers used for these salts and diazotisable amines and their salts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">" 
 
 

53 Paragraph (a) of Note 1 provides a clear indication as to the scope of Ch 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Except where the context or other specific provisions otherwise require, it confines Ch 29 to 'separate chemically defined organic compounds, whether or not containing impurities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">While the language could be clearer, this paragraph indicates that Ch 29 is only intended to apply to things that are identifiable as consisting exclusively of chemical compounds, unless some special exception applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">There are exceptions mentioned in pars (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of the Note, but otherwise the intention appears to be that Ch 29 is only concerned with chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">54 Paragraph 1(e) of the Note provides another indication that Ch 29 does not apply to dispensing devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Its effect is that a chemical mixture will fall outside Ch 29 if the chemical compound in question is dissolved in a solvent for reasons other than safety or transport, or if the solvent renders the chemical particularly suitable for some specific commercial use rather than general use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">An earlier version of the same provision was explained and applied in Re Bayer Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1985) 7 ALN 84.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">That case concerned a chemical known as flumethrin which was the active ingredient in a cattle tick insecticide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The flumethrin was imported in 200 litre drums as a 60 per cent premix concentrate dissolved in a solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The Tribunal held that the chemical mixture was taken outside Ch 29 by the relevant paragraph of Note 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">This was because the addition of the solvent so as to make a standardised 60 per cent solution was not a normal and necessary method adopted solely for reasons of safety or for the purpose of transporting the goods as required by the Note; it was also adopted for several other reasons including the production of a workable solution at the place where final mixing takes place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">55 In my opinion, these indications are confirmed by a reading of the whole of Ch 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">56 The Tribunal did not examine Note 1 to Ch 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Nor did it specifically consider the question whether Ch 29 was confined to chemicals, and was incapable of applying to dispensing devices which incorporated a chemical dosage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Rather, the Tribunal moved directly to r 3 of Sch 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">57 So far as relevant, the General Rules of Interpretation in Sch 3 provide as follows:
 
 "1.</sentence>

<sentence id="s294">When by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie , classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows: 
 (a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">
 (b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">
 (c) When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3(a) or 3(b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">" 


Rule 3 only becomes applicable if the headings in the Chapters or the Notes to those headings do not otherwise require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">In fact, as I have indicated, the Notes to Ch 29 provide that the Chapter is confined to goods or products that consist exclusively of chemical compounds, unless some special exception applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">As no such exception applies, the occasion did not arise for r 3(b) to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">58 Accordingly, I consider that the Tribunal erred in law in classifying each of the products under sub-heading 2905.29.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">HEADING 3824 
 
59 Before the Tribunal, Customs argued that if heading 3808 was inapplicable, then the products should alternatively be classified under heading 3824.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The Tribunal held that heading 3824 was inapplicable because it was restricted to products that were wholly chemical; it could not apply to the products in question because they contained wire and plastic tubes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">60 Strictly speaking, given the conclusion I have reached that the products are properly classifiable under sub-heading 3808.10.90, the applicability of heading 3824 does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">However, I should indicate that in my opinion the conclusion reached by the Tribunal was wrong in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Heading 3824 applies, inter alia , to chemical products and preparations of the chemical or allied industries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">If heading 3808 were inapplicable, there would be no reason for excluding the relevant products from classification under heading 3824.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">On the evidence, they were clearly chemical products or at the very least preparations of chemical or allied industries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The products are not excluded from classification as chemical products or preparations of chemical or allied industries under heading 3824 on the ground that they are not wholly chemical and consist of wire and plastic dispensers that contain a chemical dosage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">CONCLUSION 
 
61 I have reached the conclusion that the classification adopted by the Tribunal was erroneous as a matter of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The correct classification of the products is under sub-heading 3808.10.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">62 In the circumstances, I propose to make orders in accordance with the minutes of consent orders that were submitted to me by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I certify that the preceding sixty-two (62) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>
