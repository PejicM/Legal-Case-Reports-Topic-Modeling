1 This is an appeal from an interlocutory judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 22 March 2007 dismissing an application for an extension of time pursuant to s 477(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') for the filing of an application pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Part 8 Div 2 of the Act for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 4 September 2006 handed down 26 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the delegate') to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('the PRC') who arrived in Australia on 25 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 10 April 2006 the appellant lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa with the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (now the Department of Immigration and Citizenship).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 15 May 2006 the delegate refused the application for a protection visa and notified the appellant of the decision and his review rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 19 June 2006 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">CLAIMS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 
 
3 In his application for a protection visa, the appellant claimed to fear persecution because he is a Falun Gong practitioner in the PRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This fear was the result, he said, of being detained and mistreated by police who also made threats of life imprisonment if he did not desist his practice of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was because of these events that he came to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
4 On 20 June 2006 the Tribunal sent the appellant a letter by post, acknowledging receipt of his application on 19 June 2006 and providing information as to the future disposition of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 On 28 June 2006, the Tribunal sent the appellant a letter by post, stating that the Tribunal had considered the material before it in relation to the appellant's application, but was unable to make a decision in favour of the appellant on this information alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant, pursuant to s 425 of the Act, was invited to attend a Tribunal hearing on 23 August 2006, to give evidence and to present arguments in support of his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He was also invited to send any new documents or written arguments which he wanted the Tribunal to consider and to complete the "Witnesses" part of the 'Response to Hearing Invitation' form if he wanted the Tribunal to get oral evidence from another person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He was requested to return the completed form, with any new documents or written arguments, by 14 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The appellant did not reply to the letter of 28 June 2006 and did not attend the hearing on 23 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 After the close of business on 24 August 2006, the appellant faxed a letter to the Tribunal indicating that he had been unable to attend the scheduled Tribunal hearing because of illness and that he had been sick for over a week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant indicated that he wished to have another hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">A medical certificate which was dated 23 August 2006 from Pacific Medical Centre Blacktown was provided, indicating that the appellant was 'unable to attend work/school' from 23 August 2006 to 24 August 2006 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">There was no list of doctors on the letterhead and the signature was illegible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 On 25 August 2006 the Tribunal wrote to the Pacific Medical Centre in Blacktown, from where the medical certificate was issued, asking for details regarding the issue of the medical certificate and for details about the patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Its contents reveal that the Tribunal was concerned to satisfy itself that the medical certificate was genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal outlined as follows :
 
 'Please find attached a fax which was received late yesterday afternoon at the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal receives a number of medical certificates and, unfortunately, not all prove to be genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 The attached certificate does not indicate which doctor attended to the patient: the signature is incomprehensible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Court you please provide further details in response to the Member's concerns listed below, or at least the name of the doctor and a time when it may be convenient for the Member to speak to him or her directly by telephone?</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 The person who sent this medical certificate noted in a covering letter that he has been ill for one week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The medical certificate has indicated two days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 The person listed as the patient is known to us as living in Ashfield, yet the medical practice is at Blacktown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Is this the patient's usual medical practitioner?</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">If the patient was able to travel to Blacktown to see the doctor, is there any reason why he could not have travelled a much shorter distance to the city in order to keep an appointment with the Tribunal?</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 Can the doctor indicate at what time of day the appointment was?</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">' 
 

9 A file note dated 29 August 2006 indicated that in response to the Tribunal's requests, the receptionist of the Pacific Medical Centre rang immediately (on 25 August 2006) and stated that the Medical Centre was not entitled to provide information about patients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal requested that the receptionist provide the name of the doctor who issued the medical certificate, a suitable time to contact and that the receptionist fax written comments to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The receptionist indicated that she would send written information but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">10 On 29 August 2006 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant informing him that it had decided not to offer him a further hearing and advising him that it had also decided to exercise its powers under s 426A of the Act namely to make a decision on his case without taking further action to allow or enable him to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The letter contained the following: 
 
 'The Tribunal member has considered your request for another hearing and has, on reflection, decided against offering one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 The Tribunal notes that you were originally offered a hearing by letter dated 28 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The letter noted in a highlighted box: "If you do not attend the hearing, and the Tribunal does not postpone the hearing, it can make a decision on your case without further notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" 
 
 The hearing was scheduled for 23 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The letter about the hearing requested that you reply, stating your intention of attending or not attending, by 14 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The letter also invited you to send any new arguments or any new documents you wanted the Tribunal to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">You did not reply by the given date; nor make any contact with the Tribunal whatever in the subsequent five weeks to the time of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 Your first contact with the Tribunal was a fax sent after office hours on 24 August 2006, the day after your scheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In this fax, you note that you have been ill for over a week and "hope to another hearing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Member refers again to the instructions in the letter containing the offer of hearing: "If you think you may not be able to attend the hearing, you must contact the Tribunal immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">" If you were ill for over a week prior to 24 August 2006, you had ample opportunity to contact the Tribunal and postpone the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, the Member notes that you did not go to the doctor until the actual day of the hearing: 23 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Member notes that the doctor stated that you were ill only for two days --- the day of the hearing and the following one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The diagnosis --- "viral illness" --- could cover a range of disorders including a common cold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 The Member also notes that despite the fact that you live in Ashfield, you travelled all the way to Blacktown in order to attend a medical practice there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Member notes that it would have been a much shorter and less arduous trip to go from Ashfield to the city and attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 
 In considering all the circumstances, the Member has decided to exercise her power under s 426A of the Act and make a decision on your case without taking further action to allow or enable you to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">' 
 

11 As it said, in the letter, that it would, the Tribunal then proceeded to make a decision without granting the appellant a further opportunity to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Tribunal's reasons relevantly, were as follows: 
 
 'The applicant was put on notice by the Tribunal that it was unable to make a favourable decision on the material available to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">He did not send further material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The applicant was put on notice in writing that the Tribunal could make a decision on his case with no further notice if it did not reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">He did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">He did not contact the Tribunal to say that he would attend a hearing and provide oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He was notified in late June 2006 about a hearing that would take place in over seven weeks time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He had ample opportunity to contact the Tribunal if he intended to come to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">However, he did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Sometime on the day or the evening of the hearing (23 August 2006), the applicant apparently travelled from Ashfield (the address he gave the Tribunal) all the way to Blacktown --- a significant journey --- in order to go to a medical practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It would have been less arduous for the applicant, if he were not feeling well, to travel from Ashfield to the city and attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">If the applicant had been demonstrably not well at the hearing, the Tribunal would have adjourned to another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">However, the applicant travelled to Blacktown where a doctor noted that he was unwell on that particular day and the next.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The applicant, on the other hand, said in his fax to the Tribunal that he had been ill for over a week as of 24 August 2006 --- that is, since before 17 August.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">This would have given him ample time to let the Tribunal know he was unable to attend a hearing, as he was requested to do in the original offer hearing letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 The Tribunal has an obligation to provide a mechanism of review which is "fair, just, economical, informal and quick".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Recent legislation has obliged the Tribunal to complete a case within 90 days of receiving it, unless there is a cogent reason why this cannot be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">If the Tribunal were to offer the applicant another hearing, it would not be possible to schedule this until well into October - some two months after it was originally set down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This would extend the decision-making process well beyond the prescribed 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Given the way he has failed to respond to invitations in the past, there is no reason to believe that he would come to a later-scheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He has not indicated that he has any new document or arguments he wants the Tribunal to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 In the Tribunal's experience, people who believe that they have genuine claims for a protection visa are anxious to come to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">If they are taken ill, they contact the Tribunal immediately, and are able to supply satisfactory medical certificates setting out exactly why they are [sic] could not attend at the scheduled time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">If they have other problems, they ring the contact person listed on the Tribunal correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 In the case of this applicant, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant has ever had a genuine intention of coming to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He has had ample opportunity to make known his intentions to come to a hearing and has failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In this case, the Tribunal stands by its advice to the applicant in its letter of 28 June 2006: that it is unable to make a decision in his favour on the basis of the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Tribunal at the time of writing has only the same material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This material lacks detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is no evidence before the Tribunal to indicate that the applicant has any knowledge of the practice of Falun Gong, nor its history or philosophy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He notes that it is deemed to be a "cult" and seems to indicate that the Government viewed it unfavourably after 1999, but this is common knowledge and does not indicate any specialized knowledge available to a practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the applicant has undertaken any Falun Gong practice or associated activities in Australia, which one would expect from a practitioner who was genuinely seeking a non-repressive place in which to practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">' 
 
 

12 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">However, it is to be remembered that the decision was made without the benefit of further material and submissions, which may have been presented by the appellant at a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
13 The application before the Federal Magistrate was to extend time, pursuant to s 477(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act "), for the filing of an application pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Part 8 Division 2 of the Act for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 4 September 2006 and handed down on 26 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">14 The applicant was notified of the decision of the Tribunal on 5 October 2006 but did not file his application for judicial review of that decision as well as for an extension of time pursuant to s 477 of the Act until 8 November 2006 which was several days outside the 28 day period provided for in s 477(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">However s 477(2) of the Act allows the Court to extend that 28 day period by up to 56 days if: 
 
 
 (a) an application for that order is made within 84 days of the actual (as opposed to deemed) notification of the decision; and 
 (b) the Federal Magistrate is satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 

15 The application for an order to extend time was made within 84 days of 5 October 2006 and accordingly, the Court below was empowered to extend time subject only to it being satisfied that it was in the interests of the administration of justice to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">16 In an amended application the appellant raised two proposed grounds of review as follows:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The RRT failed to attain, or failed to exercise, jurisdiction, by reason that the RRT erred in law in finding that it could not reschedule a hearing of the RRT beyond the period set out in s 414A unless it had "cogent reasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 
 
 Particulars: 
 Decision Record CB 69.2 
 S 414A Migration Act 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The RRT failed to attain, or failed to exercise, jurisdiction, by reasons that the RRT erred in law in taking into account irrelevant considerations in finding that the RRT would not reschedule a hearing of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 
 
 Particulars: 
 Decision Record (CB 69.2) 
 
 
 
 "given the way he has failed to respond to invitations in the past, there is no reason to believe that he would come to a later-scheduled hearing"

 "he has not indicated that he has any new documents or argument he wants the Tribunal to consider"

 "in the Tribunal's experience, people who believe that they have genuine claims for a protection visa are anxious to come to hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">If they are taken ill, they contact the Tribunal immediately......</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Tribunal correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">" 
 
 
 
 THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
17 The Federal Magistrate considered the merits of the proposed grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In respect to the first proposed ground, her Honour concluded that fairly read, the Tribunal, when it stated that it could not reschedule a hearing beyond the 90 day period, set out under s 414A(1) of the Act , unless there were "cogent reasons" was not really seeking to introduce a discretionary criterion to this statutory provision where none is expressly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Rather, as her Honour implicitly found, this discretion arose pursuant to s 426A of the Act which confers upon the Tribunal a discretion, where the applicant does not appear before the Tribunal at the scheduled hearing, whether or not to enable the applicant to appear before it at a rescheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It was not suggested by the appellant before her Honour that such a discretion was not thereby open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">18 Her Honour found that it was perfectly proper for the Tribunal to take into account that its own timetable would not allow it to reschedule the hearing until a date beyond the 90 day period, as well as taking into account the failure of the appellant to respond to the Tribunal's letters of 28 June or 29 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">19 As to the second proposed ground, the Federal Magistrate concluded that the matters taken into account by the Tribunal were, in effect, relevant and open and that no error was disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">20 Whilst the medical certificate was mentioned in the Federal Magistrate's reasons at [15], [18]-[20], her Honour did not, it seems, consider the effect of the certificate and its relevance to the appellant's request for a rescheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">21 The Federal Magistrate concluded that the Tribunal had complied with its statutory obligations, both in the conduct of its review and in the making of its decision, which was not affected by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">22 Having found that the proposed grounds had no reasonable prospect of success her Honour determined that it was not in the interest of justice that time be extended to the appellant to file his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Federal Magistrate accordingly dismissed the application for an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 
23 The Notice of Appeal filed by the appellant on 12 April 2007 contains two grounds of review:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Her Honour erred in holding ([39]) that: 
 
 
 
 "...it is a matter for the Tribunal the considerations to which it has regard in the exercise of its discretion" 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Her Honour erred in holding ([39]) that: 
 
 
 
 "Each were matters open to the Tribunal to consider in the exercise of its discretion and there is no error going to the Tribunal's jurisdiction established by the Tribunal's regard to those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">" 
 
 
 

24 The appeal in substance is a broad challenge to the manner of exercise of its discretion by the Tribunal and the failure by the Court below in turn, to find relevant error going to that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">25 The first respondent contends that the appellant has failed to establish that the discretionary decision below is plainly wrong and, in turn, that the test for leave enunciated in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 has not been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">26 The first respondent accepts, in effect, that where the relevant delay is short and there is no prejudice to the first respondent, an extension would normally be granted but, because it would be futile to do so, there being no merit in the proposed appeal, leave ought be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This is to reiterate the opinion of the Federal Magistrate that the application lacked utility because substantively there were no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">27 It is said by the first respondent that the grounds in the notice of appeal reproduce what was ground two before her Honour, and that no plain error is manifest in her Honour's reasoning or conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">28 The first respondent also submits that, having regard to the construction placed upon s 426A by Greenwood J in NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 , where the matters set out under s 426A(1)(a) and (b) are satisfied, the Tribunal's discretion whether to make a decision without a further hearing is constrained only by the requirement that it not act capriciously and that in this case the Tribunal did not so act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">REASONS 
 
29 In my opinion, s 426A of the Act confers a discretion upon the Tribunal to exercise its statutory power in one of two ways assuming the conditions in s 426A(1)(a) and (b) are first met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Firstly, the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable an applicant to appear before it [s 426(1)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Secondly it may reschedule an applicant's appearance before it, or delay its decision on the review in order to enable the applicant's appearance before it as rescheduled [s 426(2)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">30 In this case the Tribunal exercised its discretion under s 426(1) and made its decision without taking any further action to allow or enable the appellant to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In SZHSQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1295 at [57] Rares J said: 
 
 'The seriousness of the possibility that a consequence of a decision to proceed to affirm a decision under s 426A(1) that the persecution feared could be suffered is in my opinion part of the subject matter, scope and purpose of the legislation and conditions the way in which the discretion in s 426A(1) falls to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">' 
 

I respectfully agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">31 There are related questions as to whether the discretion miscarried because the Tribunal misdirected itself: NBGZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 119 at [52] - [56] per Allsop J, or failed to consider relevant material: NBBL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 at [21] and [24], the result of which was that the appellant was denied procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">32 The Tribunal is not required, where there is compliance with ss 425 and 425A of the Act , to make further enquiries, if the applicant fails to attend the review hearing: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC [2006] FCAFC 73 [38]-[39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Nor is it required to give reasons for its exercise of discretion under s 426A: SZHSQ at [60].</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Further, this is not one of those cases where there was requisite compliance by the Tribunal with ss 425 and 425A but the appellant did not, in fact, receive the letter of invitation to attend the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">See VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 at [16] ; NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 at [16] ; NASF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 162 at [16] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Nor is it a case where the appellant's non-appearance was the result of the negligence of a migration agent: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 at [127] per French J, cited with approval by the High Court in SZFDE at [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">33 In SZIGQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 328 , Downes J at [5] reiterated that the authorities are clear that the reason for non-attendance at a hearing does not matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">If there is compliance with ss 425 and 425A , the Tribunal may proceed under s 426A to consider and decide the matter without conducting any further enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I do not take his Honour to be saying that where the Tribunal is in fact appraised of the reason for non-attendance at a scheduled hearing by an applicant for review that due consideration should not be given to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">34 Nonetheless, where, as in this case, the discretion is unconfined, the Tribunal may have regard to a range of factors in the exercise of its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">That range too is unconfined except in so far as the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute by implication limit those factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard: SZHSQ at [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">See also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; (1996) 162 CLR 24 at 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">35 I do not accept the submission of the first respondent that the only constraint upon the exercise of the discretion is that it not be exercised capriciously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">NBBL as I mentioned was said to be authority for this proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">A proper reading of Greenwood J's reasons however shows that his Honour referred to a capricious decision as but one example of a circumstance which might give rise to procedural unfairness [24].</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">At [21] of his Honour's reasons, a wider foundation is apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">36 In this case the Tribunal elected to make enquiries and to give reasons for the exercise of its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It did not make its decision on the day scheduled for the hearing but delayed its decision, it seems in effect, to consider whether, under s 426A(2) of the Act , it would reschedule the hearing in order to enable the appellant's appearance before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In my opinion it is relevant then to consider whether, arguably, it took irrelevant matters into account and/or failed to take relevant matters into account in exercising its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">37 The matters which, according to its reasons, the Tribunal took into account, in exercising its discretion, probably, it seems, on 29 August 2006 (in any event after receipt of the appellant's fax of 24 August 2006), under s 426A(1) , not to enable the applicant to appear before it, were as follows: 
 
 &#8226; The applicant was put on notice by the Tribunal (pursuant to s 425 of the Act ) that it was unable to make a favourable decision on the material available to it but he did not send further material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">He was also put on notice that the Tribunal could make a decision on his case with no further notice if he did not reply and he did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He did not contact the Tribunal to say that he would attend a hearing and provide oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">He did not indicate that he had any new documents or arguments he wanted the Tribunal to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">He was notified in late June 2006 about a hearing that would take place in over seven weeks time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He had ample opportunity to contact the Tribunal if he intended to come to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However he did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">


 
 &#8226; Further, sometime on the day or the evening of the hearing (23 October 2006) the applicant apparently travelled from Ashfield, the address which he had given to the Tribunal, all the way to Blacktown --- a significant journey --- in order to go to a medical practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It would have been less arduous for the applicant, if he were not feeling well, to travel from Ashfield to the city and attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">If the applicant had been demonstrably not well at the hearing, the Tribunal would have adjourned to another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">A doctor noted that he was unwell on the day of the hearing and the next.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicant on the other hand had said in his fax to the Tribunal that he had been ill for over a week as of 24 August 2006 --- that is, since before 17 August.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">This would have given him ample time to let the Tribunal know he was unable to attend a hearing, as he was requested to do in the original offer of hearing letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">


 
 &#8226; If the Tribunal were to have offered the applicant another hearing it would not have been possible to have scheduled this until well into October --- some 2 months after it was originally set down which would have extended the decision-making process well beyond the 90 days prescribed under s 414A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">


 
 &#8226; In the Tribunal's experience people who believe that they have genuine claims for a protection visa are anxious to come to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">If they are taken ill, they contact the Tribunal immediately, and are able to supply satisfactory medical certificates setting out exactly why they could not attend at the scheduled time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">If they have other problems they ring the contact person listed on the Tribunal correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">


 
 &#8226; The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had ever had a genuine intention of coming to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">He had had ample opportunity to make known his intentions to come to a hearing and had failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">


I will deal with these matters in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Appellant's Failure to notify Tribunal prior to hearing that he was unable to attend 
 
38 The invitation to appear letter of 28 June 2006 was sent by the Tribunal pursuant to its obligations under s 425 of the Act which is in terms that:
 
 '425(1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">' 
 

39 None of the exceptions to this statutory obligation which are set out under s 425A(2) apply in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">40 There is no obligation whatsoever upon an applicant for review to respond to such a letter of invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It is no more than an invitation to appear to give evidence and present arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The letter also asked the applicant to read and complete the "Response to Hearing Invitation" form carefully and to: 
 
 &#8226; tell us if you are coming to the hearing or not; 
 &#8226; complete the "Witnesses" part of the form if you want the Tribunal to get oral evidence from another person; please note the Tribunal does not have to get evidence from any person you name; 
 &#8226; send us any new documents or written arguments you want the Tribunal to consider; 
 &#8226; please note any documents or arguments you send should be in English or translated by a qualified translator; 
 &#8226; answer all the other questions on the form and return the completed form and any new documents or written arguments by 14 July 2006 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">

41 Whilst there are plainly very practical reasons for making such requests of the applicant, he was under no legal obligation to comply with those requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Section 425(1) is clear in its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The invitation to the applicant is "to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review".</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It contemplates that such evidence, oral or documentary or both, which of course might well go beyond the content of the written application for the protection visa, will be given, and any arguments will be presented, at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">I consider it irrelevant to the exercise of discretion that the applicant did not reply to this letter prior to the scheduled date of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Furthermore, the Tribunal's reasons state that the applicant was put on notice that the Tribunal could make a decision on his case with no further notice if he did not reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">This was erroneous both as to the content of the notice and indeed the terms of the statutory discretion under s 426A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The notice of 28 June 2006 in fact informed the applicant that if he did " not attend the hearing and the Tribunal does not postpone the hearing , it can make a decision on your case without further notice ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">This broadly reflects the language of s 426A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">42 Accordingly, in my opinion, it was arguable that it was an irrelevant consideration to the exercise of discretion that the applicant did not either respond to the Tribunal's correspondence or to advise it that he intended coming to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Attendance at Doctor in Blacktown 
 
43 The Tribunal also placed some weight on the proposition that it would have been, in its opinion, less arduous for the applicant, if he were not feeling well, to have travelled from Ashfield to the city and to have attended the hearing rather than to travel a greater distance to Blacktown in order to see a doctor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">There might however be several explanations for such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The applicant may not have had his own local doctor and attended the doctor in Blacktown on the recommendation of a friend or relative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He may even have been taken by a vehicle driven by someone else such as that friend or relative to see that particular doctor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">That is but one possible explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Reliance was also placed, it seems, by the Tribunal upon the apparent conflict between what the applicant said to the Tribunal as to the length of time he had been ill namely, "for over a week" as contained in his fax and the dates 23 and 24 August 2006 noted on the medical certificate from the Pacific Medical Centre, Blacktown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">However there is at least one possible explanation which on its face is capable of reconciling this apparent conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In his fax the applicant said that he had been "sick" for over a week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The medical certificate on the other hand contains a pre-typed opinion "is unable to attend work/school".</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The box which is alongside this has been ticked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">It is prefatory to the dates "from 23/8/06 to 24/8/06 inclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It may well be that whilst the applicant was sick for several days prior to 23 August 2006 that it did not incapacitate him from attending work, assuming he were employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Another explanation is that the doctor may not have been prepared to grant him a certificate for any prior dates because he did not see him before 23 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">44 The fact is, however, that on its face, this is a medical certificate by a doctor, to the effect that the appellant was unable to attend the Tribunal (although it refers to "work/school") due to a viral illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The certificate is dated 23 August 2006 and is signed although the signature is not legible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It is plain that the Tribunal considered that the medical certificate might not be genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In its letter of 25 August 2006 to the Pacific Medical Centre a Tribunal officer stated that the Tribunal "receives a number of medical certificates and unfortunately not all prove to be genuine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It sought clarification from the medical centre but ultimately the medical centre staff declined to provide any information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">That is understandable enough given the relationship of confidentiality existing between a doctor and patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">In any event this refusal to provide the information requested can hardly be sheeted home to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">45 It should be noted that the Tribunal did not actually make a finding that the medical certificate was not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">However, it is not, in my opinion, arguably, relevant to the exercise of discretion for the Tribunal to have concluded that, had the applicant attended at the Tribunal hearing on 23 August 2006 instead of going to the medical practice, then if it were persuaded that he was demonstrably not well at the hearing then it would have adjourned to another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Whilst that may be so, the fact remains that the medical certificate was provided to the Tribunal albeit on the day after the date scheduled for the hearing to the effect that the applicant was unable to attend the previous day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Moreover, in my opinion, arguably, the Tribunal afforded undue weight to the fact that the appellant had been ill since before 17 August 2006 and which led it to conclude that he would have had ample time to let the Tribunal know that he was unable to attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">It may be that whilst he was ill prior to 23 August 2006 that he was not so unwell such as to cause him to conclude that he would not be able to attend the hearing on 23 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">However on 23 August the position may well have altered significantly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It is to be remembered also that the applicant does not speak English and may not have been in a position to communicate by telephone to the Tribunal or registry staff on 23 August 2006 that he was too unwell to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Impossibility of Providing Further Hearing Within Prescribed 90 Day Period 
 
46 Section 414A of the Act is in the following terms: 
 
 ' (1) If an application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision: 
 
 (a) was validly made under section 412 ; or 
 
 
 
 (b) was remitted by any court to the Refugee Review Tribunal for reconsideration; 
 
 
 
 then the Refugee Review Tribunal must review the decision under section 414 and record its decision under section 430 within 90 days starting on the day on which the Secretary gave the Registrar the documents that subsection 418(2) requires the Secretary to give to the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 (2) Failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of a decision made under section 415 on an application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">' 


 
47 This matter which was taken into account by the Tribunal is not to be considered in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The Tribunal's reasons, after referring to the prescribed 90 days, state: 
 
 ' Given the way he has failed to respond to invitations in the past, there is no reason to believe that he would come to a later-scheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">He has not indicated that he has any new document or arguments he wants the Tribunal to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">' 
 

48 It seems to me that it was these matters which together with the other matters referred to, caused the Tribunal to consider that rescheduling the hearing would in effect be a waste of time, should no new documents or arguments be proffered to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I have already indicated that the appellant was under no obligation to do either of those things, even though he was requested to do so in the letter of 28 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Section 425 contemplates that these matters would be produced to the Tribunal, if at all, at the scheduled hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">49 Accepting the Tribunal's obligation to review the decision under s 414 and record its decision under s 430 within 90 days from the day on which the Secretary gave the Registrar the documents required by subsection 418(2) to be given by the Secretary to the Registrar, I would be most surprised, if the Tribunal had been persuaded to exercise its discretion to enable the applicant to appear before it, if a suitable date was in the 90 day period could not have been found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Indeed, a Tribunal officer wrote to the appellant by letter dated 29 August 2006 advising him that his request for another hearing had on reflection not been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In the penultimate paragraph, the letter advised the appellant that if he had any questions he should call the Tribunal officer on the number set out in the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It did not suggest that if he did so and provided new information, that the Tribunal could and might recall its decision and consider that new information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">However in its reasons the Tribunal said that if the appellant had done so, then the decision would have been recalled and the new information considered as was normal Tribunal practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I infer from that that it considered itself in a position to consider new information before the expiry of the 90 day period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">50 In my opinion, this matter in those circumstances was arguably irrelevant to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The Tribunal's Experience with other Applicants 
 
51 I am prepared to assume that the Tribunal's experience with other applicants may be relevant to its consideration as to the exercise of its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">However, for my part, I would afford, in this case, such considerations little if any weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">According to the Tribunal's reasons, people who believe that they have genuine claims for a protection visa are anxious to come to a hearing and if they are taken ill, contact the Tribunal immediately and are able to supply satisfactory medical certificates setting out exactly why they could not attend at the schedule time or if they have other problems, they ring the contact person listed on the Tribunal correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Putting it another way, the Tribunal seems to have concluded that because, in its opinion, the medical certificate was unsatisfactory, the appellant could not have believed that he had a genuine claim for a protection visa and was not anxious to come to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In any event, on its face, the medical certificate is, in my opinion, satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">It states exactly why the applicant could not attend, in effect, the Tribunal hearing on 23 August 2006 because he had a viral illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It was not for the Tribunal to speculate as to the seriousness or otherwise of that diagnosis which it clearly did when, for example, in the letter to which I have already referred from the Tribunal to the appellant dated 29 August 2006 the Tribunal officer said that the "diagnosis --- 'viral illness' --- could cover a range of disorders including a common cold".</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">52 In my opinion, arguably, this matter was not relevant to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion, or, arguably, if relevant, should have been accorded little or no weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">No Genuine Intention by Appellant to Attend Hearing 
 
53 This consideration turns on the Tribunal's view that the appellant had ample opportunity to make known his intentions as to coming to the hearing but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">I have already dealt with that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It follows that in my opinion, arguably, this was an irrelevant consideration to the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The Effect of the Medical Certificate 
 
54 Most importantly, in my opinion, arguably, the Tribunal in a material sense disregarded the medical certificate dated 23 August 2006 to the effect that the appellant was unable to attend the schedule hearing on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">It seems to have accepted that the appellant did travel to Blacktown and that a doctor did note on the certificate that he was unwell on that particular day and the next.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">In fact that is not what the doctor certified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">He certified that due to viral illness he would be unable to attend, in effect, the Tribunal hearing, on the 23 or 24 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">However the use made by the Tribunal of the certificate was to highlight what it clearly considered to be a discrepancy as to the length of the period of illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The Tribunal should have, in my opinion, accepted that the evidence before it, namely the medical certificate, was to the effect that he was not able to attend the scheduled hearing by reason that he was unfit to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In so doing, in my opinion, it acted unreasonably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The Tribunal, in its reasons, stated that, had the appellant appeared before it, and had it concluded that the appellant was demonstrably not well, then it would have adjourned the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">That of course, had it occurred, would have been reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">However, the medical certificate was to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">55 The appellant, relying upon the medical certificate, had sought an adjournment in order that he might at a later date take up the critically important invitation to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">A refusal of an application for an adjournment for this reason may amount to procedural unfairness: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [40] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 at [31] - [39] ; Applicant S296 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1166 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Such, arguably, was the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">56 In this case, the Tribunal had before it a medical certificate which was on its face genuine and sufficient to establish a good reason for the appellant's non-attendance before it on the day scheduled for the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">57 The Federal Magistrate, as I indicated above, did not in her reasons consider the effect of the medical certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In my respectful opinion, this was arguably a relevant consideration and it was an error to ignore it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Likewise, again arguably, the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal had not fallen into error when directing itself otherwise, as to the exercise of its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">58 It follows, in my opinion, that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended with sufficient doubt such as to warrant its consideration by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">I am also satisfied, assuming the decision below to be wrong, that a substantial injustice would result if leave were refused: D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">59 In so concluding, I am satisfied that the decision of the Federal Magistrate to not extend time did not amount to a proper exercise of discretion: House v King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">In arriving at her conclusion, her Honour was of the view that the proposed appeal had no reasonable prospects of success and that for that reason it was not in the interests of justice that time be extended [46].</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">I have indicated that in my opinion the appellant's grounds are arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">By that I mean, for present purposes, that they have reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">For that reason it would be in the interests of the administration of justice that time be extended pursuant to s 477(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">60 I would accordingly grant leave to appeal and would allow the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">There should be an order extending time for making the application for review to 8 November 2006 being the date when the appellant filed his application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Associate:
