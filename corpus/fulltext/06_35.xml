 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 22 September 2005 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 11 April 2005 the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Minister") refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Background 
 
2 The appellant is a national of Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He was detained on 8 February 2005 after having lived and worked illegally in Australia since the expiry of his 6 week visitor's visa in November 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">After being detained, he lodged two protection visa applications with the Department of Immigration ("The Department") within a week, claiming to fear persecution for different reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">First, because he was a Hindu who had married a Christian and then because he had married a woman of a lower caste.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal's decision 
 
3 After the Tribunal hearing the appellant in these proceedings raised a new claim that he was persecuted because he was Christian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Tribunal rejected the new claim, found the appellant was entitled to live in India and that his substantive claims were unreliable and not Convention related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In considering the appellant's subjective fear, the Tribunal took into account the appellant's delay in bringing his protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Federal Magistrate's judgment 
 
4 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal failed to inform him in writing of the information that there was no record of an earlier protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Federal Magistrate found there was no breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("The Act") and that the Tribunal was entitled to reject the new claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">His Honour found that the Tribunal's decision ultimately turned on the lack of Convention nexus with the harm feared, rather than a right to live in another Country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appeal and its disposition 
 
5 The three grounds pursued in the appeal were that:
 
 
 (i) The Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A in that it did not provide the appellant with particulars in writing of certain information which forms part of the Tribunal's reasons for affirming the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The information was said to be "... the apparent absence of any confirmation in the Departmental records before it of the appellant's claim to have previously lodged an application for recognition as a refugee many years earlier".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">(ii) The Tribunal erred in law in ascertaining whether any persecution the appellant may have suffered and might suffer was for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">(iii) The Tribunal erred in law in its application of s 36(3) in relation to the appellant's right to enter and reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 

All of the above matters were said to manifest jurisdictional error and it was argued that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to make findings to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The first ground was based on the premise that the Tribunal had information it was obliged to give in accordance with s 424A of the Act The Tribunal was said to have gained this "information" from examining the Departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In effect, the "information" was the absence in the file of any record of an earlier protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 The Tribunal recorded in its reasons for decision that it had before it the appellant's Departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It did not, at that point in its reasons, say it had read the file, although it did say it "had regard to the material referred to in the delegate's decision, and other material available to it from a range of sources".</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Later in its reasons, the Tribunal said that it had "before it no evidence of that application [for what appears to be a residence under skills visa] or any protection visa application that could have preceded it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal's reference to not having before it any evidence of an earlier visa application may be a reference to what the Tribunal had gleaned from an examination of the Departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">However, it may also be a reference to material (or the absence of material) furnished by the appellant in support of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Indeed the solicitor representing the appellant conceded before the Tribunal that material concerning the earlier protection visa was on the Departmental file, which suggests that the Tribunal's reference to there being "no evidence" was not based on an examination of the file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It is more likely that the Tribunal was referring to an absence of material furnished by the appellant to support his claim that he had made an earlier application which had not been pursued to decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The premise is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 The second ground does not appear to me to be one of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The gist of the appellant's claim was that he incurred the wrath of his uncle for not marrying his uncle's daughter and for marrying a Christian not of the same class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That claim does not point to his religion as being a basis for any harm, on his account of what had happened in the past and might happen in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The conclusion of the Tribunal that any persecution the appellant might suffer was not "Convention related" does not involve, in my opinion, any misunderstanding or misapplication of the applicable law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">9 As to the third matter, it was submitted that the Tribunal misconstrued the Treaty between India and Nepal which, it was argued, did not entitle the appellant, a Nepalese citizen, to reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Reliance was placed on the observations of Lee J in WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 at 278, which might be viewed as indicating that it is necessary for there to be a prior acceptance or acknowledgement by a third country to enliven s 36(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The short answer to this argument is that it was not part of the appellant's case that he could not enter and reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">To the contrary, he indicated in his application for a protection visa that he could enter or reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">This proposition was repeated at the Tribunal at hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">While it appears his position on this issue wavered at the hearing, in a written submission made after the hearing, it was not suggested that he could not enter and reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Even if the Tribunal erred in construing the treaty (probably a question of fact in any event), it was open to it to make the finding it did, namely that the appellant could enter and reside in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">10 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Associate:
