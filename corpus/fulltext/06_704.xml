1 This is an application for leave to appeal against interlocutory orders made in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The effect of those orders was to decline to set aside earlier orders of that Court which had dismissed an application for non-appearance pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) as they stood in September 2005 ( NBBM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 51).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The reasons for judgment indicate that the learned Federal Magistrate firstly considered the applicant's explanation for the earlier non-appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It was concluded that the Court had given appropriate notice of the hearing to the applicant at the address which he had provided by way of notice of change of address for service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The learned Federal Magistrate appears to me to have approached the matter in a perfectly conventional manner and found that there was no sufficient explanation for non-attendance in view of the fact that the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) had been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Indeed, it is suggested that there was no real explanation provided at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I can see no possibility of appealable error being shown in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant before me simply says that the person at that address did not pass the document on to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That does not establish appealable error in the court below on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 The learned Federal Magistrate pointed out that if there had been a sufficient explanation it would also have been necessary to decide whether the applicant raised a serious question to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">No such basis was found in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 Before me, the applicant refers in a roundabout way to noncompliance with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which of course has been a very fashionable point to raise following certain authorities of the High Court and of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He concedes those matters were not raised in the application to the Magistrates Court, and indeed has not been raised in any of the documents which have been filed in the application before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He does not descend to any detail as to how the point might apply, but merely makes a formulaic oral submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Thus, there does not appear to have been any basis upon which the learned Federal Magistrate could have found that there was an arguable case to be tried, if it was necessary to reach such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 However, the major difficulty with the application is that there is no proper explanation for the applicant's original non-appearance before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Rules of Court are there for a particular purpose and the learned Federal Magistrate was entitled to come to the view he came to in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I therefore dismiss the application for leave and order that the applicant pay the costs of the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Associate:
