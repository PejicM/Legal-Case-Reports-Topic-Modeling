<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 8 April 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) of 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship who formed the view that the appellant is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 , amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 (Convention) and accordingly refused to grant a protection visa on 10 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">CLAIMS MADE TO REFUGEE STATUS 
 Article 1A(2) of the Convention relevantly defines a refugee as any person who: 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it 
 The appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 14 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 26 October 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 10 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 10 January 2008, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed to fear persecution in China due to her practice of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">She claimed that she began practising Falun Gong in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In December 2004 she was arrested and detained until October 2005 after attending a demonstration against the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">She was beaten and tortured in gaol because she would not denounce Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She was forced to pledge that she would not practise Falun Gong in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">She claimed that she bribed officials to obtain a passport and visa before coming to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner who had practised Falun Gong in China or Australia, as it did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal found that the appellant's knowledge of Falun Gong was not commensurate with the period of time she claimed to have practised Falun Gong as well as inconsistencies both in her evidence to the Tribunal and between the evidence given to the Tribunal and her original protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal also noted that her evidence that she lived at the same address after being released from detention and left China on a passport in her own name was inconsistent with her claims to fear persecution and to be of adverse interest to the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Tribunal consequently rejected all of the appellant's claims, stating that there was no plausible evidence before it that enabled it to conclude that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner and would suffer any persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">These above findings were based on the following: The Tribunal therefore affirmed the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 The application for judicial review filed in the Court below contained five grounds of review, which read as follows: There was no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The decision involved an important exercise of the power conferred by the Migration Act and Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal member ... not constitute the Refugee Review Tribunal in any further hearing or consideration of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I really fear the persecution from my original country, PR China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The persecution is for the reason of a member of a particular group-Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I was arrested and sent to jail just because I am a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Federal Magistrate found no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal, for the reasons explained below and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 On 28 April 2009, the appellant filed in this Court a notice of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate, in which it is claimed that: There was no evidence or the other materials to justify the making of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal decision took the following irrelevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power: The general country information without consideration of the facts of my case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal is required by s 424A of the Act of the Migration Act 1958 to give the applicant notice of the particulars of the information and the reason why the Tribunal considered it relevant to the case, the Tribunal failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">GROUND 1: THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OR THE OTHER MATERIALS TO JUSTIFY THE MAKING OF THE DECISION.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 The appellant raised this complaint before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Her Honour noted that, in this case, the Tribunal's decision was based on its appraisal of the appellant's claims having regard to the visitor visa application, the protection visa application and her oral evidence to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">For the reasons it gave, the Tribunal found that the appellant was lacking credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Her Honour found that the appellant was unable to establish that the Tribunal's assessment of this evidence was not open to it for the reasons it gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In particular, it had not been established that the Tribunal made a finding that was a critical step in its ultimate conclusion for which there was no evidence in support in the manner considered in SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 or that there was no evidence in relation to a jurisdictional fact or essential preliminary in the decision-making process (see VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Federal Magistrate also referred to the discussion by Greenwood J in SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] in relation to the limits of the no evidence ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Her Honour found (at [23]) that "the generally expressed contention in ground one of the application for review does not establish that this is such a case or that the Tribunal findings on credibility should on that basis be disturbed (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at [67] )".</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In oral submissions at the hearing of this appeal the appellant contended, in effect, that the Tribunal's judgment was not fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In my view, no error can be found in the above reasoning of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In essence, ground 1 and the appellant's oral submission invite the Court to undertake merits review --- going beyond legal review --- of the Tribunal's decision, which is not its function: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang &amp; Ors [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Ground 1 must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">GROUND 2: THE TRIBUNAL DECISION TOOK THE FOLLOWING IRRELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS INTO ACCOUNT IN THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER: THE GENERAL COUNTRY INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTS OF MY CASE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 It does not appear that this claim was directly raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In any event, it is well settled that the choice of, and weight given to, independent information is a matter for the Tribunal: NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 ; Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 464 per French J at [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In this case, it cannot be said that the Tribunal relied on 'irrelevant material' (Cf Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In this case the Tribunal regarded relevant country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">However, as noted above, the Tribunal's decision was based on its appraisal of the appellant's claims having regard to the visitor visa application, the protection visa application and her oral evidence to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">For the reasons it gave it found that the appellant was lacking credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Ground 2 must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">GROUND 3: THE TRIBUNAL IS REQUIRED BY S 424A OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 TO GIVE THE APPLICANT NOTICE OF THE PARTICULARS OF THE INFORMATION AND THE REASON WHY THE TRIBUNAL CONSIDERED IT RELEVANT TO THE CASE, THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO DO SO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 The Tribunal wrote to the appellant pursuant to s 424A in a letter dated 7 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The particulars of the relevant information related to information contained on the departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On 1 April 2008 the Tribunal received a response from the appellant, which it took into account, but ultimately did not accept due to the inconsistencies in her evidence (see AB 70).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">No error can be found in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Nor was there any other information which was required to be put to the appellant pursuant to s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The only information before the Tribunal was that contained in the departmental file, the delegate's decision, and that provided by the appellant for the purpose of the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Ultimately, the Tribunal found that the evidence given by the appellant was inconsistent, and that she was not a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is well settled that the Tribunal's thought appraisals of an applicant's evidence do not enliven the obligations under s 424A(1): SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In oral submissions at the hearing of the appeal, the appellant did not identify any particular information relied on by the Tribunal of which she was not given notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">OTHER CONSIDERATION 
 No error of law can be otherwise detected in the decision of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Nor can any other jurisdictional error be detected in the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Tribunal identified with particularity all of the appellant's claims and supporting material before it; explored her claims with her at a hearing; raised with the her the inconsistencies in her evidence and doubts over her claims (both at hearing and in the s 424A letter sent on 7 March 2008); made findings based on the evidence and material before it; and, applied the correct law to its findings in reaching its conclusion that it was not satisfied that the appellant was a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 In my opinion, the approach of the Federal Magistrate and her Honour's conclusions do not reveal appealable error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Additionally, there is nothing to suggest the Tribunal committed any jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Barker.</sentence>
