 1 This is an application by a Notice of Motion filed on 6 June 2006 seeking orders pursuant to O 15A r 8 of the Federal Court of Australia Rules in respect of non-party discovery from five financial institutions, the National Australia Bank, the Bank of Queensland, the Australia and New Zealand Bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd ('the five financial institutions').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The reason for the application which is, as the cases show, out of the ordinary, is to be found, amongst other things, in the fact that the second respondent has claimed privilege against self-incrimination as a basis for refusing to meet discovery orders given by Greenwood J on 28 April 2006, which orders were in the context of asset preservation orders made against the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 One of those orders in respect of which privilege against self-incrimination has been claimed by Mr Wallader required him to depose to all bank accounts controlled by him in the period immediately after the payment to a company of which he was a director of US $2,000,000.00 by the applicant in the principal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Pursuant to that privilege, which as I found by reasons given on 5 June 2006 he is entitled to claim, there has not been production of financial records, memoranda of account or financial statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 This Notice of Motion seeks non-party discovery against the banks in respect of those accounts and financial records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">5 Having regard to the material which I can refer to compendiously as being contained in the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J for the orders that his Honour made on 28 April 2006, and for the reasons which I gave on 5 June 2006 in respect of a Notice of Motion filed by Mr Wallader concerning the question of privilege against self-incrimination, and in respect of the relief sought in the Notice of Motion filed 6 June 2006 by the applicant, in my opinion it is appropriate for the Court to make orders sought by the Notice of Motion against the five financial institutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">6 O 15A, r 8 provides:
 
 '8 Discovery from non-party 
 The Court may order that a person who is not a party and in respect of whom it appears that the person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had in the person's possession any document which relates to any question in the proceeding shall make discovery to the applicant of any such document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">' 
 

7 There are a number of aspects to which specific attention should be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Having regard to O 15A r 11 it was appropriate for the Court to ask, and for the applicant to proffer, an undertaking to pay the reasonable costs of each of the financial institutions for complying with the non-party order for discovery for non-party production of documents and for those costs to be the applicant's costs in the principal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It is also appropriate to note that the timeframe in which it is proposed that non-party production occur is seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It may be that either because of the extended discovery or of the nature of the documents or for any other possible reason that timeframe might be too short or otherwise the compliance with the orders might be unfair or oppressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">8 What the applicant is seeking by these orders is to find out what happened to US $200,000,100.00 transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It seems to me that the applicants want to know what happened to the moneys that it paid into the nominated account of Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd at the National Australia Bank, Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">And the production of documents which I propose to order is in relation to finding out what happened to that amount and, in particular, whether any of the nominated accounts or the financial records of the specified companies had anything to do with that disposition of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">9 The court accepts the undertaking offered by the applicant to pay the reasonable costs of each of the National Australia Bank, the Bank of Queensland, the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd of complying with these orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">10 The Court orders that:
