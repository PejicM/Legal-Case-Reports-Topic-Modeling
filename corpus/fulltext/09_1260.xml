<sentence id="s0">
 This is an interlocutory motion to strike out a pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The trial in the action is imminent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For an understanding of events to date these reasons would need to be read with earlier judgments in Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 832 ; (2009) 258 ALR 464 and Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 1048.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">By a very recent amended defence the third respondent (Castleworld) raises a new plea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It is, in substance, that upon Castleworld becoming a registered proprietor of the land in question (the Dongara Land), the interest which was held by Castleworld became and continues to be indefeasible within the meaning of the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA) (TLA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">As such it took priority and continues to take priority over any estate, title or interest the applicants may claim under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Therefore it was free and continues to be free from any interest or encumbrances that were not registered as at the date of acquisition on 3 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Because of that recent pleading there has also been an amendment to the applicants' reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">They plead (at para 9(c)), amongst other things, that it is to be inferred from the particularised matters that Castleworld acted fraudulently to procure its registration as the registered proprietor of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There are then 21 subparagraphs of particulars which might be divided into three categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The first category was that Mr Naude, on behalf of Castleworld, was at all relevant times the sole director and shareholder of Castleworld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Castleworld, through him, knew at all relevant times, prior to acquisition of the interest in the Dongara land of the applicants' caveated interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He (and it) knew this from information allegedly received from solicitors acting for the first and second respondents concerning the nature of the applicants' claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He also knew, it is said, by receipt, on 9 January 2007, of a copy of a letter from the solicitors, which stated, in substance, the nature of the applicants' claim and that the applicants had threatened to commence proceedings in respect of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The second broad category of matters, particularised at length, is that Castleworld, in effect, knowingly provided false information as to the value of the Dongara Land to a financier, to enable acquisition of the Dongara Land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The third element is that Castleworld did not at any time, prior to its registration as proprietor of the Dongara Land, notify the applicants of the fact that it intended to purchase or had purchased the Dongara Land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicants say it is those elements, taken together, that lead to an inference that Castleworld acted fraudulently for the purposes of the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA, and as pleaded by Castleworld, in order to procure registration as the registered proprietor of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There are two primary complaints raised today by Castleworld in respect of the pleading in the reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The first is that none of the matters pleaded in the 21 particulars demonstrate that the actions taken by Castleworld were taken for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the Dongara Land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The second is that it is impossible to treat an alleged fraud on the financier as being the sort of statutory fraud which will defeat the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">For those general propositions, reliance is placed on a number of cases, but in particular the analysis in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 ; (2007) 230 CLR 89 , in a joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As against that for the applicants, in support of maintaining the recent pleading of fraud in the reply, it is argued that the jurisdiction to strike-out is to be sparingly invoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The case must be very clear indeed to warrant the summary intervention of the Court and the test can be formulated in various ways, but essentially, the claim or defence, as the case may be --- and in this case it is a reply --- must be so obviously untenable that it cannot succeed, or is manifestly groundless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These submissions are correct and unchallenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicants also concede that the pleading is novel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It is novel in the sense that, at least on research done to date, it appears to be without direct precedent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is an allegation, in substance, that Castleworld intentionally or recklessly misled its financier, in order to obtain the necessary funds for the acquisition of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The question, as both parties acknowledge, is whether those facts raise an arguable case of fraud on the part of Castleworld within the meaning of s 68 of the TLA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to explore all the realms of fraud which might arise on the cases, but it is clear that statutory fraud for the purposes of the provisions under consideration, and particularly s 68 of the TLA, is a narrower concept than that at general law: Bank of South Australia v Ferguson [1998] HCA 12 ; (1998) 192 CLR 248 and Bahr v Nicolay (No 2) [1988] HCA 16 ; (1987) 164 CLR 604 at 614.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">ANALYSIS 
 Assuming the pleaded facts to be correct, there is arguably a fraud as against the financier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I stress that the facts are not proven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It is clear that the fraud must be by the registered proprietor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That requirement is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The question which really falls for consideration at present is whether, as a matter of principle, the pleaded fraud against the financier, if established, is a fraud for the purpose of the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Wilson J held in Unic v Quartermain Holdings Proprietary Limited (2002) 2 Qd R 660 at [26] that the essential question was the causal link between the fraud and the loss of interest in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The causal link here is pleaded, that is to say para 9(c) pleads that the fraud which was conducted was conducted for the purpose of defeating the applicant's claimed interest in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Once, again I emphasise that none of the pleaded facts is yet established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Whether such a causal link can be shown after the evidence is heard and whether such a causal link will be sufficient for the purposes of the fraud exception to indefeasibility contained in s 68 TLA remains to be seen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The factual matter pleaded and the legal argument raised, are novel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">They advance arguments which may not previously have directly arisen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Nevertheless, it is a fundamental point of principle in litigation that if a case is arguable the applicants should not be shut out from running it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In my view, taking all of the three elements together, as particulars in support of the purpose pleaded in para 9(c), it cannot be said, despite their novelty, the pleading is unarguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">That being so, I will decline to strike-out para 9(c) of the reply and the motion of Castleworld will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I am satisfied for the reasons Ms Cahill has argued, that costs should follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The motion will be dismissed and Castleworld will be ordered to pay the costs of the applicants, to be taxed or agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice McKerracher.</sentence>
