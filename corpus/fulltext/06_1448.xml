 1 This is an appeal from the decision of Scarlett FM made on 16 June 2006 ( SZIIZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 939) dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to refuse the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellant is a national of Pakistan who is a Shia Muslim claiming a well-founded fear of persecution in that country by reason of his association with a group known as the TNFJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 After the refusal of his application by a delegate of the Minister, the appellant lodged an application with the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 21 November 2005, the Tribunal advised the appellant that as it was unable to make a decision in his favour on the information before it, he was invited to an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant signed a Response to Hearing Invitation form indicating he did not wish to attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Consequently, no hearing was conducted and the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Naturally, an important aspect of that finding was the fact that the appellant had not attended the hearing in order to supplement the information which the Tribunal had before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The appellant then filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking relief in the nature of prerogative relief to set aside the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Scarlett FM affirmed the decision of the Tribunal on 16 June 2006 and it is from that judgment that this appeal is brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I was born on 06/12/1976 in the city of Mian Channu in district Khanewal of Punjab province Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I hail from a religious family and we have all the affiliations with Tehrik Nafaed Faqia Jafaria (TNFJ) mian channu district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 My father is a head of the Mian Channu TNFJ committee of the TNFJ within the district of Khanewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As I am a born Shia Muslim and very soon I was a front line worker and preacher of the shia faith within the TNFJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">SSP is also a very strong in our area and they are very strong hardliner militant people and they use to create disturbance in our meeting many times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The SSP workers in Khanewal kidnapped me in the month of February.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I was blindfolded and was taken to a place far away from Khanewal city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It was almost a jungle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">They took me to a house where I saw the armed men and there the SSP people mercilessly beat me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 I need protection for my life because my family in Pakistan facing high level of mental and physical torture I the upcoming hearing I will provide death certificate of my cousin who was killed by the SSP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">After that shocking death of my cousin the SSP lodged an police report (FIR) against my brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This is a vital proof of religious heated Sunni society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I am going through a great level of stress; my family members are hiding because of fear of Sunni hardliners approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As a Shia Muslim I need a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">' 
 

The grounds do not identify or isolate any error in the judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate and identify no ground of appeal in a conventional sense at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 5 The appellant's written submissions do not fill that gap but expand further upon the factual bases for the claim to a protection visa and, as with his oral submissions, seek to invite this Court to consider fresh material as, indeed, the appellant had also invited the learned Federal Magistrate to consider fresh material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 I have read the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is perfectly conventional in form and points out the fundamental difficulty which this appellant has by reason of his failure to attend the Tribunal's hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">7 In my opinion, the appeal is totally without merit and should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The orders of the Court are: 
 
 (1) the appeal is dismissed;
 (2) the appellant is to pay the costs of the first respondent, assessed at $5000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">



 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
