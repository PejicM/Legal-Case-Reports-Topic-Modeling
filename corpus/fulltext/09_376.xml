<sentence id="s0">
 Jemella Australia Pty Ltd (hereafter Jemella Australia), has instituted proceedings in respect of what it alleges to be an infringement of a registered Australian trademark, being trademark registration number 951664.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The trademark comprises the letters GHD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The owner of that trademark is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, Jemella Limited, (hereafter Jemella UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Jemella UK is the parent company of Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It has authorised Jemella Australia to use the GHD mark relevantly in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Jemella UK has necessarily been joined to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Its stance, though, unsurprisingly, is to support their institution and the seeking of the relief claimed by Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The substantive Respondent is a lady who resides in Victoria, Ms Liane Cherie Boutcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Ms Boutcher was served with the originating application and has appeared on occasion, although not on every occasion, that a directions hearing has been held in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She has been permitted to appear by telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">There is a convenience associated with the adoption of that course so far as Ms Boutcher is concerned, although my experience of the use of telephone directions hearings in this case with Ms Boutcher is that it can have the disadvantage of not bringing home to a respondent litigant in person the responsibilities entailed in litigation in a court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Be this as it may, at the last directions hearing at which Ms Boutcher did attend by telephone, I fixed today as the date for the trial of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That seemed to me to be the more convenient course to take, rather than to continue to deal with a difficulty in relation to her compliance with an order for discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As events transpired today, when the case was called on for hearing, Ms Boutcher did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The absence of an appearance on her part at the date fixed for trial was, strictly speaking, an event of default in terms of O 35A r 2(2)(h).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Jemella Australia adopted the course of proceeding to lead evidence on the trial rather than seeking to have judgment entered in default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the circumstances of this particular case, that seems to me to have been the prudent and just course to take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I make that observation because there is a defence on file and also what at least purports to be an affidavit from Ms Boutcher as to, inter alia, the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Jemella Australia had given to Ms Boutcher a notice to attend for cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It was envisaged on behalf of Jemella Australia's legal representative that she would be cross-examined on the trial on her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The issue which falls for determination in respect of the case is, firstly, whether or not the applicant is indeed a person entitled to bring this proceeding in respect of a registered trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The evidence before me is quite clear in its establishing that the mark to which I have referred does appear on the Register of Trade Marks under the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (Trade Marks Act) and, further, that the holder of that trademark has granted to Jemella Australia a licence and has authorised it to bring the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The question then becomes whether or not there has been an importation which infringes that particular mark?</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Part 13 of the Trade Marks Act is directed to the subject of the importation of goods infringing Australian trademarks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It makes provision for the seizure of goods, which an objector notifies to the Australian Customs Service by the Customs, upon their being landed in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It then confers a cause of action which can lead to the forfeiture of goods at the behest of the objector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In addition, in that infringement proceeding an applicant may, in the ordinary way, additionally claim damages or an account for profits and injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">That is what has occurred in terms of the application brought by Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I was informed when the case was called on for trial in Jemella Australia's opening that it was not desired on its part to press for either an account for profits or for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Further, rather than seek an order that the goods be released to it, Jemella Australia's claim was that the goods should be forfeited to the Commonwealth as s 139 and s 137 envisage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">On 12 December 2008, Ms Boutcher filed what purported to be a defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The bulk of that document was, in a technical sense, frivolous in that it provided for what were not truly defences and, for that matter, was cast in terms which one might regard as either scandalous or irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I struck out those portions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">What was left was a bare denial by her of the claims made by Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The evidence from Jemella Australia establishes that there were four hair stylers landed in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I am quite satisfied, on the evidence, that the person who sought to import the stylers was Ms Boutcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Indeed, she effectively admits as much in an affidavit which was filed on 9 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">An affidavit of Kelly Maree Gardner filed on 26 September 2008 contains as exhibits photographs of the hair stylers as landed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">One sees reproduced there, inter alia , an alphanumeric code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Jemella Australia's evidence is that the code as reproduced in evidence on the four stylers imported is not a genuine code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I am satisfied on the evidence that the four hair stylers in question are counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">By that, I mean that they have not been manufactured by or on behalf of either the applicant, Jemella Australia, or, for that matter, its parent company, Jemella UK.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">A question then arises as to whether or not the importation, or strictly the attempted importation, constitutes an infringement?</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Ms Boutcher's affidavit filed on 9 October 2008 contains some material which I regarded as irrelevant and of a nature such that it ought not to be able to be searched on the court file without the leave of the court or a judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Apart from that, it does, though, contain an account by her of her reasons for seeking to import the four stylers in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Mr Fox, who appeared for Jemella Australia, quite properly drew my attention to those parts of that affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In the affidavit Ms Boutcher deposes in that regard: 
 I have purchased the four hair straightening irons for personal use only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I, Liane Cherie Boutcher, have bought four due to the fact I have my own home, my mother's home and my father's home that I have bought one for, and, as I am a model and a hairdresser and have school and other obligations to attend to on a regular basis, I have purchased an extra hair straightening iron to keep in my car in case of an "emergency".</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Also please observe that I have purchased four different colours and styles of the GHD hair straightening iron for "fun" [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 Ms Gardner, who is the occupant of a position known as "brand protection officer" with Jemella Australia, has taken, as one might expect from her position, some interest in internet sites in which one finds advertisements for GHD products for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">She reviews such sites regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The course of her review has disclosed that there are two types of site to be found on the net: 
(a) what she describes as trades websites, and she gives examples of these; and
 
(b) what she describes as retail websites, and, again, she gives examples of these;
 
each of these being sites which advertise what she knows from her corporate knowledge to be solely counterfeit GHD products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Her experience with what she terms "retail websites" is that they do not have a minimum quantity which must be purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">With what she has termed "trade websites", these usually also do not provide for a minimum order, but where they do, the minimum order is usually 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">She states that she has not viewed any advertisement on a trade website which specifies a minimum of four.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Her experience is also that a supplier is often prepared to what she terms "drop ship" counterfeit products; in other words, send a single unit direct to a customer's address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">There is also evidence before me that, in the ordinary course, one way in which genuine GHD hairstyling products are marketed is via hairdressers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I have not had the benefit of seeing Ms Boutcher so as to form an assessment, on that basis, of her credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It does seem to me somewhat unlikely that four products would be purchased for the reasons that she gives; unlikely, but not impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I note that she gives her occupation as both model as well as hairdresser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The latter, of course, does raise a concern in terms of an ability, at least inferentially, to offer counterfeit hairstyling irons to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Jemella Australia is not obliged to prove an infringement to demonstration; only on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">At first blush, an importation of four does seem to be rather more than one might readily regard as a purchase for personal use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Further, at first blush, it does seem to be a little unlikely that one would have four items placed at the locations which Ms Boutcher mentions in her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The hairstyler in question, as the photographs make evident, is not a large item.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It seems to be one which is, and is designed to be, readily portable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the stylers which were seized by the Customs were not items intended for personal use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">As I say, the question is one where, with the benefit of seeing Ms Boutcher, and perhaps hearing her enlarge upon her reasons in cross-examination, a different view may have been open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">She has, though, for reasons which doubtless seemed good to her, chosen not to attend at the date fixed for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In so doing, she has necessarily deprived me, as trial judge, of the benefit of the elaboration that she might have been able to provide in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Her absence from court does not, in any way, prove Jemella Australia's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">All it means is that inferences which arise on the face of the evidence adduced by Jemella Australia - first blush impressions, as I have termed them - are not challenged by any further evidence from her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">That being so, it becomes unnecessary to consider a further submission which was made in the alternative on behalf of Jemella Australia, that an infringement might nonetheless arise for the purposes of Pt 13 of the Act, at least, even if the goods concerned were imported for personal use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">As, on the facts I have found, that is an academic question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is preferable that I do not express an opinion as to the merits of that particular question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It would seem, having regard to the factual findings that I have made, desirable also to grant to Jemella Australia the injunctive relief that it seeks in relation to any further dealings by Ms Boutcher in relation to products which would infringe the mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Jemella Australia has, then, established a case entitling it to an order that the goods be forfeited to the Commonwealth, and, further, for injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">After I had delivered judgment, Mr Fox, on behalf of Jemella Australia, sought that I fix costs in an amount in the order of $13,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Notice had not been given to Ms Boutcher of the intention on behalf of Jemella Australia to seek costs in that amount and, in so doing, to provide her in advance with an assessment of those costs, along with a short-form bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I indicated to Mr Fox that I considered that the requirements of procedural fairness in relation to costs were such that I should not proceed to allow costs in that particular amount without extending an opportunity to Ms Boutcher to be heard about the adoption of that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">At an earlier stage in the proceedings, and at a time when Jemella Australia envisaged that it would seek a default judgment, an affidavit of Kelly Maree Gardner was filed on 12 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">That affidavit, at some length, set out a rationale, and it must be said it is a compelling rationale, why costs in the amount of $8000, as at that stage of proceedings, ought to have been allowed to Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">That particular affidavit was served upon Ms Boutcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Since then, in the ordinary course of events, other costs, on a party and party basis, must necessarily have been incurred by Jemella Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Again, in the ordinary course of events, the way in which the cost discretion would fall for exercise in this case, having regard to its disposition, is that Ms Boutcher would have to pay the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">I can see nothing in the conduct of proceedings on behalf of Jemella Australia that would deprive it of an entitlement to its costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">So the only question, effectively, would become whether or not costs ought to be fixed or taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Having regard to the episodic engagement by Ms Boutcher with these proceedings, it seems to me that to order the taxation of costs would be to impose an unnecessary burden both on Jemella Australia as well as, it must be said, Ms Boutcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">I say "unnecessary" because it seems to me that, on any view, a taxing officer would necessarily allow at least the sum of $8000 on a party and party basis in respect of the costs incurred by Jemella Australia up to and including trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The rationale set out in the affidavit of Ms Gardner filed on 12 March is eloquent in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">That being so, it seems to me that the just course to take in this instance is to fix costs in the amount of $8000, to grant liberty to apply within fourteen (14) days of today's date in respect the order for costs, to direct that the judgment not be entered for a period of fourteen (14) days insofar as it relates to costs, and that, in default of any submission within fourteen (14) days, the judgment in respect of costs fixed in the sum of $8000 to be entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I further direct that a copy of the orders made today be served on Ms Boutcher by prepaid post at the address which she has given for service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">As to substantive orders, the orders that I make are: Pursuant to s 126 of the Trade Marks Act , the First Respondent, whether by herself, her servants, agents, or otherwise howsoever, be restrained from importing, promoting, distributing, advertising, offering for sale, displaying or otherwise using counterfeit hairstyling products bearing the marking "GHD hairstyling iron," "GHD hairstyler," or "GHD," or otherwise infringing registered trademark numbered 951664, being the letters "GHD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">" I further order that the goods, being four hairstyling irons described as "GHD branded hair straighteners" seized pursuant to s 133 of the Trade Marks Act on 18 August 2008, as described in the notice of seizure to objector of that date, be forfeited to the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I will direct that the applicant bring in short minutes to reflect the orders made today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Associate:
 
 
Dated: 22 April 2009
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: Mr L Fox (In-house Solicitor for the Applicant) 
 
 Solicitor for the First Respondent: There was no appearance by the First Respondent 
 Date of Hearing: 17 April 2009
