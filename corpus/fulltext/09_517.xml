<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia (Lloyd-Jones FM) made on 20 June 2008 dismissing the appellant's application for orders for the issue of the Constitutional writs of certiorari and mandamus in relation to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") made on 6 October 2006 and published on 19 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal by its decision affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate to reject the appellant's application for a Protection Visa under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Tribunal's decision of 6 October 2006 is the second decision of the Tribunal, differently constituted from the first, in the exercise or purported exercise of the Tribunal's statutory review function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first decision made on 30 March 2005 and published on 19 April 2005 affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate was set aside by the Federal Magistrates Court by consent on 29 March 2006 and was remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant sought to quash a second decision of the Tribunal on three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They were that the second Tribunal had not been reconstituted according to law having regard to the relevant provisions of the Migration Act ; that the Tribunal failed to discharge its statutory review function in that it failed to consider whether the appellant's so called "residual motive" in seeking protection gave rise to a well-founded fear of persecution; and, that the Tribunal was affected by apprehended bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The appellant was unsuccessful on all three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant filed a Notice of Appeal before this Court on 11 July 2008 which raised three grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant represented by Mr Newman of Newman &amp; Associates, sought to abandon the prosecution of any of those grounds and sought leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to rely upon one new ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant now contends that the primary judge erred by failing to find jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal as it disregarded: 
 ... much of the appellant's corroborative evidence without ascribing reasons or, alternatively, misapplying the ruling in SZANI v MIMIA [2004] FCA 1298 , Tamberlin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">

 In further elaboration of that ground, the appellant says the Tribunal failed to exercise its statutory review function as it applied, in error, an analytical method of first assessing the creditworthiness of the appellant and then, having formed an unfavourable view of the appellant's credibility, concluded, wrongly, that it was entitled to reject the whole of the appellant's corroborative evidence without subjecting that evidence to any assessment or ascribing any reasons for rejecting the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Minister opposes the application for leave to amend the notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Notice of Appeal filed on 11 July 2008 is a handwritten notice filed by the appellant under her own hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">She does not appear to have been represented by a lawyer in preparing and filing that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant was initially represented in the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings by Mr Newman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">For reasons which do not need to be repeated here, the hearing of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court was adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Turner of Parish Patience Immigration Lawyers appeared for the appellant on the adjournment application and later acted for her in the conduct of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Newman now acts for the appellant in the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The appellant as advised by Mr Newman now seeks to agitate the new and only ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Minister contends that the subject matter of the new ground was not argued in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It could have been argued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant was represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Nevertheless, Mr Kennett on behalf of the Minister has prepared written submissions addressing the new ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Having regard to the history of the matter, it seems to me that the interests of justice are served by granting leave to amend the Notice of Appeal so as to enable the appellant to argue the ground of appeal now thought, on advice, to be meritorious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Accordingly, leave to amend is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born in 1970 in the town of Khanigawn in the area of Parbat, Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">She was a member of the Brahmin caste and was brought up within Nepal's Hindu community and Hindu culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">She married in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">She is the mother of two sons born in 1990 and 1993 both of whom remain in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The appellant arrived in Australia on 19 December 2003 in reliance on a visitor's visa issued in Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">She applied for a Protection Visa on 7 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The appellant claims to hold a well-founded fear of persecution should she return to Nepal, due to the political opinions she holds and expresses as a supporter of the ideology of the Maoist movement within the Nepalese Communist Party; the Christian religion she embraces and feels compelled to proselytize; her abandonment of Hindu beliefs and traditions in favour of the Christian faith; and the difficult social position she would endure in Nepal as a widow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">She contended that due to these considerations she would be in physical danger from the authorities in Nepal, individuals within the Maoist movement in Nepal, Hindu nationalists, her father as he is a Brahmin shamed by his daughter's conversion to Christianity and, as to her social status in Nepal, by some members of the wider community in that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The factual content of these claims is contained in the appellant's handwritten answers to questions in the application form for the visa and statutory declarations she swore on 20 February 2004, 9 June 2004, 10 January 2005 and 17 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant also gave oral evidence at the first Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">She also swore a further consolidating statutory declaration on 2 June 2006 and gave further oral evidence before the second Tribunal at a hearing on 19 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In her consolidating statutory declaration sworn on 2 June 2006, the appellant addressed a number of inconsistencies in her oral evidence given to the first Tribunal hearing as compared with earlier written answers and statutory declarations put before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The appellant said those inconsistencies were due to the difficulties she experienced in communicating with a Tamil migration agent who had a limited understanding of her Hindi language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">She said her English language skills were not very good and to the extent that any earlier documents contained material inconsistent with her declaration of 2 June 2006, those documents were incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The central factual contentions of the appellant of importance were these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The appellant's husband had been a member of the Communist Party of Nepal, a very active member of a Maoist group within that party and a Maoist District Commander for the region of Parbat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As a result, the appellant's husband was always hiding from the Nepalese authorities, would visit his wife and children every three, six or eight months and would come and go in secret.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He would not tell her any details of his political activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The appellant contended that her husband had been killed in a clash between Maoist activists and the Nepalese army.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There was confusion in the appellant's material before the Tribunal as to the month and year of her husband's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The appellant contended that she was sympathetic to her husband's Maoist ideals although she was not a person who engaged in acts of violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">She said she supported the Maoists by distributing literature and medicines amongst the people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">She contended that before her husband died, the army and police used to come to her house and question her about her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">They would do so two or three times a month to search the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">A few months before her husband died, a number of policemen took her to a building for questioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">She was threatened with rape, beaten and raped, although she could not remember exactly what had happened to her during that ordeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">She said that she was knocked unconscious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">During a period of approximately one or two years before her husband's death, there were many incidents when members of the police or the army interrogated her about her husband's whereabouts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Apart from the interrogation and rape or suspected rape just mentioned, the appellant contended before the second Tribunal in her oral evidence that policemen used to come to her house when her husband was away engaged in Maoist activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">These men used to demand information from her under threat of rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">She said that when she could not tell them where her husband was since she did not know, they would rape her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In her oral evidence she said that these events occurred over a four year period prior to her husband's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The circumstances of her husband's death in a battle with the Nepalese army, and seeing her husband's body, were traumatic events for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">After her husband's death, she was helped by Maoist sympathisers, continued to support Maoist principles and continued to assist Maoist sympathisers in the distribution of pamphlets and medicines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She contended that in 1998 after her husband's death, her father-in-law took steps to obtain a passport for her to leave Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The passport was issued on 7 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">She contended that one day in November 1999 her father-in-law told her to go with him to Kathmandu Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">She was given a passport and ticket and told she was to fly to Hong Kong to be met by a person who would employ her in domestic service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">She worked for that person and his family for two years and then another family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The second employer obtained a renewal of the appellant's passport, that is, a new passport on 7 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The appellant came to Australia with that family on 19 December 2003, fled from her employer and applied for a Protection Visa on 7 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">These events were examined closely and in great detail by the Tribunal as the appellant initially said she left Nepal from Kathmandu in August 2002 and although each passport was issued after her husband's death, each passport nominated her husband as her next-of-kin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In support of these contentions, the appellant relied on four witness statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">She also relied on a letter addressed "To Whom it May Concern" under the letterhead of the "Human Rights Educational Radio Audience Club (Rilek-Nepal) District Section --- Chitwan".</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In the first statement (in order of the Appeal Book) Bhim Kharel says that he came to Australia on 5 June 1996, is a permanent resident and has known the appellant and her husband for over 15 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He asserts that because the appellant and her husband supported Maoist political activities in Nepal, the appellant's husband was killed by Nepalese authorities and the appellant was detained on a number of occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">He says that she was denied employment and ostracised by the society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He says he grew up in the same village as the appellant and her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The second statement is by Rita Kharel of the same address as Bhim Kharel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She says she knew the appellant and her family in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">She says that the appellant has a psychological fear that if she returns to Nepal she will be arrested and tortured due to her membership of a Maoist organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">She says the appellant may commit suicide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The third statement is by Choodamani Pramod.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">He says he has seen many incidents in Nepal during clashes between the Nepalese army and Maoist groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">He says he knew of the appellant and her family in his district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He says, "We all used to move from one place to another place".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">He says he has a strong belief the appellant would be detained by Nepalese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The fourth statement is by Grishma Kharel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">She says that she knew the appellant and her husband from her village in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">She says the appellant's husband was very popular, helped people and was generally known as a leader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">She sets out her beliefs about particular problems in Nepal and her belief that the appellant would be isolated from Nepalese society due to her and her husband's past activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The witnesses also gave oral testimony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">A medical report was also put in evidence that addressed the appellant's physical and emotional condition and referred to certain burn scars on the appellant's back which she claimed she sustained during an event of torture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The fifth document is the letter previously mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The author says that based on information supplied to him (or the agency) the appellant's husband was an active member of a Maoist organisation and was killed in June 1998 in a battle between the Nepalese army and Maoist rebels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The appellant also put before the Tribunal a statement from a social worker associated with the Jesus Family Centre which the appellant regularly attends as part of her Christian devotions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">A medical report dated 2 June 2006 concerning her condition was also put before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">At AB282 (p 8 of the Tribunal's reasons), the Tribunal describes the evidence of Bhim Kharel, Choodamani Pramod and Grishma Kharel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The evidence of Bhim Kharel is also noted at AB286 (p 12 of the Tribunal's reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Human Rights letter is addressed at AB287 (p 13 of the Tribunal's reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Tribunal in very extensive reasons extending over 33 pages, analysed each of the claims made by the appellant and the evolution of those claims through the course of the appellant's written answers, statutory declarations, oral evidence and responses to letters from the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Plainly enough, the Tribunal was concerned about fundamental inconsistencies in the evidence and statements made to the Tribunal by the appellant over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Although it is not necessary to recite in these reasons each of the findings made by the Tribunal arising out of its perception of important inconsistencies, some of the findings ought to be mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Tribunal said this: 
 The Tribunal finds that the Applicant has not provided impressive evidence of an alignment with the Maoists (actual or imputed) on her part or on her husband's part (AB302); 

 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Applicant's inconsistent evidence as to the level and formality of her involvement in the Maoists cannot be so simply overlooked (AB302); 

 
 The Applicant gave inconsistent evidence to the Tribunals as to the level of communication between herself and her husband about his, and their, Maoist activities (AB302); 

 
 The Tribunal has considered the Applicant's explanation for not revealing the full nature of alleged sexual abuse suffered by her at the hands of the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The Tribunal is of the view that the Applicant's claims about the traumatic nature of the torture she suffered do not satisfactorily explain discrepancies in her evidence as to when the pattern of torture began.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal does not accept that the nature of the abuse the Applicant supposedly received from the police, over four years leading up to the alleged death of her husband, provides a satisfactory reason for having told the previously-constituted Tribunal that abuse by the police only started after her husband died (AB303); 

 
 The Applicant has in very recent times given highly inconsistent evidence as to the "pattern" of sexual abuse she supposedly suffered at the hands of Nepalese officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">She claimed as recently as 2 June 2006 that there was one "possible" instance of rape prior to her husband's death but that she was unconscious and could not tell for sure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Only a few weeks later she was citing a four-year history of rape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Tribunal finds that it cannot rely on the Applicant's evidence about rape by Nepalese officials (AB303); 

 
 The Tribunal accepts that the Applicant has some scars on her body and that these may also be burn scars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">However, on the highly inconsistent evidence provided by the Applicant, the Tribunal does not accept that they are scars relating to injuries sustained in circumstances claimed by the Applicant (AB303); 

 
 The Tribunal is concerned as to the highly inconsistent evidence the Applicant gave regarding the alleged date of her husband's alleged death, and also concerned as to inconsistencies regarding the period between that alleged death and the Applicant's November 1999 departure for Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Meanwhile, the Tribunal was struck by shifts in the Applicant's evidence as to the motivation she attributed to her father-in-law for securing her a job in Hong Kong (AB303); 

 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The Tribunal finds it cannot rely on claims about the Applicant's husband having died prior to the Applicant's application for a passport, let alone in the circumstances claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal gives weight to the entry in the Applicant's passport attesting to her husband being alive at least at the time of the application for the passport (AB304).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">

 The Tribunal concluded at AB305 that central aspects of the claims made by the appellant were a fabrication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Having examined these inconsistencies which led the Tribunal to the conclusions identified, the Tribunal made this observation about the witness statements: 
 Given the nature and degree of the credibility problems with the Applicant's own evidence, the Tribunal finds that it cannot give weight to the information from the Applicant's witnesses attesting to her Maoist connections, or those of her husband, or relating to any consequences of such connections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Tribunal has duly considered material such as the 2 June 2006 medical report and the Jesus Family Centre's social worker's statement but finds that it cannot give these such weight as can help resolve the Applicant's credibility problems in relation to her claims about abuse in Nepal (AB304).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">

 Immediately preceding those observations, the Tribunal contextualised its conclusions concerning the weight and utility of the witness statements by making this observation: 
 In SZANI v MIMIA [2004] S[F]CA 1298 Tamberlin J referred to the decision of WAEJ v MIMIA [2003] FCAFC 188 where the Full Court at page [para] 52 said: 

 
 "On its face the foregoing was a statement by the RRT that the document was not authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">This was not a case where dishonesty on the part of the appellant had been demonstrated thereby providing support for the further conclusion that the appellant had arranged for the preparation, and tender of, a non authentic, or forged, document which the RRT could disregard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">There was no finding by the RRT that the evidence of the appellant was so discredited that any purportedly corroborative material presented on his behalf could be discarded without further analysis (emphasis added by the Full Federal Court).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">" 
 [There is no emphasis in the quoted passage] 

 The sequence of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal seems to have been reflected in four steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Firstly, the Tribunal has "duly considered" the information from the appellant's witnesses relating to the appellant's engagement with Maoist groups or her husband's engagement with such groups and has duly considered information from these witnesses relating to the "consequences of such connections".</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Secondly, the nature and degree of the credibility problems the Tribunal has with the evidence of the appellant is such that the witness statements cannot be redemptive of the poisoned well of credibility, that is, the Tribunal cannot give the statements such weight "as can help resolve the appellant's credibility problems in relation to her claims about abuse in Nepal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Thirdly, guidance in the approach to the utility of corroborative statements can be found in the decision of Tamberlin J in SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298 and the reference in that decision to the reasons of the Full Court in WAEJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 188 , which suggest to the Tribunal that where there is a finding by the Tribunal that the evidence of the appellant is fundamentally "discredited", any purportedly corroborative material presented in support of a discredited version of events, may be discarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Fourthly, although the witness statements ought not to be discarded from due consideration, no weight should be attached to them in resolving the Tribunal's concern as to the appellant's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The appellant by her submissions made by Mr Newman, accepts that once a witness is found by the Tribunal to lack credibility, any documents that the witness tenders in corroboration of the primary evidence "may themselves be suspect".</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">However, oral corroborative evidence from a supporting witness is, it is said, in "a different class altogether".</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Before oral evidence can be rejected it must be found to be "flawed or tainted" in some way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Unless the evidence is assessed and reasons given for its rejection, the Tribunal has failed, it is said, to discharge its review function and has failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In this case, the Tribunal has considered the evidence of the witnesses called by the appellant and has concluded that the content of the evidence does not overcome the Tribunal's conclusions about the reliability of the primary evidence of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In SZANI v MIMIA , Tamberlin J concluded that the Tribunal's failure to make "any reference" [22] to the documents in question and the Tribunal's failure "to refer to, consider, or give reasons for rejection of the documents" [25] constituted jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In other words, the Tribunal had "ignored" relevant material in the sense contemplated by McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 223 at [82].</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">That is not this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Tribunal seems to have cited SZANI to illustrate the quoted reference to WAEJ v MIMIA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In that case, the Full Court, Lee, Hill and Marshall JJ at [52] noted the class of case where an appellant's evidence is so discredited that corroborative evidence presented in support of the primary claims "could be discarded without further analysis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The proper approach and one in which the resolution of this appeal is to be found is identified by Gleeson CJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [12] to [14]: 
 [12] It was contended that [the relevant passage] shows that the Tribunal member adopted a flawed approach to her evaluation of the evidence, failing to assess the evidence of the applicant/appellant in the light of the corroborating evidence, and giving no weight to the evidence of the corroborating witness for reasons that had nothing to do with the quality of that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The essence of the complaint is that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence as a whole, but first considered, and disbelieved, the evidence of the applicant/appellant, without taking account of the corroboration, and then considered and rejected the corroboration because of the rejection of the evidence of the applicant/appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I do not accept that this is a fair criticism of the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In my view, all that the member was saying was that, for reasons already given at length, she found the applicant/appellant's story implausible, and in some important respects unbelievable, and that she also rejected the evidence of the corroborating witness, even though she had no separate reason to doubt his credibility other than the reasons that she had already given for rejecting the claim she was considering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The member could have expressed herself more clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It is not necessarily irrational, or illogical, for a finder of fact, who is convinced that a principal witness is fabricating a story, which is considered to be inherently implausible, to reject corroborative evidence, even though there is no separate or independent ground for its rejection, apart from the reasons given for disbelieving the principal witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">

 
 [13] Upon analysis, the complaint is that the Tribunal member did not have regard to the whole of the evidence before deciding whether she believed the applicant/appellant, and did not properly assess the significance of the evidence of the corroborating witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">I am not persuaded that this criticism is justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">

 
 [14] Decision-makers commonly express their reasons sequentially; but that does not mean that they decide each factual issue in isolation from the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Ordinarily they review the whole of the evidence, and consider all issues of fact, before they write anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Expression of conclusions in a certain sequence does not indicate a failure to consider the evidence as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">I do not think that the Tribunal member intended to convey that she made up her mind about the evidence of the applicant/appellant before taking account of the evidence of the witness who was said to corroborate him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

 At [49], McHugh and Gummow JJ put the matter in these terms: In a dispute adjudicated by adversarial procedures, it is not unknown for a party's credibility to have been so weakened in cross-examination that the tribunal of fact may well treat what is proffered as corroborative evidence as of no weight because the well has been poisoned beyond redemption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It cannot be irrational for a decision-maker, enjoined by statute to apply inquisitorial processors (as here), to proceed on the footing that no corroboration can undo the consequences for a case put by a party of a conclusion that that case comprises lies by that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">If the critical passage in the reasons of the Tribunal be read as indicated above, the Tribunal is reasoning that, because the appellant cannot be believed, it cannot be satisfied with the alleged corroboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The appellant's argument in this Court then has to be that it was irrational for the Tribunal to decide that the appellant had lied without, at that earlier stage, weighing the alleged corroborative evidence by the witness in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">That may be a preferable method of going about the task presented by s 430 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">But it is not irrational to focus first upon the case as it was put by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In this case, the Tribunal comprehensively examined the primary case first put by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Tribunal considered the evidence of the witnesses called by the appellant and reached the conclusions already identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Tribunal did not simply ignore the evidence in the sense contemplated in Minister for Immigration v Yusuf (supra).</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The point of principle referred to in the reasoning of the Chief Justice in Applicant S20/2002 remains determinative, whether the particular evidence is a document or a statutory declaration or embraces oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The appellant says that SZIEW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 101 ALD 295 per Madgwick J is authority for the proposition that a failure by the Tribunal to accord separate deliberative reasons for the rejection of the evidence of each witness is a failure to exercise jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In that case, Madgwick J concluded that the Tribunal wrongly accorded the evidence of a witness "little weight" for the sole reason that the Tribunal had no opportunity to test the claims made by a witness that her relative had been captured and had heard certain things about the particular applicant's husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The case also concerned events in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Having regard to the inquisitorial role of the Tribunal and its statutory function, the rejection of the evidence of a witness as to the statements made to the witness by her relative, on the sole ground identified by the Tribunal, reflected error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">In this case, the Tribunal elected to accord the evidence of the witnesses called in support of the appellant's evidence, little weight, having duly considered the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It did so on the footing that the evidence did not assist the Tribunal in resolving its concerns about the reliability and creditworthiness of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That conclusion was open to the Tribunal on the evidence and the treatment of the evidence is consistent with the principles established in Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs is a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
