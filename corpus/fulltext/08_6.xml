 HIS HONOUR 
 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") adverse to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Background 
 
2 The appellant is a national of Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He comes from a tribal area on the North West frontier near Afghanistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In February 2001 he arrived in Australia after deserting ship and his long employment as a seaman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">His subsequent history of visa applications, and the procedural history of this matter, is unusual and requires explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 On 28 May 2001 an application for protection was lodged with the first respondent's department ("the Department") in the name of Akhtar Mohammed Waisi, a person claiming to be an Afghan national.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A migration agent lodged this application purportedly on the applicant's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The application for a protection visa was rejected by a delegate of the Minister on 12 June 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 On 30 January 2003 the appellant personally lodged an application for a protection (class XA) visa in his own name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 10 June 2003 the Department advised the appellant that pursuant to s 48A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") he was prevented from making such application because he had made a previous application under a different name which had been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 An application to the Tribunal for review of that "decision" was rejected on 9 October 2003 on the basis that there had been no reviewable decision and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant unsuccessfully sought judicial review of this decision: NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 160 ; NAWZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused on 7 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 However on 14 December 2005 the then Minister exercised her power under s 48B of the Act in favour of the appellant, so that he was no longer precluded from making a further application for a protection visa, notwithstanding s 48A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 The appellant then lodged an application for a protection (class XA) visa on 3 January 2006, on the basis that he and his family had been harassed and threatened in Pakistan as a result of his father's political activities and membership of the Pakistan People's Party ("PPP").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant also claimed to fear a tribal revenge killing because his father had allegedly killed the elder son of a local leader of the political group Jamaat-e-Islami ("JI").</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">A delegate of the Minister refused the application for a protection visa and, on 24 January 2006 the appellant, through his legal representatives, lodged an application for review with the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 On 1 March 2006 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant through his adviser in the following terms:
 
 With your first application to the Refugee review tribunal in July 2003, you submitted a document headed "Background" in which you explained the reasons for which you were applying for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">You stated that you had twice telephoned your family from Sydney and, on the second occasion, you were told that you should not return, as you would be in danger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal has reliable information that, two days prior to your arrival in Sydney, you had changed $US5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This information is relevant because this information may lead the Tribunal to conclude that your departure from your ship was planned prior to your conversation with your family and your decision to remain in Australia was taken for reasons other than fear of persecution in Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">

9 An email was received by the Department from a shipping agent on 21 February 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This email was the source of the Tribunal's indication that it "had reliable information" that the appellant had changed US$5000 two days prior to his arrival in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The email assumed a central importance in the Tribunal's credibility findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It says that the Staff Captain had "advised that they have found that he [an unnamed person who had jumped ship] changed USD5000 into Australian currency two days prior to arriving in Sydney" and that a crew member who was on leave had given the absconder his name and address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">10 The copy of the email provided by the Tribunal to the appellant, after a request from his agent, was incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It was missing the name and address of the crew member on leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">11 The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa on 2 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason if he were to return to Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal did not accept the bulk of the appellant's claim and found him to be "a person without credibility".</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In the course of his reasons the Tribunal Member said
 
 Two other medical certificates were submitted, from two different doctors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">One relates to the death of the applicant's mother and the other to a recent injury to his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I do not accept that either is authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Although they are on the face of it from two different doctors, the handwriting is identical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The wording of the certificate regarding his mother is very similar to that regarding his father and states that his mother suffered head and face injuries in a grenade blast, which caused her death about 7 months later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Again there are no dates and none of the medical details I would expect in such a certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

12 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This application was dismissed by Lloyd-Jones FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Appellant's submissions 
 
13 The appellant submitted that the reasoning of the learned Federal Magistrate was in error in a number of respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In particular, the appellant submitted that his Honour erred by not finding that the Tribunal had failed to meet the requirements of s 424A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The grounds of alleged error fall into four categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">(i) The 2003 Tribunal statement 
 
14 The first issue was whether the Tribunal ought to have provided the appellant with a copy of the document titled "Background", submitted by the appellant as part of his 2003 application and referred to in the letter of 1 March 2006 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Critical findings as to credit were drawn from this document in conjunction with the email from a shipping agent to the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">15 The appellant submitted that the letter to him from the Tribunal dated 1 March 2006 did not discharge the Tribunal's obligation under s 424A to provide him with "particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The appellant asserts that he was not given a direct extract of the relevant portions of the 2003 Tribunal application, nor any clue as to the context in which the alleged statements were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 The appellant submitted that, in order to deal with the accusation made by the Tribunal in the 1 March letter, the appellant would need to know the context and exact statements alleged to have been made by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The appellant further submitted that the 1 March letter did not discharge the Tribunal's s 424A duties because he was not given the information itself (rather a conclusion about what the information meant) and was not given the necessary particulars to allow him to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">(ii) The blacked out email 
 
17 The appellant submitted that it was clear that the email was read as a whole by the Tribunal as information leading to the view that the appellant had previously planned to jump ship, and that his being told the name and address of the person in the email was critical to allowing a fair response to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Enquiries might have been made of that person as to whether the appellant was in fact the deserting crew member spoken of in the email, amongst other things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">18 The learned Federal Magistrate rejected this ground on the basis that the appellant could "respond to the factual allegation by confirming, denying or explaining away the allegation"; that the supply of the email was sufficient; and that the question of changing money was the information for which the Tribunal sought explanation from the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">19 The appellant submitted that, by selectively providing the information in the email, the Tribunal failed to ensure that the appellant was, in words taken from Paul v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 429, "fairly informed of information adverse to his or her case ... so that investigation may be made, and steps may be taken, somehow, if possible, to meet it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">"
 (iii) Other s 424A grounds 
 
20 As to the Tribunal's rejection of the genuineness of the two medical reports purportedly made by two different doctors, submissions were made to the Federal Magistrate by the appellant regarding a supposed failure to comply with s 424A on the basis that the information used by the Tribunal was not simply each of the two documents compared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The conclusion drawn from those documents, that the handwriting was identical, was the information which must be given to the appellant by virtue of s 424A(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">His Honour rejected those submissions on the bases that either the "information" referred to was merely the Tribunal's thought processes rather than information, or because the information had been provided to the Tribunal by the appellant himself and so was excluded by operation of s 424A(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">(iv) The application of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act 
 
21 The appellant submitted that the Federal Magistrate erred in his application of s 424A(3)(b) in relation to the medical certificates created by third parties and provided to the Tribunal by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">22 The appellant also alleged a further error in the application of s 424A(3)(b) on the basis that a submission given to the Tribunal by the appellant's agent was said to have adopted earlier material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Such adoption was held to apply to the statutory declaration that the appellant made for the purposes of the protection visa application, and all other documents provided by his advisors, together with the protection visa application and the application for review to the first Tribunal in 2003, including the document headed "Background".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The foundation for holding that this material was information given by the applicant for the purposes of the review at hand was a statement by the appellant's agent in closing written submissions following the 2006 Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The agent said 
 
 [the appellant's] claims are set out in detail in the statutory declaration provided with his application to the Department of Immigration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">A submission provided with this application contains additional information relating to his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">[The appellant] continues to rely on these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

23 The appellant submitted that this statement only applied to the statutory declaration and not to the contents of the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He further submitted that it could not be taken to refer to the material which was provided during the course of the previous Tribunal matter, such as the document titled "Background".</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The appellant submitted that the general rule in this area is that, as Jacobson J said in NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 357, s 424A(3)(b) may operate where there has been an express adoption of the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Here, it was submitted, the only express written reference was to the statutory declaration attached to the protection visa application and perhaps, on a generous reading, the submissions in support of the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The appellant submitted that the Federal Magistrate therefore erred by applying s 424A(3)(b) to material other than the statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Respondent's submissions 
 Alleged breach of s 424A regarding post-hearing information 
 
24 The respondent submitted that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate's analysis of the treatment of the documents forwarded to the Tribunal by the appellant's lawyers (including the document titled "Background").</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">If those acting on behalf of an applicant send documents to the Tribunal, then the applicant has "given" the information for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">25 The respondent further submitted that any negative inference that the Tribunal may have drawn from information supplied by the appellant after the Tribunal hearing could not be considered "information" for the purposes of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Information in this context is "knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to, or received by, the Tribunal": SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [205] , and not "the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations": SZEEU 150 FCR at [206].</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Breach of s 424A regarding various items of "information" 
 
 (i) The document titled "Background" 
 
26 The respondent submitted that the appellant had overstated the duty imposed on the Tribunal by s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In NATL v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 112 , the Full Court held at [14] that "[t]he section does not require the provision of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test is whether an applicant is fairly informed of the information considered to be adverse: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">) The respondent also relied on comments of Heerey and Allsop JJ in Paul [2001] FCA 1196 ; 113 FCR 396.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Tribunal' s 1 March 2006 letter clearly identified the information that the Tribunal considered would be, subject to the appellant's response, a reason for affirming the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The factual proposition referred to in the letter was clear: the Tribunal had received information that the appellant had changed money prior to his arrival in Sydney, whereas the appellant had stated that he learned of a danger in Pakistan from his family by telephone after he arrived in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">According to the respondent, the letter also explained the relevance of the information: that the changing of money prior to his arrival suggested that the appellant planned to stay in Sydney before he spoke with his family and it was therefore not true that he decided to stay in Sydney due to fears arising from his conversations with his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">27 The respondent submitted that the particulars provided by the Tribunal were adequate to allow the appellant to respond effectively to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Further, the appellant was supplied with a copy of the email which was the source of the information regarding his having changed money prior to arrival in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The respondent submitted that there was no obligation to provide the actual "Background" document referred to in the 1 March letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">28 
 
The information contained therein bore on the alleged timing of the appellant's being told of the risks he faced in Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">How the Tribunal derived this information was inconsequential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">(ii) Failure to provide an unedited copy of the email 
 
29 The respondent submitted that there was no breach of s 424A by the Tribunal in supplying a copy of the email referred to above to the appellant with some information blacked out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Consistently with s 424A the appellant was given adequate particulars of the relevant aspects of the information that the Tribunal considered could be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">(iii) Section 424A(3)(b) exemptions 
 
30 The respondent accepted that the reference to "application" in section 424A(3)(b) means the application for review that is under consideration by the Tribunal: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 at [17] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">However, the respondent submitted that information which has previously been given for some other purpose, such as the original visa application, can become information given by the applicant for the purpose of the Tribunal application if the applicant expressly adopts that information as part of the application for review to the Tribunal: M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] ; NBHH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1198 at [12] - [13] ; VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [10] - [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In its reasons for decision the Tribunal referred to a statutory declaration, and accompanying submission, by the appellant that he had submitted with his primary visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The appellant's advisor had expressly adopted these earlier documents for the purposes of the application for review to the Tribunal in the submission received by the Tribunal on 7 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It followed that the information contained therein had been adopted and become information which the appellant "gave for the purpose of the application" for review and so fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 (iv) Failure to provide written notice of the Tribunal's view that documents provided by the appellant would be given no weight 

31 The respondent submitted that this ground of appeal must fail because it proceeds on the false premise that the Tribunal's view about the authenticity of documents was "information" to which s 424A applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">32 In the respondent's submission, the Tribunal's view about the authenticity of documents provided by the appellant is not knowledge of a fact or circumstance "communicated to, or received by, the Tribunal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Rather, it was an aspect of the Tribunal's subjective appraisal of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There is no requirement in s 424A that the Tribunal give the appellant written notice of such appraisals: SZEEU 150 FCR at [205]-[206].</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">33 In any case, the documents themselves were given by the appellant for the purpose of the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As such they fall within the s 424A(3)(b) exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Consideration 
 
34 No point was taken in reliance on s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">With respect to all matters raised in this appeal I agree with the submissions of counsel for the respondent and, generally, with the reasons of the court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">35 The decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609, handed down between the hearing of this matter and the publication of these reasons, confirms the arguments of the respondents with respect to the medical certificates that the Tribunal considered had been forged and the application of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In that case, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan examined the operation of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Their Honours held at [18] that
 
 if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">

36 The inconsistencies referred to by their Honours in that case were those which existed between statutory declarations made by the appellants and oral evidence given at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Their Honours went on to say:
 
 [h]owever broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">

37 These comments would appear to be fatal to the arguments of the appellant in this case with respect to the medical certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The conclusion that the medical certificates may have been forged cannot be "information" for the purposes of s 424A , rather the medical certificates themselves and the handwriting are the "information".</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">That the handwriting in the two reports appeared identical was, in the language of Allsop J in SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2 ; 150 FCR 214, a "subjective appraisal" by the Tribunal leading, with other matters also appraised, to a "determination" that the reports were not "authentic".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">38 For these reasons, all aspects of the appellant's appeal must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The appeal is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Associate:
