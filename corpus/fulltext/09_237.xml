 The background to this case is described in an interlocutory judgement which I delivered on 12 December 2008 in respect of an application by Burnett Water for a stay of the proceedings: Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1900.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">That application was unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The case concerns a dam on the Burnett River known as the Paradise Dam the construction and operation of which, subject to conditions, was approved by a Commonwealth Minister under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Differences have emerged between the parties with respect to a number of issues of practice and procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Burnett Water has sought the following orders: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That by 10 April 2009 the Applicant file and serve:
 
(a) the further and better particulars requested in the Respondent's solicitors' letter dated 24 February 2009;
 
(b) a statement of the design of the fish transfer device which, by the grant of the injunction sought in paragraph 2 of the Application, the Respondent would be compelled to install and operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Alternatively to paragraph 1(b) above, that:
 
(a) the claim for relief in paragraph 2 of the Application be struck out; and
 
(b) the Applicant have leave to file and serve by 10 April 2009 an Amended Application including a claim for a mandatory injunction, such leave being conditional upon the Amended Application including, or incorporating by reference, a statement of the design of the fish transfer device which, by the grant of the injunction, the Respondent would be compelled to install and operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Such further or other order as the Court deems fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">That the Applicant pay the Respondent's costs of and incidental to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">For its part and aside from directions concerning expert and other evidence, the Conservation Council has sought the following orders: The Respondent provide discovery of the following classes of documents in its possession, custody or power: 
(a) water quality data, reports or records relevant to any fish kills or poor water quality potentially affecting attractant flows to the downstream or upstream fishways;
 
(b) reports or records on the collapse or malfunction of the main water inlet/outlet works of the dam affecting water releases from the dam to the extent that these may affect attractant flows to the upstream or downstream fishways; and
 
(c) reports or records of any fish kills in the Paradise Dam reservoir or beneath the dam wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Discovery of the documents in paragraph 1 be given by serving the Applicant by Tuesday 24 March 2009 with:

 Particulars 
 In Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664 Murphy, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ jointly observed: 
 Pleadings and particulars have a number of functions: they furnish a statement of the case sufficiently clear to allow the other party a fair opportunity to meet it ( Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v. Mount Oxide Mines Ltd. (In liq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">) [1916] HCA 81 ; (1916) 22 CLR 490 , at p 517; they define the issues for decision in the litigation and thereby enable the relevance and admissibility of evidence to be determined at the trial ( Miller v. Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572 , at pp 576-577; and they give a defendant an understanding of a plaintiff's claim in aid of the defendant's right to make a payment into court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Apart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issues chosen at the trial, the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings ( Gould and Birbeck and Bacon (1916) 22 CLR, at pp 517, 518 ; Sri Mahant Govind Rao v. Sita Ram Kesho (1898) LR 25 Ind App 195, at p 207 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">But where there is no departure during the trial from the pleaded cause of action, a disconformity between the evidence and particulars earlier furnished will not disentitle a party to a verdict based upon the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Particulars may be amended after the evidence in a trial has closed ( Mummery v. Irvings Pty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Ltd. [1956] HCA 45 ; (1956) 96 CLR 99 , at pp 111, 112, 127), though a failure to amend particulars to accord precisely with the facts which have emerged in the course of evidence does not necessarily preclude a plaintiff from seeking a verdict on the cause of action alleged in reliance upon the facts actually established by the evidence ( Leotta v. Public Transport Commission (N.S.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">) (1976) 9 ALR 437 , at p 446; 50 ALJR 666 , at p 668).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">

 Burnett Water is concerned not to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on the issues so identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">To that end, in November last year it requested the Conservation Council to furnish particulars of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Conservation Council answered that request but not in a way which Burnett Water submits was sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That the Court has power to order the furnishing of further and better particulars of a statement of claim is not in doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Order 12 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules confers such power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The question is whether in the circumstances that power should be exercised or whether Burnett Water has sought to play what was memorably described in the 12 th (1975) Edition of Bullen &amp; Leake and Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings (at 113-114) as "the particulars game"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The observations then made by the learned authors concerning particulars and that "game" remain true today: 
 The tendency of modern practice is to give full particulars as may be necessary of the matters pleaded, and to respond to a request for further and better particulars of pleading more fully than heretofore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">There is a growing understanding among practitioners that giving the necessary particulars of pleading not only helps in preparing a case and in stating it with certainty and confidence but also manifests the strength of a party's case, while withholding particulars suggests a possible weakness in the case and a desire to spring surprise as to the oral evidence at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On the other hand, practitioners are also aware, from their knowledge and experience, that particulars of pleadings beyond those that are really necessary may fetter the hands of a party too closely, or lay on him an increased burden of proof, or may disclose more than is tactically wise of his case at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Hence there quite often develops a struggle, which goes under the popular title of the "particulars game," under which one party seeks to compel the opposite party to reveal more fully the case which he has pleaded and to tie him down to narrower issues, whereas the opposite party seeks to keep the issues as wide and as general as possible and to withhold as much of his own case as he can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">[Footnote references omitted] 

 One riposte which the Conservation Council made to the application for an order for the provision of further and better particulars was the submission that no order should be made because Burnett Water had filed a defence and pleadings had closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">There is no merit in this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A party can be ordered to furnish particulars or further and better particulars at any stage of a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Pleadings indeed have closed, at least for the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Discovery and inspection have taken place in respect of particular classes of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Trial dates have been fixed, but the trial does not commence until 7 September 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It is axiomatic that, in preparing further for that trial, including preparing and filing such affidavit evidence as it may be advised, Burnett Water know the case it has to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">If that presently requires the furnishing of further and better particulars then there is nothing oppressive about an order requiring the Conservation Council to do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">To put the particulars contest in context, it is necessary to set out exactly what was approved in, and condition 3 of, the Ministerial approval under the EPBC Act, as varied, para 2 of the claim for relief in the application and some excerpts from the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Condition 3 provides: 
 [Burnett Water] must install a fish transfer device on the Burnett River Dam suitable for lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The fishway will commence when the dam becomes operational.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
 The Ministerially approved "action" (as to the statutory concept of which, more later) which was subject, materially, to this condition was: 

 
 to construct and operate the Burnett River Dam with a capacity of 300,000 megalitres, on the lower Burnett River at 132km Average Middle Thread Distance (AMTD), and make controlled discharges of water for agricultural, commercial, domestic and environmental uses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

 Paragraph 2 of the orders sought by the Conservation Council in its application is in these terms: 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A mandatory injunction that, within 6 months of the date of this order, [Burnett Water] comply with condition 3 of the approval for the Paradise Dam granted under the EPBC Act by installing and operating continuously until 1 January 2052 a fish transfer device that is likely to allow any normal sized Australian lungfish ( Neoceratodus fosteri ) to move upstream and downstream of the dam without injury irrespective of the water level in the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">

 Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the statement of claim make the following allegations: The respondent has engaged, engages and, unless restrained by the Court, proposes to engage in conduct consisting of an act or omission that constitutes an offence or other contravention of the EPBC Act by failing since the dam became operational to install and operate a fish transfer device suitable for lungfish in contravention of condition 3 of the approval for the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 Particulars of conduct constituting an offence or other contravention 
 
 
The respondent has installed and operated, is operating, and intends to continue to operate the upstream fishway and downstream fishway in a manner whereby:
 
 
(a) The entrances to the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not likely to be found by lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream or downstream of the dam wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">(b) The entrances to the upstream fishway and downstream fishway are too small for fully grown lungfish to enter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">(c) The caged container in the upstream fishway is too small for fully grown lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">(d) The upstream fishway and downstream fishway do not operate continuously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(e) The downstream fishway is not suitable for lungfish to move or migrate downstream of the dam when water levels in the dam are beneath EL 62.0 m (57% of the full storage capacity of the dam) because the inlet to the downstream fishway is constructed above this height.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">(f) Lungfish are likely to be injured by the speed at which they are transported through the downstream fishway and the small dimensions of the pipes and downstream release pool.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">(g) Lungfish, particularly juveniles, are susceptible to predation while moving through the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">(h) Lungfish exiting the upstream fishway or the downstream fishway are susceptible to predation at the release point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">(i) Due to the matters raised in paragraphs 6(a)-(h), the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not likely (more than 50% probable) to allow any normal sized lungfish to move upstream and downstream of the dam without injury irrespective of the water level in the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The respondent's contravention of condition 3 set out in paragraph 6 constitutes an offence or other contravention of sections 142 and 142B of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The respondent's contravention of condition 3 set out in paragraph 6 constitutes an offence or other contravention of section 142A of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 Particulars of offence against section 142A 
 
 
(a) The respondent has been reckless as to the contravention; and
 
(b) The respondent's conduct results, will result in, or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter protected by a provision of Part 3 of the EPBC Act, namely the lungfish, a listed threatened species by:
 
(i) Stopping, hindering, or reducing upstream and downstream movement or migration of lungfish in the Burnett River for feeding or reproduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">(ii) Causing a greater number of lungfish to move downstream in flood events over the dam spillway and, thereby, increasing mortality in the lungfish population due to death or injury of lungfish on the spillway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">(iii) Unless restrained by the Court the impacts in paragraphs 8(b)(i) and (ii) will continue during the operation of the dam for the indefinite future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In its filed defence Burnett Water, materially: 
(a) admits that the downstream fishway:
 
(i) does not transfer lungfish when water levels in the dam are beneath 62.0 metres (being a level estimated to be achieved approximately 80% of the time) because the designed minimum operating level of the downstream fishway is EL 62.0;
 
(ii) has not transferred lungfish because, due to drought conditions, water levels in the dam have not reached 62.0 metres;
 
(iii) otherwise denies the allegations in paragraph 6 of the statement of claim;
 
(b) denies the allegations made in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the statement of claim; and
 
(c) further or alternatively, alleges that it has acted honestly and reasonably at all times and not at any time acted recklessly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The particulars furnished in November last year by the Conservation Council in respect of para 6 and para 8 of the statement of claim were, to say the least, lengthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is though desirable, having regard to the way in which I have decided to dispose of the application, to set out those particulars in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 Paragraph 6 

 
 3 Insofar as it is alleged that: 

 
 "(a) The entrances to the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not likely to be found by lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream or downstream of the dam wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" 

 
 (a) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the entrance to the upstream fishway is not likely to be found by lungfish are:
 (i) The entrance to the upstream fishway is comprised of a single vertical slot located near the base of the Paradise Dam having a width of approximately 0.2 --- 0.4 m and a height of several meters, part of which is submerged in the river channel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">(ii) A relatively small volume of water is intermittently released by the respondent through the upstream fishway for the purpose of attracting lungfish to enter it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">(iii) A larger volume of water is also intermittently released by the respondent adjacent to the upstream fishway from the Paradise Dam outlet works for the purpose of releasing water downstream from the dam and this water attracts lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream away from the entrance to the upstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">(iv) The applicant accepts that some lungfish will locate and enter the upstream fishway but having regard to the physical characteristics of its entrance, the presence of a larger attractant flow from the outlet works, its intermittent operation, and the behaviour of the lungfish, it is not likely (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">more than 50% probable) that lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream will locate the entrance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">(b) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the entrance to the downstream fishway is not likely to be found by lungfish are:
 (i) The entrance to the downstream fishway is comprised of a single vertical slot located on a vertically orientated concrete chamber attached to the dam's intake tower on the upstream side of the dam wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">(ii) The entrance to the downstream fishway is approximately 0.2 --- 0.4 m wide and 5.9 m high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">(iii) The entrance to the downstream fishway is very small in comparison to the dam wall and there is little to channel or direct lungfish attempting to move or migrate downstream towards it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The dam wall is comprised of a 285 m wide spillway and an additional wall area totalling approximately 400 m. This is extremely large in comparison to the entrance to the downstream fishway of 0.2 --- 0.4 m.
 (iv) The entrance to the downstream fishway is fitted with a sliding gate able to raise the minimum height at which water can enter the chamber of the downstream fishway from 62 m elevation (EL) to 67.9 m EL representing, respectively, water levels equivalent to 57% and slightly above 100% of the capacity of the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">(v) The downstream fishway is not able to operate beneath water levels less than 62.5 m EL to allow 0.5 m of water to flow into the entrance sufficient for lungfish to enter it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">(vi) Since the commencement of the operation of the dam and to the time of filing these further and better particulars, water levels in the dam have not been sufficient to enable the downstream fishway to operate and lungfish would be required to jump out of the water to locate the entrance (a behaviour the species is not known to exhibit).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">(vii) When water levels exceed 62.5 m EL, the downstream fishway is intended to be operated intermittently by lowering the sliding gate at its entrance to allow water to enter it and thereby attract lungfish into it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">(viii) The water flow into the downstream fishway will be, at best, very small in comparison to the area of the dam wall and the larger volume of water entering the main water outlet for the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The dam wall is approximately 400 m wide by 37 m high which is much larger than the approximate 0.2 --- 0.4 m wide and 0.5 m high flow of water into the downstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In addition, the inflow into the downstream fishway occurs only at the top of the water column and adjacent to the much larger intermittent flow into the main dam water outlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">(ix) The intermittent release of water from the main water outlet of the dam will attract lungfish attempting to move or migrate downstream away from the entrance to the downstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">(x) The applicant accepts that some lungfish may locate and enter the downstream fishway if water levels in the future are sufficient to allow it to be operated but having regard to the characteristics of the entrance to the downstream fishway stated in previous paragraphs, its extremely intermittent and unreliable operation, and the behaviour of the lungfish, it is not likely (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">more than 50% probable) that lungfish attempting to move or migrate downstream will locate the entrance to the downstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">

 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Insofar as it is alleged that: 

 
 "(b) The entrances to the upstream fishway and downstream fishway are too small for fully grown lungfish to enter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">" 

 
 (a) Lungfish may grow to approximately 2 m in length, 0.3 m in width, and weigh up to 48 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In the Burnett River the mean length of adult lungfish is approximately 0.9 m and their mean weight is approximately 8 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">(b) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the entrances to the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are too small for fully grown lungfish to enter are:
 (i) The sizes of the entrances to the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway particularised above in paragraphs 3(a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">(ii) The size of fully grown lungfish particularised above in 4(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">(iii) The water heights at which the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are operated or intended to be operated, including the intended provision of 0.5 m of water flow into the downstream fishway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">(iv) The behaviour of lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream or downstream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">(c) The respondent's request to "identify the size that is alleged the entrance to the upstream fishway is required to be for fully grown lungfish to enter" misunderstands the case the applicant is required to prove.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The applicant alleges that the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not "suitable for lungfish" within the meaning of condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The respondent is responsible for installing and operating a fish transfer device that complies with this condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The applicant is not required to prove, and does not allege, that any fish transfer device is "suitable for lungfish" within the meaning of condition 3 of the EPBC Act approval for the dam.</sentence>

 (a) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the caged container in the upstream fishway is too small for fully grown lungfish include:
 (i) The caged container used in the upstream fishway is approximately 7,500 litres in volume and measures approximately 4 m in length, 2 m in width, and 2 m in height.</sentence>

 (a) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the upstream fishway does not operate continuously include:
 (i) The upstream fishway is frequently and for extended periods not operated by the respondent.</sentence>

<sentence id="s109">(iii) The caged container installed in the upstream fishway is not operated continuously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">(iv) During the periods when the attractant flows are released from the upstream fishway and the caged container is operated, there are extended periods when the caged container is lifted over the dam wall when lungfish cannot move through the fishway and it is, therefore, not "suitable for lungfish" within the meaning of condition 3 of the approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Condition 3 requires the fish transfer device to be "suitable for lungfish" to pass through it at all times and the operation of the upstream fishway does not satisfy this requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">(b) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the downstream fishway does not operate continuously include:
 (i) The downstream fishway is constructed such that water levels in the dam must reach the base of the entrance of the fishway at 62 m EL and rise an addition 0.5 m before the downstream fishway can operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">(ii) Water levels have not reached 62.5 m EL and the fishway has not operated since the commencement of the operation of the dam in November 2005 and the filing of these further and better particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">(iii) Even in future periods when water levels in the dam are above 62.5 m EL, the respondent intends to operate the downstream fishway only intermittently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">(iv) During future periods when water levels in the dam are above 62.5 m EL and attractant flows are allowed to enter the downstream fishway and the fishway is operated, there are extended periods when the attractant flows will cease and the slide gates at the entrance to the fishway will be raised to allow the trap chamber in the fishway to be flushed and any fish within it released beneath the dam.</sentence>

 (a) The respondent is alleged to have contravened subsection 142A(1) of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">(b) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the respondent's alleged contravention of condition 3 has been reckless include:
 (i) The allegation of recklessness relates primarily to paragraphs 6(d) and (e) of the Statement of Claim, the facts that the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway do not operate continuously and that the downstream fishway was designed to only operate above 62 m EL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">(ii) Prior to the construction of the dam and since its commencement the respondent has intended to operate the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway intermittently depending on water availability and operational demands in contravention of condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">(iii) At no time did the respondent intend to operate the upstream fishway or the downstream fishway continuously as required by condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">(iv) Prior to the construction of the dam and since its commencement the respondent has known it would operate the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway intermittently depending on water availability and operational demands in contravention of condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">(v) Since the commencement of the dam in November 2005 the respondent has known it was not operating the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway continuously and, therefore was in contravention of condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">(vi) In planning the construction and operation of the dam and prior to the commencement of the dam in November 2005 the respondent knew that water levels would vary and would at times be beneath 62 m EL, thereby not allowing the downstream fishway to operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The respondent designed the main water outlet works of the dam in such a way as to allow release of water while storage levels are low, including allowing environmental flows to be maintained during dry periods that the respondent knew may occur during normal operation but failed to design the downstream fishway to operate in such conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">(vii) At least since the Compliance Audit conducted by the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Water Resources in mid-2007, the respondent has known that the design and operation of the downstream fishway contravened condition 3 of the approval because water levels had not reached the operating height of 62 m EL and the condition required continuous operation from the commencement of the dam in November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">(viii) In relation to design of the downstream fishway such that the entrance required water in the dam to reach 62 m EL (and an additional 0.5 m of water) for the fishway to operate, prior to constructing the dam:
 (A) the respondent was aware of a substantial risk that water would not reach that level for a considerable period after the commencement of the dam due to the highly variable rainfall in the Burnett River Catchment; and
 (B) having regard to the circumstances known to the respondent, it was unjustifiable to construct the downstream fishway in such a manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">(ix) The allegation of recklessness relates to the respondent's conduct and no individual person within the respondent is alleged to have been reckless on behalf of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">(c) It is not alleged that the respondent has been reckless as to the fact that the alleged contravention is likely to have a significant impact on the lungfish (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">a contravention of subsection 142A(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">(d) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the respondent's conduct:
 (i) In fact results in each of the impacts in paragraph 8(b)(i) and (ii) are as follows (noting that a "significant impact" is an impact that is important, notable or of consequence having regard to its context or intensity, and the context or intensity of the impacts caused by the respondent's conduct includes the following facts):
 (A) The lungfish species' known distribution, populations, life history, habitat requirements, migratory behaviour and migratory requirements, including the facts that:
 (I) Lungfish undertake limited migrations of varying length both during the normal course of activities but more critically for breeding purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">(II) Lungfish migrate up to 45 km and the longer migrations appear to be associated with movement upstream out of impoundments to suitable spawning habitats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">(III) Adult lungfish home ranges (the area of river where most time is spent) are relatively small (usually less than 5 --- 10 km) and long migratory passages are therefore not critical for adult individuals to survive but are significant for breeding and maintaining genetic variability and viability in the population in the Burnett River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">(B) The known behaviour of the lungfish relevant to design of fish passage through the Paradise Dam, including the fact that lungfish are known to move downstream in high-flow (flood) events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">(C) During flood events and at other times when the dam spillway operates lungfish are likely to attempt to move or migrate downstream over the spillway thereby increasing mortality in the lungfish population due to the death or injury of lungfish falling approximately 37 m in highly turbulent and fast flowing water down the large concrete steps constructed in the spillway to dissipate water velocity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">(D) The demographic variables that affect the natural movement or migration of lungfish, including age, sex, and size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">(E) Variations in the movement or migration of lungfish with seasons, river flow and other naturally variable factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">(F) The evolutionary and ecological significance of the lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">(G) Why the lungfish has been listed as vulnerable to extinction under the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">(H) The importance of connectivity in the lungfish population in the Burnett River and, in particular, the need for effective fish passage upstream or downstream on the Paradise Dam to provide breeding and feeding opportunities and to maintain the genetic variability and viability of the lungfish population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">(I) The impacts that would be expected on lungfish population in the Burnett River from the construction of the Paradise Dam without a fish transfer device, such as changes in habitat and changes in the genetic variability and viability of the lungfish population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">(J) Other than the Paradise Dam, the threats and impacts faced by the lungfish population in the Burnett River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">(K) Other threats and impacts faced by the lungfish species outside the population in the Burnett River, including the proposed construction of the Traveston Crossing Dam on the Mary River using a fish transfer device modelled on the Paradise Dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">(L) The water flow regime, particularly periods of zero flow, at the site of the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway prior to the construction of the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">(M) The extent that water levels in the dam in the future will obtain and remain above 62m AHD (57% of the dam capacity), thereby allowing the downstream fishway as currently constructed to operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">(N) The likelihood that the upstream fishway design will allow safe lungfish passage in comparison to unrestricted passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">(O) The likelihood that the upstream fishway will allow safe lungfish passage as actually operated by the respondent in comparison to unrestricted passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">(P) The likelihood that the downstream fishway design will allow safe lungfish passage in comparison to unrestricted passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">(Q) The likelihood that the downstream fishway will allow safe lungfish passage as actually operated by the respondent in comparison to unrestricted passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">(R) Restrictions in movement or migration of lungfish in the Burnett River caused by the design and operation of the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway causing changes in the genetic variability and viability of the lungfish population and the consequences of these impacts for the conservation of the lungfish species.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">(ii) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the respondent's conduct will result in each of the impacts in paragraph 8(b)(i) and (ii), are the matters set out in paragraph 12(d)(i) of these Further and Better Particulars and noting that "will result" refers to future impacts that are more probable than not (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">more than a 50% chance).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">(iii) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the respondent's conduct is likely to result in each of the impacts in paragraph 8(b)(i) and (ii), are the matters set out in paragraph 12(d)(i) of these Further and Better Particulars and noting that "is likely to result" refers to future impacts the occurrence of which is a real chance or possibility regardless of whether or not it is more or less than 50% probable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">(e) The facts, matters, and circumstances relied upon in support of the allegation that the impacts in paragraph 8(b)(i) and (ii) will continue for the indefinite future unless the respondent is restrained include:
 (i) The past and present conduct of the respondent, including:
 (A) the respondent's response to the Compliance Audit conducted by the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Water Resources in mid-2007; and 
 (B) the respondent's response to these proceedings in the Court, indicates that the respondent intends to continue to operate the dam in contravention of condition 3 of the approval and causing the impacts alleged in paragraph 8(b)(i) and (ii) for the indefinite future unless restrained by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">(ii) The respondent intends that the nominal engineering design life of the Paradise Dam is 50 years, though the respondent expects that it is likely to be maintained after that period provided that it continues to meet dam safety requirements and remains an integral part of the regional water supply strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">(iii) The respondent intends that the dam will remain operational after its nominal engineering design life of 50 years but may be decommissioned during or after the initial engineering design life if:
 (A) it suffers significant damage that cannot be remedied to meet safety standards; or
 (B) it is no longer needed to provide water within the Burnett Region.</sentence>

 Having regard to the terms of [s 142A(1)], your client is obliged to: 

 
 (a) particularise with precision each action and omission relied upon including, without limitation, by:

 (I) identify the respects in which the action or omission contravened the condition attached to the approval; 

 
 (II) state each fact relied upon to allege that the respondent was reckless as to the fact that the action or omission contravened the condition attached to the approval including, without limitation, by identifying: 

 the individual or individuals by whom the respondent is alleged to have been reckless; The facts alleged to have been known by the respondent (and each individual identified in response to subparagraph (b)(II)A above) at the time the action was or ought to have been taken; any facts from which the knowledge referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii)B above is claimed to be an inference;
 
 (III) specify each fact relied upon to establish the casual link between the action or omission and the impact identified in the particulars of paragraph 8 of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">

 
 Your client's particulars of 19 November 2008 fall a long way short of meeting these obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Indeed, they exhibit a number of inadequacies which place our client in an impossible position in attempting to answer the serious allegations your client has chosen to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">For example: 

 
 (a) In subparagraph 12(b) they are expressed in inclusive terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">And in subparagraph 12(b)(I) the allegations of recklessness are said to relate "primarily" to paragraphs 6(d) and (e) of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Thus our client is faced with an avowedly incomplete statement of the case against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This is manifestly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Our client is entitled to a complete statement of all of the particulars of the serious charges levelled against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">

 
 (b) They are replete with allegations of intention and knowledge, yet they fail to identify who on behalf of the respondent had the alleged intention or knowledge, and they fail to identify any facts from which that intention or knowledge is claimed to be an inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">In the context of an allegation of recklessness, this is again manifestly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Your client cannot seek refuge in the statement that "no individual person within the respondent is alleged to have been reckless".</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The respondent is a corporation which can only act through human agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Our client is entitled to know which individuals are alleged to have been reckless, and the respects in which they are alleged to have been reckless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Without being apprised of these essential particulars, our client will be prejudiced in the preparation of its defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">

 Apart from stating that the "action" of Burnett Water that was alleged to contravene condition 3 was "the design, installation and operation of the fish transfer device", the Conservation Council's response of 25 February 2009 offered no further particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In the course of oral argument, the Conservation Council mollified its position somewhat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Of the particulars furnished under para 8 of the statement of claim in November 2008, it was conceded that the inexactitude introduced by the words "includes" in para 10(b) and "primarily" in para 10(b)(i) was not defensible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It is to be lamented that such self critical insight did not earlier manifest itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">It inevitably follows that, wherever the word "include" and its derivatives have been used in the particulars furnished in November 2008, they are, to that extent, embarrassingly imprecise, for all their length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It was further rightly conceded by the Conservation Council in oral submissions that, irrespective of whatever else it might be ordered to give by way of particulars of Burnett Waters' knowledge, its reference in para 10(b)(viii)(B) to "having regard to the circumstances known to the respondent" was likewise embarrassingly imprecise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Such language does violence to the concept of particulars, leaving the reader in ignorance of what the allegedly known circumstances might be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The Conservation Council resisted being required to furnish further particulars beyond those conceded in argument on the following additional bases: 
(a) The request made in the letter of 24 February 2009 was tantamount to a second request, rather than a request for clarification of the answer to the request made last year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">(b) There was "little utility" in particularising further [the Conservation Council's] allegations of recklessness due to the issues raised in [Burnett waters'] Defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">(c) Many of the requests are for evidence rather than particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">(d) The request misunderstands the word "action" in the [EPBC Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">It is true to say that Burnett Water did not have leave to deliver a second request for particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Given that, it would have been better if, in their letter of 24 February 2009, its solicitors had exclusively adopted the practice of seeking, on the basis of an explained alleged inadequacy of answer and by reference to particular paragraphs of the request which was made as provided for by interlocutory direction, further and better particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">It may not be coincidence that, in respect of a subject where its solicitors did choose to adopt this practice in their letter of 24 February 2009, a concession was made by the Conservation Council, albeit belatedly in the course of oral argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It would seem that the Conservation Council's notion that there is "little utility" in ordering further particulars in respect of the allegation in the statement of claim of recklessness is derived from Burnett Waters' pleading further or alternatively in its defence that it has acted honestly and reasonably at all times and not at any time acted recklessly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The fact that Burnett Water has alleged in its defence that it has at all times acted honestly and reasonably does not mean that, as to the contested element of recklessness, in respect of the proof of which the Conservation Council bears the onus, the Conservation Council is ipso facto excused from being ordered to furnish such particulars of its recklessness allegation as may be just.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Further consideration of whether to order the furnishing of further and better particulars, including of the allegation of recklessness, requires the setting out of s 142A of the EPBC Act and of certain provisions of the Criminal Code which bear upon s 142A.</sentence>

<sentence id="s270">(4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">

 5.6 Offences that do not specify fault elements 
 (1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">(2) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists of a circumstance or a result, recklessness is the fault element for that physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Note: Under subsection 5.4(4), recklessness can be established by proving intention, knowledge or recklessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">

 
 6.1 Strict liability 
 (1) If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of strict liability: 
 (a) there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and 
 (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">
 (2) If a law that creates an offence provides that strict liability applies to a particular physical element of the offence:
 (a) there are no fault elements for that physical element; and
 (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is available in relation to that physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">(3) The existence of strict liability does not make any other defence unavailable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">

 Paragraph 6 of the statement of claim is incorporated by reference into para 8, which alleges a breach of s 142A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Paragraph 8 is not, with respect, well pleaded in that it does little more than baldly to allege a contravention of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">It does not even condescend to specify whether it is s 142A(1) or s 142A(3) of the EPBC Act that Burnett Water is alleged to have contravened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">That it is intended to be s 142A(1) may be inferred from the so-called particulars given under that paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Strictly, these so-called particulars under para 8 in the statement of claim are material allegations of fact which ought to have featured in discrete paragraphs of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">As Burnett Water correctly notes in its submissions, there is ample authority to support the striking out of a pleading of this kind on a strict application of a pleading rule such as O 11 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules : H 1976 Nominees v Galli [1979] FCA 74 ; (1979) 30 ALR 181 at 186-187; Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-115 and McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 418, [23] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Particulars are not a substitute for the allegation of material facts: H 1976 Nominees v Galli [1979] FCA 74 ; (1979) 30 ALR 181 at 186-187.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Equally though, as Burnett Water fairly concedes, there is a discernable tendency in modern times against striking out when a pleading even with such a technical fault can be seen fairly to convey when read as a whole, including its so-called particulars, the case which a respondent has to answer: Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1999) ATPR 41-691 at 42,827-9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Recklessness aside, the remaining complaints made in Burnett Waters' solicitor's letter of 24 February 2009 concerning the adequacy of the existing particulars are premised upon its preferred construction of the word "action" where it appears in s 142A(1) of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Burnett Water contends that, where the word is used in paras (a), (b) and (c) of the subsection and in contrast to its use in the subsection's opening words, it does not bear the meaning given to the word in s 523 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Section 528 of the EPBC Act provides that, unless the contrary intention appears, the word "action" has the meaning given by Subdiv A of Div 1 of Pt 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Section 523, found within Subdiv A of Div 1 of Pt 23, defines "Action" thus: 
 523 Actions 

(1) Subject to this Subdivision, action includes:
 
(a) a project; and
 
(b) a development; and
 
(c) an undertaking; and
 
(d) an activity or series of activities; and
 
(e) an alteration of any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Burnett Water submits that it is necessary to distinguish between the "action" which was approved and the "action" or "omission" sought to be characterised as "reckless".</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Were it otherwise, it submits that an offence against s 142A could only be committed if the whole of the project were carried out recklessly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">It observes that the Conservation Council has not framed its case this way as it alleges that particular aspects of the overall project are reckless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">I have already described how the Conservation Council further particularised the alleged "action" in its letter of 25 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Having regard to how it has done that, there is merit in the observation made by Burnett Water as to the way in which the Conservation Council has framed its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">That this is indeed the Conservation Council's position is confirmed from its written submission, "The relevant action ... is the design, installation and operation of the fish transfer device on the Paradise Dam".</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">There are vices in the statement of claim and they have translated into the consequential submissions of each of the parties with respect to particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The statement of claim ignores what precisely were the "actions" approved by the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">This, in turn, has occasioned each party difficulty; on the one hand in adequately particularising the statement of claim and, on the other, in determining whether such particulars as were furnished were adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Having regard to the terms of the Ministerial approval, there were, on analysis, three "actions" which were approved: 
(a) the construction of a dam of a particular capacity at a particular location;
 
(b) the operation of that dam;
 
(c) the making of controlled discharges from that dam for particular purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Each of these is an "action" as defined by s 523 of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The construction of a dam may be regarded as a "project", a "development" or an "undertaking", it matters not which.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The operation of a dam is an "activity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The making of controlled discharges is a "series of activities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The "approval" to which s 142A(1)(b) of the EPBC Act refers is the approval of an "action", as described in the opening words of the subsection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Incorporating the effect of the Criminal Code , if that "action" is taken or omitted to be taken and so doing or omitting so to do contravenes a condition of the approval and the person is reckless to that fact, the physical elements of s 142A(1)(a) and the fault element of s 142A(1)(b) will have been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">If, for example, in taking the approved "action" of the construction of the dam, Burnett Water did not install a suitable fish transfer device, it would breach condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Installation of such a device is not an approved "action" in its own right, as opposed to being a condition of an approved "action", the latter being the construction of the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">It follows from this that I do not accept Burnett Waters' submission that "action" bears different meanings as between the opening words and the paragraphs of s 142A(1) of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim contains the allegation, "in purported compliance with condition 3 of the approval the respondent has constructed a fish transfer device on the dam".</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">This rolls up a number of allegations of material facts which ought separately to be pleaded if they are to form part of the case the Conservation Council seeks to make against Burnett Water, viz: 
(a) The Minister has approved (a fact pleaded in an elliptical way in paragraph 4 of the statement of claim) the taking of particular "actions" by Burnett Water, giving particulars of the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">(b) The approval of the taking of those "actions" is, materially, subject to condition 3 (again, a fact pleaded in an elliptical way in paragraph 4 of the statement of claim).</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">(c) Burnett Water has taken an "action" namely, the construction of the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">(d) In constructing the dam, Burnett Water has installed a fish transfer device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">(e) The fish transfer device is not suitable for lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">(f) In the premises, the construction of the dam contravenes condition 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">If an "omission" or another "action", eg the operation of the dam, is to be relied upon these ought to be the subject of separate allegations of material facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">These is no substitute for a critical analysis of the elements of each alleged contravention and resultant identification of the material facts which must thereby be alleged and proved.. "Design" per se is not an "action" that the Minister has approved, although as a matter of common sense it doubtless preceded the approved activity of "construction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Though the Conservation Council has chosen to include "design" in its further particulars of what are said to constitute Burnett Waters' "actions", that is not an "action" which it has alleged in para 6 of its statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Ironically, para 4 of the statement of claim does refer to "actions" that were approved --- construction and operation of the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Paragraph 6 does not, in terms, engage with a ministerially approved action, instead treating aspects of condition 3, the installation and operation of a suitable fish transfer device, as if they were approved "actions" in their own right, as opposed to being conditions of the taking of approved "actions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Based on the allegations in para 6 of the statement of claim, but without any reflection upon precisely what material facts ought to be pleaded having regard to the constituent elements of a contravention of the respective sections, para 7 of the statement of claim makes a bald allegation of the contravention by Burnett Water of ss 142 and 142B of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">In short, even without turning to the subject of recklessness, the more one analyses the adequacy of the particulars and further particulars furnished to date by the Conservation Council having regard to the allegations made in the existing statement of claim, the more is exposed a lack of a comprehensive, accurate engagement by the statement of claim itself with the elements of a cause of action under ss 142, 142A(1) or 142B of the EPBC Act respectively in light of the terms and conditions of the Ministerial approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">The material facts necessary to ground such contraventions having regard to the terms of the Ministerial approval of actions subject to conditions and the alleged position so far as the suitability for lungfish of the installed fish transfer device have not been adequately pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">This seems to me to be the root cause of the differences that have emerged in relation to particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">It may well be possible to apprehend the case that the Conservation Council seeks to make from its existing pleading, particulars and further particulars but so to do involves a degree of benevolent construction, speculation and assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Burnett Water has, in my opinion, approached the matter in this manner, hence it has pressed for further particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">I do not criticise it for so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">I note that Burnett Water's written submissions record that it has not "at this stage" sought the striking out of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Its oral submissions did though allow that, on the authorities, repleading may be an alternative to the ordering of particulars and its notice of motion sought such further or other orders as the Court deemed fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">If the prolixity of the requests and answers in respect of particulars demonstrate nothing else, they demonstrate that this is a case which should benefit from a more strict application of the pleading rule than has hitherto informed the drawing of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Giving due weight to authority which admits of a reading of allegations of material fact and purported particulars as a whole so as to judge the adequacy of a pleading, it is nonetheless preferable in this instance that the Conservation Council replead the statement of claim, incorporating or separately furnishing such particulars as it may be advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">It is important that alleged contraventions said to warrant the granting of mandatory injunctive relief be identified with precision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The ultimate hearing and determination of the proceeding will be advantaged by the repleading in a more disciplined and focussed way of the statement of claim and the consequential filing of an amended defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">That strikes me as a better alternative than seeking to cure deficiencies in the existing statement of claim by ordering the provision of yet further particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The discovery and inspection which has taken place will not, in my opinion, be wasted work if that course is adopted because Burnett Water has to date done its best to apprehend the likely case it has to meet and approached discovery accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">To order repleading of the statement of claim is, of course, fraught with the possibility of yet further interlocutory skirmishes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The drawing of an amended statement of claim will though be informed by the experience of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">So disposing of the application renders unnecessary the reaching of a concluded view as to whether some of the further requests made of the Conservation Council really sought evidence rather than the further particularisation of material allegations of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Because the subject was fully argued, some comment ought though to be made in relation to the pleading and particularisation of the fault element of recklessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">An allegation that a respondent is reckless as to the fact that an action or omission contravenes a condition of an approval is a necessary allegation of a material fact in the pleading of an alleged contravention of s 142A(1) of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Paragraph 142A(1)(b) supplies a fault element for the physical element, set out in s 142A(1)(a), of taking an "action" or alternatively omitting to take an "action".</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Subsection 5.4(4) of the Criminal Code is therefore applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Thus, recklessness for the purposes of s 142A(1)(b) of the EPBC Act may be proved in a number of ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">It may be proved either by intention, knowledge or recklessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Intention is the province of s 5.1 of the Criminal Code and knowledge the province of s 5.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">As to recklessness itself, the words "the action or omission contravenes a condition attached to the approval" in s 142A(1)(b) refer to a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Therefore, it is s 5.4(2) which specifies the manner in which recklessness itself is to be proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Such an analysis informed Burnett Waters' request for the furnishing of further and better particulars of the allegation that it had been reckless and its submission that it was entitled to an order for the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">What follows from this is that some care is needed in the pleading of the fault element of an alleged contravention of s 142A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">For example, if the taking of the action of the construction of the dam is alleged to constitute a contravention of condition 3 because the installed fish transfer device is not suitable for lungfish and recklessness alone is to be relied upon (rather than intention or knowledge), the statement of claim would have to allege as material facts that: 
(a) Burnett Water was aware of a substantial risk that the result namely, contravention of condition 3 because the installed fish transfer device is not suitable for lungfish, would occur; and
 
(b) having regard to the circumstances known to it, it was unjustifiable to take the risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Of these allegations, allegation (a) would at least require particulars of the alleged unsuitability of the installed device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Particulars may also be required of the facts, matters and circumstances by reference to which it was alleged that Burnett Water was aware of the risk concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Were such particulars not to be furnished, a modern pleading rule such as O 12 r 5(2)(a) of the Federal Court Rules would enable them to be ordered, as Fitzgerald J (as his Honour then was) highlighted by reference to English authority in Lyons v Kern Konstructions (Townsville) Pty Ltd (1983) 47 ALR 114 at 124-126.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">As to allegation (b), this would at least require particulars of the circumstances said to be known to Burnett Water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Again, given the disposition of the application, it is unnecessary to decide whether the Conservation Council should be ordered to furnish particulars of the individuals by whose conduct Burnett Water is said to have been reckless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">However, the foundation for the request does require comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">That foundation was based on what one might describe as "reverse engineering", grounded in ss 498B(1) and 498B(2) of the EPBC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">These provide: 
 498B Conduct of directors, employees and agents 
 Bodies corporate---conduct 
 (1) Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:
 (a) by a director, employee or agent of the body corporate within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority; or
 (b) by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a director, employee or agent of the body corporate, where the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the director, employee or agent;
 is to be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in also by the body corporate unless the body corporate establishes that the body corporate took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Bodies corporate---state of mind 
 (2) If, for the purposes of this Act, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of a body corporate in relation to particular conduct, it is sufficient to show:
 (a) that the conduct was engaged in by a person as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b); and
 (b) that the person had that state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">

 These subsections facilitate the proof of corporate conduct or a corporate state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">They have an evidentiary impact but they are not exhaustive of how either conduct or a state of mind may be proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Particulars may be ordered of material facts but not of the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Were, for example, allegations (a) and (b) to be particularised in the manner just described, I should, at least as presently advised, have difficulty in seeing how s 498B provided a charter for an automatic entitlement to an order for particulars of individuals who were alleged to have engaged in the approved action or who had an awareness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">That is not to say that in some instances the furnishing of particulars of facts, matters and circumstances relevant to the allegation of corporate awareness might not incorporate as a particular that a named corporate officer was aware of a fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Further, an inability either by the use of s 498B of the EPBC Act or otherwise to prove the elements that underlie an allegation of recklessness ought to give pause for thought as to whether to make such an allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">It is not though necessary in the circumstances further to consider this aspect of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">
 The claim for injunctive relief concerning a suitable fish transfer device 
 Section 475 of the EPBC Act makes provision for the granting of injunctions for contraventions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Materially, that section provides: 
 475 Injunctions for contravention of the Act 
 Applications for injunctions 
 (1) If a person has engaged, engages or proposes to engage in conduct consisting of an act or omission that constitutes an offence or other contravention of this Act or the regulations:
 (a) the Minister; or
 (b) an interested person (other than an unincorporated
 organisation); or
 (c) a person acting on behalf of an unincorporated organisation that is an interested person;
 may apply to the Federal Court for an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Prohibitory injunctions 
 ...
 Mandatory injunctions 
 (4) If a person has refused or failed, or is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail to do an act, and the refusal or failure did, does or would constitute an offence or other contravention of this Act or the regulations, the Court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">

 Burnett Water drew attention to authority, a notable exemplar of which is Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd [1970] AC 653 , which counsels the framing of injunctive relief requiring the performance of an act in terms which are sufficiently precise to enable the person to whom the injunction is directed to know what is required of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Such precision also allows those concerned in his performance readily to ascertain whether the act has been performed as ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">As Lord Upjohn, with whom the other members of the House agreed, put it in his speech in Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd [1970] AC at 666: 
 If in the exercise of its discretion the court decides that it is a proper case to grant a mandatory injunction, then the court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what in fact he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as a matter of fact, so that in carrying out an order he can give his contractors the proper instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">

 A generation later, in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores Holdings Ltd [1998] AC 1 at 14, Lord Hoffman, with whom the other members of the House agreed, in the course of a speech which contains much detailed reflection on the subject of considerations relevant to the granting of mandatory injunctions, referred to that passage from Lord Upjohn's speech and stated: 
 Precision is of course a question of degree and the courts have shown themselves willing to cope with a certain degree of imprecision in cases of orders requiring the achievement of a result in which the plaintiff's merits appeared strong; like all the reasons which I have been discussing, it is, taken alone, merely a discretionary matter to be taken into account: see Spry on Equitable Remedies (4th ed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">) at p. 112.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">It is, however, a very important one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">

 It is not at this interlocutory stage possible to determine whether the merits of the Conservation Council's case are strong and the extent to which, as a matter of discretion, that should influence the framing of any injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">In conferring the jurisdiction under s 475 to grant mandatory injunctive relief Parliament has envisaged an exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a court that is one of law and equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Where a contravention is proved, the granting of a mandatory injunction requires the exercise of a judicial discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">However, the jurisdiction is statutory, not an incident of the general law of equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">There are features of the jurisdiction so conferred which set aside considerations which might, under the general law of equity, dispose a court not to grant injunctive relief at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Thus, s 479(2) provides: 
 Mandatory injunctions 
 (2) The Federal Court may grant an injunction requiring a person to do
 a particular act or thing:
 (a) whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do the act or thing; and
 (b) whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to
 do the act or thing; and
 (c) whether or not there is a significant risk of injury or damage to human beings or the environment if the person refuses or fails, or continues to refuse or fail, to do the act or thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">

 
In light of this provision Parliament must be taken to have considered that there were public interests arising from the objects of the EPBC Act in the case of, materially, a proved contravention of a condition of an approval for the taking of an "action" which, in particular cases, would transcend the considerations referred to in s 479(2) and, notwithstanding those considerations, warrant the granting of a mandatory injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">As Black CJ and Finkelstein J reminded in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at 431, [18] , s 475 of the EPBC Act makes provision for a remedy of a kind that has come to be known as a public interest injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">In this regard, the EPBC Act is not unique.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">It is an analogue of s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Observations made by the members of the Full Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 are pertinent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Materially, in that case, the following observations, presently pertinent by analogy, were made in relation to the framing of injunctive relief: 
Mr Justice Lockhart, French J agreeing, stated, at 259-260:
 
 Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed: see Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited [1985] FCA 389 ; (1985) 7 FCR 495 ; Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Pty Limited (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-414; and Commodore Business Machines Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">

 
 Decisions under the Act have applied these principles and the judgments refer to the dangers of orders being cast in broad terms which "train the heavy guns of the law upon the respondent" ( Glo Juice at 418) without giving him adequate guidance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">

 
 As Toohey J. observed in Maclean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Limited (1984) 2 FCR 593 (at 599): 

 
 "Any injunction granted should be in such terms that is reasonably capable of being obeyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">... (The order sought) would create uncertainty and place the respondent in a position where it would not know with any precision what was required of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">It follows that, faced with an application to enforce such an injunction, the court would be in an equally difficult position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">" 

 
 See also Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited .</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">

 
 In Commodore a Full Court of this Court said at 574: 

 
 "The injunction sought in the application was in the following terms: 'An injunction restraining (Commodore) from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of the supply of Amiga computers (as defined in the statement of claim) supplied by ( Commodore ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">'
 An injunction in that form might be suggested by the relief granted by the Commonwealth Industrial Court in Festival Stores v Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 69 ; (1971) 18 FLR 260.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">On appeal, reported [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 631-2, Barwick C.J. rejected an attack on the propriety of an order which enjoined a wholesaler 'from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of tableware marketed ... under the trade name 'Mikasa'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">' 

 
 Nevertheless, such an injunction as that sought by the Commission in this case would have been open to the objection that it was of an undesirable width because, in respect of the supply of Amiga computers, it did no more than reproduce, but this time with the risk of sanctions for contempt, that which the Act in terms forbade by s 48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Any practice of awarding injunctions in such a form is to be discouraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Such injunctions conflict with the general precept, applicable to the exercise of power under s 80 of the Act as much as to the framing of injunctions in aid of legal and equitable rights, that a final injunction should bear upon the case alleged and proved against the defendant, and should indicate that conduct which is enjoined or commanded to be performed, so that the defendant knows what is expected of him as a matter of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Further, where the injunction is in the form of an interlocutory order, it is undesirable to frame the injunction in such a way as to leave the issues in the case open for determination on a contempt proceeding, rather than at a final hearing: see generally Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union [1984] FCA 202 ; (1984) 3 FCR 55 at 65-6; 54 ALR 730 (Full Court); Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Co Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-16 (Burchett J) and Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 331 at 347 (Pincus J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">" 

 
 The drafting of injunctions is ultimately a practical question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">In some cases it presents no difficulties to the draftsman, but in others the exercise is far from easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">

 
 Mr Justice Gummow made the following observations (at 266-267): 

 
 In Mr Heydon's work "Trade Practices Law" para.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">18.740, the view is expressed that whilst in concept the statutory remedy provided for in s. 80 of the Act is different from the equitable remedy of injunction as administered in the inherent jurisdiction of courts of equity, nevertheless "in many practical respects it is not, however, fundamentally distinct from the equitable remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">" I agree with that observation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">

 
 ... 

 
 Sub-section 80(1) confers upon the Court the power to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in paras.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">(a)-(f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The power of the Court to grant an injunction is controlled by the words "in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">" 

 
 Thus, the terms of the injunction will not be "appropriate" if, on its face, it operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s. 80 with contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">The injunction should not prohibit conduct falling outside the boundaries drawn by s. 80: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The same limitation applies to mandatory injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">It is, in my view, no support for the grant of an injunction which, from the outset, has an operation outside the boundaries of s. 80, to say that it is open for the party enjoined to apply under sub-s. 80(3) to vary the injunction so as to bring its operation wholly within proper limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">The party in question should not be placed under any such obligation in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">

 
 In the course of his expressing agreement with the judgement of Lockhart J, French J observed (at 268) of the power to grant injunctive relief conferred by s 80 of the Trade Practices Act , "The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">" 

 Attention needs to be given to the language of s 475 when considering both the nature of the power conferred and the remedy which may appropriately be granted pursuant to that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">In context, if a failure to do an act namely, the construction of a dam incorporating an installed fish transfer device suitable for lungfish constitutes an offence or other contravention of the EPBC Act because the dam as constructed does not have installed such a fish transfer device, thereby breaching a condition of the approval for the taking of that act, the Court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act, ie to incorporate in the dam a fish transfer device suitable for lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">There is no evidence that Burnett Water challenged condition 3 of the Minister's approval on the basis that it was manifestly unreasonable because it required the performance of a task that was impossible or was cast in terms that were so uncertain as to be devoid of sensible meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Indeed, had the installation of such a device been impossible, that may, given the objects of the EPBC Act and the protection afforded to the lungfish, have called into question whether the Minister should have approved the construction of the dam at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The relief sought by the Conservation Council in para 2 of the application is cast in more precise terms than the terms of condition 3 of the Ministerial approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">It is enough at present that the relief sought bears a reasonably arguable relationship with that which the statute permits the Court to grant and the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">In my opinion, it does.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">The claim for this relief is neither frivolous nor vexatious nor an abuse of process either for the purposes of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules or for the purposes of s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">The proposed relief certainly does more than just recite the terms of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">It is more precise than that which in the circumstances of ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission was regarded as appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Whether it is appropriate to grant relief in terms of para 2 of the application, other terms (and that further or other relief was sought was foreshadowed in oral submissions by the Conservation Council) or at all depends on the proof of a contravention, on the construction of condition 3 and on the evidence led at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Given that para 2 does not warrant being summarily struck out, it is not appropriate to consider the issues mentioned in the preceding sentence either in the abstract or as a separate question divorced from the evidence at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd and ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission are not cases which compel the summary striking out of para 2 of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The statutory preconditions for the granting of a mandatory injunction are set out in s 475.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">It is up to the Conservation Council to prove that these are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">It is no part of so doing that it must prove that any particular fish transfer device is suitable, as opposed to proving, inter alia, that the device which has been installed does not meet condition 3, properly construed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">To require proof of the former would be to invert the statutory preconditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In this regard, I accept the submission made on behalf of the Conservation Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">If the Conservation Council proves those preconditions, a judicial discretion is enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Considerations such as those set out in Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd are, in a non-exhaustive way, relevant to the formulation of injunctive relief in the exercise of that discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission establishes that injunctive relief granted under a power akin to s 475 of the EPBC Act must bear a relationship with the case alleged and proved and must be cast in terms which admit of an understanding of what is expected of the party enjoined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">It does not follow from this that the Conservation Council is obliged to give particulars of what is a suitable fish transfer device for lungfish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">It may, if it chooses, lead evidence touching on that subject as part of its case as to why the existing, installed device is unsuitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">If so, that evidence, together with other evidence led at the trial, may well inform how any injunctive relief ought to be cast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The Conservation Council has also, in framing para 2 of the relief sought, specified a six month time limit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">One reason why such a time limit might be reasonable may be that, on the evidence led at trial, it is possible, within that time, to install a particular device or to modify the existing one such that it is "suitable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">If the Conservation Council leads no evidence on that subject, then, depending on the other evidence, if any, it may be unreasonable to specify such a time limit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Again, whether or not a, or any, particular time limit ought to be specified is not a question to be answered in the abstract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">I decline to order that paragraph 2 be struck out or to order the Conservation Council to give particulars of what is alleged to be a suitable fish transfer device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">
 Discovery --- water quality 
 The question of how to dispose of the Conservation Council's application for further discovery admits of a ready answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">It has not made it apparent from the pleadings, such as they are, the particulars, prolix though they are, the existing evidence or otherwise from the nature and circumstances of the case that documents touching on the subject specified in the application are directly relevant to an issue in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">In instituting these proceedings the Conservation Council engaged judicial, not administrative, power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Further, the proceedings are not inquisitorial in character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Order 15 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules confers a power to make an order for particular discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">However, the occasion for the making of such an order pursuant to that power has not been demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The Conservation Council's application for further discovery must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">
 Disposition and further directions 
 Having regard to my preference for the striking out of the existing statement of claim with a grant of leave to file an amended statement of claim, rather than to make an order for the furnishing of further and better particulars, some modification of the consequential directions proposed by each party on the hearing of the notices of motion will be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I shall therefore hear submissions on that subject and costs upon the publication of these reasons for judgement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">I certify that the preceding sixty-three (63) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
