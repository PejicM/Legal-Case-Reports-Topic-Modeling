 HIS HONOUR: 
 
1 The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of Korea (South Korea).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In June 1999 he was an unlawful non-citizen who had been detained in immigration detention at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (Villawood).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 16 June 1999, following an incident in which he and others were involved, he was taken to a NSW prison, the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater (Silverwater).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He was held there and at the prison hospital in Long Bay gaol until 1 March 2000 when he was returned to Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Between June 1999 and March 2000 he was not the subject of any criminal charge nor under any sentence imposed by a court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">His claim is that his imprisonment at Silverwater was unlawful and is actionable in damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He ultimately sought to assert that:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Neither the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Migration Act ) nor any NSW legislation gave the governors of the respective prisons any lawful authority to detain him, and there was no other lawful authority for them to do so; the Commonwealth is said to be vicariously liable in damages for such false imprisonment by the governors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Chapter III of the Australian Constitution prohibits the Commonwealth from imprisoning a person merely unlawfully in Australia in a place of criminal detention except as part of the recognised criminal processes, following the laying of a criminal charge against the person; likewise any State law or arrangement facilitating such illegal imprisonment is also invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Furlong, the Operations Manager of Villawood who recommended to Departmental officers that Mr Soh be transferred to Silverwater, committed the tort of misfeasance in a public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Neither Mr Nicholls, the Departmental officer who made the decision that a NSW prisons official should be requested to take Mr Soh into custody, nor Ms Symons, the officer who implemented that decision, afforded Mr Soh procedural fairness before Ms Symons made the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The request was therefore invalid and the Commonwealth had no right in law to detain the applicant in Long Bay or Silverwater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In consequence, the Commonwealth falsely imprisoned him there and is liable in damages for that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These propositions were relied on to ground the following causes of action:
 
&#8226; false imprisonment
 
&#8226; misfeasance by a public officer
 
&#8226; an allegedly novel tort of intentional "unconstitutional detention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">2 In my view, the various assertions of illegality cannot be sustained, with the exception of the claim that Mr Soh was owed a duty of procedural fairness that was not fulfilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Even though such duty was not fulfilled and the immediate consequence of that was his imprisonment in Silverwater and Long Bay, such imprisonment does not, at least in the circumstances of this case, give rise to an action for false imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Such denial of procedural fairness does not, in my opinion, sound in damages for Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">There were other practical remedies that might reasonably have been availed of in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The statutory setting 
 
3 The Migration Act provided as follows:
 
 
 
 189 Detention of unlawful non-citizens 
 
 (1) If an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone is an unlawful non-citizen, the officer must detain the person.</sentence>

 (b) any person ordered to be imprisoned in or committed to a correctional centre, otherwise than as referred to in the definition of convicted inmate , by any court, judge or justice or other competent authority or otherwise than under the Intoxicated Persons Act 1979 .</sentence>

<sentence id="s39">Regulation 128 provided that telephone calls could be monitored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Departmental policy 
 
11 At the time of Mr Soh's detention, there was a standing Departmental instruction in force headed "MSI-157: Transfer of Detainees to State Prisons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Among other things MSI-157 said:
 2 DETENTION IN PRISONS 
 
 2.1 Detention of immigration detainees within prisons occurs as a last resort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In this restricted context it can occur for a number of reasons, which include: 
 
 Behavioural concerns &#8226; While being held at an IDC a person's behaviour is considered to be unacceptable for the low security IDC environment, because of: - the risk to other detainees; - violent behaviour and/or unlawful behaviour, the inability of management and the detainee to resolve the unacceptable behaviour; or - the risk of absconding from lawful custody; or &#8226; at the time of being taken into immigration detention a person is assessed as being unsuitable to mix with other detainees at an IDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 3 DECISION MAKING IN THE TRANSFER PROCESS 
 
 3.1 There is no clear statutory basis for the selective transfer of detainees and the decision to transfer a detainee from an IDC to a prison should be made as a last resort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The decision to transfer a detainee to a prison should be made by the State Director or the Director's delegate, usually the OIC of Compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Where this is not possible eg the decision on a transfer needs to be made after hours or at weekends, it should be endorsed by the State Director or the delegate on the first working day after it takes place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
... 
 
 3.3 In deciding whether to transfer a detainee to a state prison decision makers will need to take into account any factors in the detainee's behaviour which raise questions as to whether it is in the best interests of the efficient running of the IDC or of the detainee himself/herself to continue to remain in the IDC, bearing in mind that IDCs are low security establishments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">These factors could include the inability of management and the detainee to resolve the unacceptable behaviour, harassment of, or threats towards other detainees, criminal activity particularly if it involves violence, escape or attempted escape, or evidence that the person is suffering from a psychiatric illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 
 
 3.4 All decisions to transfer a detainee must be fully documented to ensure that the transfer process is transparent and accountable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This may include but need not be limited to file notes regarding, the incident/or sequence of incidents of unacceptable behaviour, counselling sessions, additional strategies implemented to address behaviour concerns, and medical/psychiatric assessments and/or intervention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Decision makers must ensure that a detainee is not transferred to a prison as a form of punishment for actions while in the IDC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">[Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">] 
 
 4 GROUNDS FOR TRANSFER 
 
 4.1 Unacceptable behaviour 
 
 
 
 4.1.1 Clear communication between management and the detainee is essential when unacceptable behaviour is the concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">At all times the detainee needs to have a clear understanding of the possible outcome of their behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Officers need to: 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; consider the use of a qualified interpreter/translator when undertaking the following management strategies and if a decision is made to transfer the detainee; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; thoroughly document their management of unacceptable behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 
 4.1.2 Detainees should be counselled regarding their unacceptable behaviour and advised that unless there is an improvement in conduct, removal to a correctional institution may result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is important that detainees are informed of the possible outcomes of their behaviour and appreciate their share of responsibility in resolving the issue of unacceptable behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Additional warnings, counselling sessions and/or the withdrawal of privileges may also be considered depending on the nature and severity of the behavioural problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">For instance, the use of 'time-out' or a 'cooling-off period' in a neutral space (for a short period), to allow a detainee to calm down may be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is no limit to the number of counselling or 'time-out' sessions that a detainee may undergo; the important thing is that on each occasion, the conflict/aggression is defused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 
 
 4.1.3 Isolation may be considered as a stronger measure which could be used in conjunction with counselling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Medical advice should always be sought where any period of extended isolation is considered necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
... 4.2 Continuing risk to other detainees 
 
 4.2.1 There must be reasonable grounds to believe that the continued presence of the detainee in the IDC would threaten the safety of other detainees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
... 
 
 4.6 
 Allegations of unlawful behaviour involving detainees 
 
 
 
 4.6.1 In all cases, involving allegations of unlawful behaviour, consideration should be given to reporting the matter to the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Factors taken into consideration include the seriousness of the act, the intention and maliciousness of the act, and the effect on the daily operations of the IDC if no action is taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In dealing with allegations of a criminal nature, every care must be taken to protect the rights of the parties involved, and also to ensure that there are no further possible infringements of the law in trying to deal with the alleged matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 
 
 4.6.2 Consideration should also be given to the likelihood of success in laying charges in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, it is ultimately the role of the police investigator and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to determine the likelihood of success of the prosecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Factors to be taken into account include the quality of the evidence and possibly, the seriousness of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is questionable, in terms of the national interest, to pursue prosecution where the penalties are likely to be minimal or if there is little chance of a conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
... 5 ADVICE TO DETAINEES 
 
 5.1 In all instances where the transfer of custody is to occur, a notice detailing the reasons for the transfer must be given to the detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">...
 
 5.1.1 The Notice should be completed so that the detainee is well aware of the incidents or behaviour that has lead to the decision to transfer him or her into other custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Notice also informs the detainee of the procedures for seeking a review of the place of detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">...
 6 CASE MANAGEMENT 
 ...
 6.1.3 Although the determination of the security classification of detainees held in prison is made by the prison authorities, the case officer should seek to ensure that the prison system does not over-classify immigration detainees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is desirable for immigration detainees to be held in remand areas of the prison, to reduce any exposure to violent convicted criminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 The individuals involved in Mr Soh's being transferred to Silverwater 
 
12 Mr Nicholls , who made the decision that Mr Soh should go to prison, was the NSW Director of the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (the Department).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Ms Symons was the officer who gave effect to that decision and actually made the request to the Superintendent of Silverwater to hold Mr Soh there on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Mr Nicholls had acted on the recommendation of Mr Donatiello , the Department's Immigration Manager at Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Among other tasks, Mr Donatiello liaised between a company, Australasian Correctional Management Pty Limited (ACM) and his departmental supervisors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">ACM actually managed Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The decision on behalf of ACM to recommend to the Department that Mr Soh be transferred into a prison was apparently taken by Mr Vita , ACM's manager of the Villawood centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Mr Furlong , an ACM Operations Manager made the actual recommendation to the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He had information from ACM Detention Officers Sruhan, Haddad and Hughes and had interviewed Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">He also had knowledge of other previous reports by various ACM employees about Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Mr Soh's background as known to Mr Furlong 
 
13 Mr Furlong, who had very little actual recollection of the crucial events, is likely to have known the following about Mr Soh's history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">14 Mr Soh was born in South Korea on 13 June 1964.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He had been sentenced in Australia on 26 November 1996 to three months' periodic detention for making a false statement in connection with a 1993 application for permanent residence here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">On 10 December 1997 Mr Soh was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">15 Upon his release he was immediately transferred to Villawood, arriving there on 9 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">16 In July 1998, following events which included complaints about food and a refusal to attend muster by some Chinese or Korean detainees, Mr Soh and others were warned by ACM staff that "should disruptive behaviour continue, those responsible would be considered for transfer to the prison system".</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">17 In September 1998 a detainee in a witness protection program newly received at Villawood professed fear of Mr Soh, alleging that he and Soh had both been standover men at Kings Cross.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The detainee's concerns regarding his apparent recognition were supported by police officers from the NSW Police Service State Protection Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Centre Manager recommended that the detainee should be transferred elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">18 On 4 February 1999 an ACM employee observed Mr Soh involved in a fight at Villawood with another detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Mr Soh was placed "in Cell C1" (before being seen by a nurse) and the other man was immediately taken to the medical centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">19 Mr Soh had some general history of involving himself in matters concerning difficulties between other detainees and Villawood management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He was better educated and spoke better English than most detainees at Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The events of 7 and 8 June 1999 
 
20 An Indonesian detainee, Mr Pesik, was scheduled for departure from Villawood for repatriation to Indonesia on 8 June.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Practice in such circumstances was to "lock down" the detainee in Cell 1 to enable observations of him/her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Detainees facing imminent removal were frequently emotional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">21 Mr Pesik's fellow Indonesians understood that his family would be left in Sydney and also that he had some legal proceedings under way and could normally expect not to be removed from Australia until such proceedings were concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">They felt he was being hastily and unfairly dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">They gathered in an area known as "the Fishbowl".</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They expressed their concerns to an ACM Detention Officer and asked him to convey their feelings to the supervisor Ms Sruhan, which he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">22 Ms Sruhan attended and spoke to a representative of the group, Mr Rozi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Rozi asked her whether Pesik could be released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Upon her declining, he asked whether Pesik could make a phone call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Ms Sruhan indicated she would consider this but only after the general (and usual) evening lock down of all inmates in Stage 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">23 As she was walking away a Korean detainee, Jae Bum Kim, approached her and made similar requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He walked off in a rude fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Kim then spoke to Mr Soh and another detainee Wijay Wijaya.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The three of them then told officer Haddad that if Pesik was not released within half an hour there was "going to be ... big trouble" and that, as Mr Haddad reported, "they will strike and do whatever they have to, they said they did not care about the officers, supervisors or the operations manager".</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">24 A "General Request Form 527" in the name of "All Detainees" was handed to an ACM officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It read:
 Urgertly [sic] Antention!</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">[sic] To Supervisor Centre Manager, Immigration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">We want our brother with us out of the cell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">We know he is having a case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">According to the law he must not be deported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">We want reconciliation with half an hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">ALL ASIANS PACIFIC 
25 It was signed by a considerable number of people, including Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">26 At about 8.45 pm Ms Sruhan reported this to Mr Furlong, who was then offsite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">He told Ms Sruhan that he would come to Villawood and that she should report the events to Mr Vita, which she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">27 Mr Vita instructed her to release Mr Pesik, which she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 At about 8.50 pm according to ACM Detention Officer Hughes, he saw Mr Soh in a dormitory "inciting unruly behaviour with a group of Chinese and Indonesian detainee's [sic]", about 20 of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Hughes heard one of the group shout "Kill them" and soon after a shout "Get the knife".</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">29 Mr Furlong attended Villawood at about 9 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He recorded that he "spoke with detainee Soh and asked ... had they threaten[ed] the lives of Officers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mr Soh allegedly "replied that they didn't care what they had to do".</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Soh was then "counselled about his behaviour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">30 Next morning Mr Furlong understood that detainees had been overheard by officer Dawson to say that they "intended to watch over Pesik all night and [any] attempt to remove him would be [met] with violence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">31 Stage 1 was for male detainees regarded, for a variety of reasons, as higher risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">There were only limited facilities for separating any particularly troublesome Stage 1 detainees from others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">32 The next morning there was a routine meeting of ACM and Departmental staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It was then decided that Mr Furlong should propose the transfer of Messrs Soh, Kim and Wijaya to a prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">33 
 
On 8 June he wrote:
 Detainees KIM, SOH and WIJAYA are considered to be high-risk, having been involve [sic] in a number of issues whilst at the VIDC [Villawood], all detainees have been linked to an incident at the VIDC on the night of Monday 7th June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Where the three detainees threatened the lives of Officers, Supervisors, and Management and the security of the VIDC unless another detainee PESIK was released from a secure room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The detainees gave the duty Detention Supervisor 30 minutes before the matter would be taken into there [sic] own hands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In view of the information received it is believed that to house either of the detainees in the low security environment of the VIDC is inappropriate and against the good order and security of the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It is therefore the recommendation of the Management of this facility that all detainees be removed to the Silverwater Remand and Reception Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">(Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">) 
34 On the same day Mr Donatiello received that memorandum and a detailed incident report from Mr Furlong, also signed by Mr Vita.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The incident report concluded:
 Local DIMA Manager Mr Frank Donatiello and Centre Manager VITA have been advised of the situation and will be kept appraised of any further developments regarding this incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">... A MSI 157 has been raised and forwarded to DIMA requesting that detainees KIM, SOH, and WIJAYA be removed from the facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">35 Mr Donatiello wrote a Minute to Mr Nicholls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">He forwarded the material received from Mr Furlong and referred to paras 2.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 of MSI-157.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">He continued:
 The incident reports provided by ACM concerning Mr Soh's behaviour indicate Mr Soh together with two other detainees threatened that if an Indonesian national due for removal on 8/6/99 was not released from a cell within 30 minutes "there would be big trouble" and that if it does not happen they would strike, they do not care what they have to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">As a result of this incident the Asian community in Acacia grouped together and were heard making comments that they would create a disturbance to prevent the Indonesian detainee from leaving and would slice the officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Mr Soh was observed later in the evening in one of the detainee dormitorys [sic] inciting a group of 20 Chinese and Indonesian detainees from whom the comments "kill them" and "get the knife" were heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Mr Soh has shown no sign that this behaviour is unacceptable and was later involved in standing guard to prevent ACM officers from removing the Indonesian national.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Reports have previously been received regarding Mr Soh's role in agitating fellow detainees and he has been counselled about his behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">His behaviour in this latest incident makes him unsuitable for the low security environment of the VIDC and he poses a risk to the good order and management of the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">RECOMMENDATION Given his behaviour and the risk he presents to other detainees and staff, it would seem appropriate to transfer him to a State facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I recommend that SOH Jay Ho be transferred to a State Facility and that, in accordance with MSI 157 he be provided with the attached Notice of transfer to a Person in Detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The decision to transfer and the request to the prison governor 
 
36 On 12 June Mr Nicholls signified his agreement with Mr Donatiello's recommendation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">37 On 16 June Ms Symons sent a request in the following form to the Superintendent of Silverwater:

<sentence id="s157">K Symons Signature 16/6/99 Date 
38 That document with another, a "Notice of Transfer to Person in Immigration Detention" was on the same day given to Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The Notice informed him:
 To SOH Jay Ho I, Kay Symons, am an officer for the purpose of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">You are currently detained under the Act at Immigration Detention Centre, Villawood and are to be transferred to SILVERWATER MRRC On 16/6/1999 Section 5 of the Act states that a person is held in immigration detention if being held by or on behalf of an officer at a place specified in paragraph (b) of that definition (immigration detention).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">This notice is to inform you that you are to be transferred from your current place of immigration detention to be held in another place of immigration detention (as defined in section 5 of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The reason(s) for this transfer are as follows: You were involved on 7/6/99 in agitating other detainees towards violence to prevent the removal of another detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">As you made threats to the lives of staff and present a threat to other detainees and to the good management of the low security environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Your unacceptable behaviour cannot be managed in the low security environment of the IDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Counselling about your behaviour in the past has not resulted in an improvement and it has been deemed appropriate to transfer you to a state facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">You are to be transferred immediately and there is no review of this act of transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">REVIEW OF PLACE OF DETENTION The continuation of your detention in this other place of immigration detention will be reviewed within 7 days of the date of this notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The reasons for your transfer will be reviewed at the time to determine whether it is suitable to return you to your current place of immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">This review will be conducted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) in conjunction with the Australian Protective Service, and will take into account your behaviour whilst you are detained in this other place of immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">RIGHT TO COMPLAIN TO THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN The Commonwealth Ombudsman is an official appointed by the Australian Government to investigate complaints made against Government Departments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">If you think that the Department has done something unfair, or unreasonable, or wrong in its dealings with you, then you have the right to contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ask them to investigate your complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">39 Mr Soh refused to sign the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Mr Soh's time in gaol 
 
40 Mr Soh was taken to Silverwater on 16 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">41 His detention there was reviewed and confirmed at the Department's State Director level on 5 July and 29 July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">A class action he had joined was apparently dismissed by this Court on 8 July and thereafter, a Departmental officer wrote:
 We have since been provided with evidence by Mr Soh's legal representative that he is now a member of the "Lie-High" class action and we have sought advice from Legal Branch Canberra as to whether removal action should proceed in light of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr Soh will continue to be monitored while in Immigration detention at the MRRC, as per the Ombudsman's directive, on a monthly basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 The first of these reviews appear to have proceeded without any input from Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He was however visited by his Departmental case officer on 8 July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">He "became agitated and raised his voice ... and asked why he was transferred [to Silverwater].</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He claimed that he was not a trouble maker".</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">43 He was again seen on 28 July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">He said he was "sick of detention and should never have been transferred", and that he "was not a troublemaker and always attended muster".</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">44 A visit to Mr Soh on 26 August was summarised thus:
 he said that he did not understand why he was transferred from the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He knows that he complained to Kay Symons a few times, but he maintains he was not a trouble maker and always attended muster throughout the year that he was there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">He says that he is scared at the MRRC because he knows he is in with criminals, even murderers, and he is not a criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He is going to wait in Australia for the outcome of his class action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He was hostile and spoke aggressively during the visit ... 
45 Departmental officers reported this to Mr Nicholls and said:
 Management at VIDC are not prepared to have Mr Soh return there in view of recent escapes, and other events, as he is considered to be a risk for the good management of the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Their most recent advice of 23 August 1999 in relation to this was "Jay Soh's previous behaviour at the low security environment for the VIDC was inappropriate ... Mr Soh would be a risk to the good order of the VIDC" ... Mr Soh continues to be held in detention, as he has ongoing Litigation pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In the previous submission to you he was a part of the "Kagi" class action, however the Federal Court dismissed this on 8 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">We have been provided with evidence by Mr Soh's legal representative that he is now a member of the "Lie-High" class action which Legal Branch Canberra have accepted as a valid class action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Mr Soh maintains that he should never have been transferred to a Correctional Centre and wishes to return to the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">There have been no adverse reports from the Department of Correctional Services regarding Mr Soh's behaviour since being transferred from the VIDC to the MRRC on 16 June 1999, however, it is submitted that the initial circumstances in relation to his place of detention have not changed, and that his current detention arrangements should be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">46 Mr Nicholls accepted this recommendation on 3 September 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">47 In connection with the next review on 29 September 1999, Mr Soh was seen on 27 September 1999 but apparently said little relevant to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">48 The recommendation to Mr Nicholls, with which he concurred, was again:
 There have been no adverse reports from the Department of Corrective Services regarding Mr Soh's behaviour since being transferred from the VIDC to the MRRC on 16 June 1999, however, it is submitted that the initial circumstances in relation to his place of detention have not changed, and that his current detention arrangements should be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">49 On 26 October, according to the records:
 Mr Soh was visited by Departmental officers on 26 October 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">He had no complaints but stated that he is having nightmares and is getting very sick, which he believed had to do with him continuing to stay in the MRRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">50 The recommendation and decision of 2 November were as before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Mr Soh's hunger strike 
 
51 Things changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It was reported to Mr Nicholls on 1 December 1999:
 Mr Soh was visited by Departmental officers on 26 October 1999...</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">He admitted that he behaved badly at the VIDC but was annoyed because others whose behaviour was worse than his did not get punished (ie transferred to a state prison).</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">He accused ACM officers of lying on their reports about him and said that if he is not transferred to the VIDC or released from custody he would stage a hunger strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">He handed me a letter that outlined the reasons for this... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Management at VIDC were asked to comment on Mr Soh's suitability for the Detention Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">I put forward concerns that their previous comments ... did not contain enough compelling reasons to keep Mr Soh in a state prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Their most recent advice of 30 November 1999 stated that it would be preferable if Mr Soh did not return due to "overcrowding in Stage 1 where most of the community are Asians who are extremely unsettled at the present time" but will accept Mr Soh if you give consent... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Mr Soh continues to be held in detention, as he has ongoing Litigation pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">He is now a member of the "Lie-High" class action which Legal Branch Canberra have accepted as a valid class action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">There have been no adverse reports from the Department of Corrective Services regarding Mr Soh's behaviour since being transferred from the VIDC to the MRRC on 16 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In light of this and ACM's advice, it is open to you to recommend whether Mr Soh is suitable to return to the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">(Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">) 
52 However Mr Nicholls seems to have decided that he should stay at Silverwater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The following then occurred:
 On 13 December 1999 Mr Soh wrote a letter to [Mr Nicholls] asking for an explanation of the allegations that he was a trouble maker, a security risk, of bad behaviour and tried to escape when he was at the VIDC ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">He advised that he would stage a hunger strike in protest until he received a reasonable answer to this inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He began his hunger strike on 14 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Mr Soh was given a written reply on 23 December 1999 from Bill Doszpot, Detentions Manager at the VIDC... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Since the last review he has been visited by an Immigration officer on four occasions --- 15, 23 and 31 December 1999 and 5 January 2000... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">These visits have occurred due to his continuing hunger strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">When not visited regular contact is made with Long Bay Gaol Hospital for updates on his condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">He is currently on a drip and does not take any solid food but consumes Sustagen drink and fluids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Corrective services have advised that currently there are no concerns about his condition but will notify DIMA should any cause for concern occurs [sic] or should his condition become serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">On the most recent visit he advised that he will continue the hunger strike until he is re-admitted to the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">He maintains that he was not a trouble maker but merely tried to help other detainees who could not speak English... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">53 The recommendation duly accepted was:
 There have been no adverse reports from the Department of Corrective Services regarding Mr Soh's behaviour since being transferred from the VIDC to a state prison, however what is of concern is his continual inability to accept the reasons for this transfer and his hunger strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It is therefore submitted that the initial circumstances in relation to his place of detention have not changed, and that his current detention arrangements should be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Mr Soh will continue to be monitored while in Immigration detention at a Correctional facility, as per the Ombudsman's directive, on a monthly basis, with more contact being maintained during his hunger strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">54 It was reported that Mr Soh ceased the hunger strike on 28 January 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It appears that:
 Also since concluding his hunger strike, Mr Soh's solicitor lodged a submission on Mr Soh's behalf requesting return to the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The submission states in part that "he will not engage in any conduct which is inconsistent with the good order and management of the Immigration Detention Centre at Villawood and any previous conduct which had enlivened concern is regretted and will not be repeated"... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Management at VIDC have advised on 4 February 2000 that it would be inappropriate to have Mr Soh returned to the low security environment of the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">As previously advised by the ACM Centre Manager this decision was based on the current circumstances relating to Mr Soh's criminal background, his history of his behaviour at the VIDC and the current overcrowding in Stage 1, he is of the opinion that Mr Soh cannot be managed in the low security at the VIDC... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Mr Soh continues to be held in detention, as he has ongoing Litigation pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">He is now a member of the "Lie-High" class action which Legal Branch Canberra have accepted as a valid class action, and for which Mr Soh is eligible to apply for a BVE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">(Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">) 
55 Mr Nicholls however wished "to see a further period of acceptable behaviour" before Mr Soh should be returned to Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">56 
 
Finally, on 28 February 2000 Mr Nicholls accepted a recommendation that:
 Although ACM and DIMA VIDC management are not in agreement for the return of Mr Soh, given that he now acknowledges his previous behaviour was unacceptable and undertakes not to engage in that type of behaviour again, and given that apart from his hunger strike episode there have been no adverse reports from DCS, it is open to you to decide that transfer back to Villawood is now appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">57 It appears that:
 Since the last review Mr Soh was visited by an Immigration officer on 16 February 2000... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Also since the last review The Department of Corrective Services advised on 28 February 2000 that Mr Soh has been of no concern since his arrival back at the MMTC and since his ceasing of the hunger strike has continued to maintain his good behaviour... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Mr Soh's solicitor has lodged a further submission dated 25 February 2000 on Mr Soh's behalf which reiterates that "he will not engage in any conduct which is inconsistent with the good order and management of the Immigration Detention Centre at Villawood and any previous conduct which had enlivened concern is regretted and will not be repeated"... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">(Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">) Mr Soh's account 
 
58 Such were the views from the vantage points of the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Mr Soh's account was different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">59 In South Korea he had some post-secondary education and had been an army sergeant on office work before coming to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">He had never worked as a gangster in Kings Cross.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">At Silverwater the food was often the subject of complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Living conditions were unclean and overcrowded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Mr Soh had complained to the authorities including, as I understood it, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Fights were frequent at Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">He was never involved in a fight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">60 On 7 June 1999 Mr Soh was watching television.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Mr Kim and two Indonesians came and asked him to interpret in Mr Pesik's interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">One of the Indonesians was a Chinese man who could speak in Korean and he explained the problem to Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">He agreed to interpret.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">There were 20-25 Indonesian and other Asian detainees there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Mr Soh explained to Ms Sruhan that Mr Pesik wished to contact his family who lived in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">She said, in effect, that she could do nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 Mr Soh explained to the Indonesians that they should not make trouble but write out a request form and give it to the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Somebody did that and Mr Soh gave it to Mr Haddad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">He told Haddad that the Indonesians were threatening to make trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 The Indonesians had told Mr Soh that if Mr Pesik were not released they would take the officers' keys from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Mr Soh says he advised them against this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The Indonesians also threatened to refuse to muster and to start a hunger strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">When he saw Mr Furlong, Mr Soh told him of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Mr Furlong said he would send them all to prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">63 At no time did he threaten to join in the trouble-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">64 Mr Soh says he did not threaten any officer and knew nothing of any threat to use a knife on an officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">65 On 16 June he was detained at Villawood in "the solitary room" and Ms Symons and/or other officers told him that he was a troublemaker and they were sending him to maximum security in prison; it was related to the incident of 7 June.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He was then taken in a van to Silverwater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">66 He began the hunger strike on 14 December because he had done nothing wrong and should not be in prison, and he ceased it on either 18 or 28 January 2000 when he had a paper saying he would be transferred back to Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">When he began the hunger strike he was sent to a prison hospital at Long Bay gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">67 At Silverwater, although it was a remand centre, it was full of convicts and people going to court for various offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">He saw occasions of violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">He was searched using dogs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">His previous prison sentence had been served at an unfenced prison farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">68 Cross-examination as to the events with the ACM officers elicited the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Mr Soh spoke first to Ms Sruhan, then Mr Haddad and then Mr Furlong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He did not tell Mr Furlong about the Indonesians' threat to make trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He did so tell Mr Haddad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He told Mr Haddad that the Indonesians were saying that if Pesik was not released in 30 minutes there would be big trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">He denied that he said that all the detainees would join in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He got along well with Mr Haddad and considered him "a very good guy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He denied congregating with the other protesting detainees after speaking to the officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">69 At first he said that he did not write the note of complaint, but later agreed that he wrote the words "all detainees".</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">By that he meant all the Indonesian detainees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">He realised it was a complaint by all Asians and Pacific Islanders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">70 He admitted he had been involved in a fight at Villawood but that was responding to a blow to him from behind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">He turned and punched his attacker once.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">He claimed that in his evidence in chief he had said he was involved in a fight on one occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">71 When he spoke to Mr Furlong, Furlong said "All of you will be sent to Silverwater gaol".</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">On earlier occasions when he, Soh, had complained about the food, Mr Furlong had told him to shut up "otherwise I will send you to gaol".</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">What actually happened?</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">
 
72 Years after the event, Mr Soh struck me generally as an attractive and intelligent individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">He gave evidence by video link from South Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">There appear to have been some difficulties with the translation of his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">73 As best I can judge the matter, Mr Soh was meaning to indicate to the ACM officers that all the detainees or at least all the Asians and Pacific Islanders would actively protest and, in effect, do whatever was necessary to prevent Mr Pesik being deported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I think he has come to believe something different, and probably so persuaded himself when he was in Silverwater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It needs to be said however that there might possibly have been room for misunderstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">An unbiased contemporary interview with Mr Soh by Mr Nicholls or a senior and independent Departmental delegate would likely have helped to decide the matter more safely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">74 Mr Furlong's truthfulness was attacked but I formed no impression he was lying in suggesting his lack of memory of events or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I think that Mr Furlong did think, and might in all the circumstances reasonably have thought, that Mr Soh was allying himself with threats that could involve serious trouble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Mr Furlong thought that "the raising of an MSI[-157] was not a guarantee of anybody going anywhere", that is that a recommendation by him might not be agreed to by the Departmental officer responsible for the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">75 It seems probable that Mr Furlong would, as he conceded, have warned detainees that continuation or repetition of that conduct could lead to their being transferred to a State prison, if he considered them to be a threat to the safety and security of Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">76 Mr Furlong was not asked, after Soh's transfer to Silverwater, whether he was prepared to have him back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">77 Ms Sruhan recalls a threat to staff, an "aggressive stance" by some detainees and concern for the well-being of staff and other detainees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Mr Soh liked to put himself forward, she thought, in order to "build his own profile" amongst the detainees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">He postured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">She knew him as an inflexible negotiator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">She did not wish to speak to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">He was apparently the best educated and most articulate of the three named as principal participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The report from officer Dawson was the first threat of violence with a weapon to an officer she had heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">78 It appears that there were other detention centres, particularly at Maribyrnong that had more secure facilities for people who appeared troublesome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">79 Mr Nicholls did not give evidence nor did Ms Symons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">They are unlikely to have remembered much about the events of June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">It obviously did not occur to either of them, nor to Mr Furlong, Mr Vita or Mr Donatiello, to sit quietly with Mr Soh to see if he had a version of the events of 7 and 8 June that might be consistent with his not being a threat to the good order of Villawood or if he otherwise had anything to say (such as an apparently sincere apology and a solemn promise not do any such things again) which might have cast the question of his likely future conduct in a different light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">80 The MSI-157 policy did not suggest that such a version of procedural fairness was required, nor did the report of the Ombudsman after investigating the system in 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The causes of action: (1) False imprisonment 
 
81 This claim is put on three alternative bases: 
 
(i) the relevant provisions of the Migration Act did not confer any authority on a person, including a prison governor, requested by an officer to hold a detainee to do so nor did the NSW legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">(ii) Mr Nicholls/Ms Symons had a duty to afford the applicant natural justice; both of them failed to do so, and the request to the prison governor was therefore a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">(iii) Section 5(1) of the Migration Act is invalid as permitting executive officers to usurp part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth which the Constitution vests exclusively in the courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">(i) The prison governors' authority to hold an immigration detainee 
 
82 While immigration detainees are ex hypothesi not lawfully in Australia, they nevertheless have the protection of Australian law as well as liabilities under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Nobody may be deprived of his or her freedom unless a statute or the common law authorises it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Legislation should be jealously interpreted against unnecessary or unclear implication of such authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">83 It is however the case that the very notion of compulsory detention of people implies, as a matter of practical necessity, that those responsible for the detention should have sufficient power to change the nature and place of the detention as circumstances require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Possible threats to good order in, and the safety of other people at, the place of detention are but one of the circumstances that show that necessity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Considerations of the health or welfare of a particular detainee are other examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Perceived threats to the safety and good order of an institution may be incapable of legal proof and may need to be dealt with promptly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">There might be many instances in which it is practically necessary to detain an unlawful non-citizen in a prison, notably the unavailability of suitably secure accommodation subject to administration by persons under a strict duty themselves to behave properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Those circumstances are not limited to the initial detention of such a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">It is not to be thought that the Parliament intended that officers placed under a duty to detain people in immigration detention should lack the power, when bona fide thought necessary, to arrange for a person not initially detained in a prison later to be so detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">84 Prisons in Australia are established and operated under the auspices of the States and Territories and laws made by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">They are staffed by governmental officers or employees or by employees of private contractors subject to strict standards and legal controls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">In all cases, there are standards and public expectations of decent food and health care, secure accommodation of sufficient modest comfort, and effective but fair disciplinary systems and administrative procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">85 It is in this setting that the intention to be imputed to the Parliament by its adoption of the phrase "in a prison or remand centre of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory" falls for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">If the phrase is interpreted to mean only that an officer may arrange that a detainee be held within, and in that sense "in", the physical boundaries of a place that is a prison or remand centre, but that the phrase was not intended to confer authority on the officer to have the detainee made subject to the control of the ordinary prison etc authorities, then the applicant's argument would succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">But the consequences would include that the detaining officer or his/her supervisors would need urgently to arrange for other "officers" to detain the person within such boundaries or to have pre-arranged facilities for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">This would make urgent detention in a prison etc quite impossible in many cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">In my opinion, such an inconvenient result, possibly including threats to peace and good order, or prejudice to the health or welfare of the subject detainee, should not be imputed as the parliamentary approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">86 The matter may also be viewed in another way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">It is clear that immigration detainees are subjected to a liability that may include detention in a prison or remand centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Such institutions are not only places, they are institutions and they are run in particular and well-understood ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">How strange it would be that detainees might be so liable yet, as the applicant urges, have a right without more , to sue the public officials (or their private enterprise contractual aides) engaged in so running such institutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The Parliament should not be taken to have authorised such a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In my opinion the Act should be interpreted as necessarily depriving the detainee of any such rights and as granting the otherwise lawful gaolers in the prisons and remand centres immunity from any such suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The latter would remain liable of course for any otherwise illegal maltreatment of a detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">This view better accords generally with the approach taken in Behrooz v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 36 ; (2004) 219 CLR 486 to a different but analogous problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">87 On this view, the provisions of the Correctional Centres Act, if they would otherwise have anything to do with the case, have no relevant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">I doubt that, in any event, they do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In the ordinary case of imprisonment or remand in custody, it is the law as to penal confinement and the criminal process (or as to mental health or the like) not the prisons legislation, which gives the judge etc the power to order a deprivation of liberty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">It is the order of the judge or other official which has the effect of the deprivation of the subject person's right to liberty and which authorises the executive arm of government to implement such deprivation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The warrants that are usually issued by courts serve simply to assure the relevant executive officers (or other persons with an interest in the matter) that such an order has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Section 39 of the Correctional Centres Act and its succeeding sections in Part 8 are concerned with fixing the identity of the executive officers charged, from time to time, with giving effect to a court's order, and otherwise indicating merely how it is to be implemented, including, under s 46, by giving immunity from suit for bona fide purported performance of acts that the statute contemplates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">88 In that context there is no need, in the interests of vindicating the presumption against statutory interference with liberty (or otherwise), to read the concept "or other competent authority" in the s 4 definition of "inmate" in the Correctional Centres Act as being limited to authorities of the same kinds as are referred to in the preceding words, namely persons acting at least quasi-judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">It seems more likely that the framers of that legislation intended to "make a fresh start" by employing those words (to adopt a phrase from Chancery: Re Commonwealth Oil Corp Ltd [1917] 1 Ch 404 at 412-3), to provide a general, catch-all description of all authorities of whatever kind that were competent to require the detention of a person in a prison or remand centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">89 The liability of the detainee to detention in a prison etc, has its source in the determination of the relevant Migration Act officer that that should be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Necessarily that determination will be communicated to the detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">A detainee in New South Wales so liable was, in 1999, reasonably enough described as a "person ordered to be imprisoned in or committed to a correctional centre ... by [a] competent authority".</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The s 46 immunity from suit provisions would avail the governor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">If he/she was immune, so was the Commonwealth if its "officer" lawfully caused the governor to imprison the detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">(ii) Procedural fairness 
 
90 The distinction between a duty to accord procedural fairness and its content in particular circumstances (which may be nil) is to be borne in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">(a) Was there a duty?</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">
 
91 As to whether a duty to afford the applicant procedural fairness existed, there are (as mentioned above) some circumstances in which there will be no practical choice as to where and how a person liable to immigration detention is to be detained in pursuance of the apprehending officer's duty to detain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The detainee may resist detention or try to escape; the apprehension may take place in a relatively isolated locality where there is only one choice, and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">There will be other, many other, circumstances in which choices may be made as to which is the preferable of various available places and modes of detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">These will include whether children are involved, physical and emotional health considerations, foreseen disciplinary problems and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The scope for choice is likely wider once initial detention has been secured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Very often there will be no need for urgency in making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">92 There is, in other words, no valid basis for an assumption that the demands of security would necessarily be inconsistent with an implied duty to accord the detainee procedural fairness before an officer decides where and how to effect the detention, whether initially or as may be necessary to consider from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">93 It may be acknowledged that where there really is an imminent risk that secure detention of the intended detainee or of other detainees may be seriously prejudiced by any delay in detaining or relocating him/her, so that there is no effective choice as to where and how to detain, the content of any duty to afford procedural fairness would be nil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">94 In Leghaei v Director General of Security [2005] FCA 1576 , I considered whether the Australian Security and Intelligence Office (ASIO) had a duty to accord procedural fairness to the subject of an intended adverse security assessment, and held that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">95 I venture to repeat what I there said:
 The principles to be applied in relation to the legislative exclusion of procedural fairness were summarised by Finn J in [State of South Australia v] Slipper [2004] FCAFC 164 ; [(2004) 136 FCR 259] at 279-280 (with whom Branson and Finkelstein JJ agreed at [71] and [148]) and I respectfully adopt the following summary by his Honour: 
 
 "(i) when a statute confers a power on a public official the exercise of which affects a person's rights, interests or expectations, the rules of procedural fairness regulate the exercise of that power unless those rules are excluded by express terms or by necessary implication...; 
 
 (ii) a legislative intention to exclude the rules will not be assumed or spelled out from indirect references, uncertain inferences or equivocal considerations...; 
 
 (iii) an intention to exclude should not be inferred merely from the presence in the statute of rights which are commensurate with some of the rules of procedural fairness...; 
 
 (iv) while the rules may be excluded because the power in question is of its nature one to be exercised in circumstances of urgency or emergency... urgency cannot generally be allowed to exclude the right to natural justice... although it may in the circumstances reduce its content...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">(Emphasis added, references omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">) 
 
 
 ... 
There appears to have been no discussion in [a Royal Commission] Report of what rights should exist in relation to the matters occurring prior to any right of review arising, (and before the making of the actual assessment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">It is, however, fair to say that Hope J seems to have assumed that the demands of security would necessarily be inconsistent with any express prescription of a right to be heard at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">There are problems about the validity of that assumption and, in any case, about using an indirect inference from such silence to ground or support an indirect inference which, admittedly with some degree of force, arises from the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Thus, if a person has a feasible right to be told as much of the case as the interests of national security will allow at a review level, then the same right might reasonably be said to exist at the initial assessment stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Further, the task to be undertaken is not to consider whether there is any clearly positively implied intention that procedural fairness requirements apply; rather, it is to consider whether there is a necessary implication that such requirements do not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In this regard, I respectfully agree with Finn J's comment in Slipper at [ 11I]: 
 
 '... against the background of a clearly recognised need to "strike a balance " between private and societal interests, one would have expected the legislature to have spoken with unmistakable clarity if it was to deny rights of procedural fairness that could otherwise have been made available...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">
 
 
In my view, the 'unmistakable clarity' that procedural fairness was to be denied under the ASIO Act is lacking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">
 (Emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">)
 

96 In my view an analogous approach here is appropriate and calls forth a similar result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">97 There was, in my opinion, a duty to accord the applicant appropriate procedural fairness in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">(b) Was the duty complied with?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
98 Whatever threat Mr Soh posed to the good order of Villawood and the safety of officers and perhaps others there, it does not appear that there was any effort to segregate him from the other detainees for any part of the 6 days that it took for Mr Nicholls to make his decision and for Ms Symons to carry it out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">There was a more secure centre than Villawood, although it was in another State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Given a clear and present threat of going back to gaol, Mr Soh may well have been prepared to go a long distance to avoid that fate, even if his denials should be of no avail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">In short, in his particular circumstances, he could reasonably have been given an opportunity to explain why he should not be sent to an actual prison or remand centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The circumstances did not reduce the content of the duty, which I think existed, to give him procedural fairness to nil, or even close to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">He should have been given a hearing but was not --- see [79] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">99 That, however, is not the end of the problem but the beginning of another aspect of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">100 It is difficult, as counsel acknowledged, to draw any clear and reliable proposition of general applicability from the various judgments in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">However, some members of the High Court made pronouncements in that case (at [51], [53] per Gaudron &amp; Gummow JJ, [63] per McHugh J and [152] per Hayne J) that could support a view that, once a denial of a duty to afford procedural fairness is uncovered in respect of a statutorily authorised administrative decision, the decision is to be treated as unlawful and void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">However at least Gaudron and Gummow JJ, at a different point in their joint judgment, hedged their remarks to that effect with qualifications that appear contrary to giving such remarks their full literal force: see [46] and [57].</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">I am in any case bound by Jadwan Pty Ltd v Secretary, Department of Health and Aged Care [2003] FCAFC 288 ; (2003) 143 FCR 1, a decision of the Full Court of this Court to view Bhardwaj 209 CLR 597 as not standing for what the applicant seeks to draw from it (at [42]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">My own view is that, as in most cases, the words used in Bhardwaj 209 CLR 597 are to be regarded as limited to the context of the case in which they were uttered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Among other things Bhardwaj 209 CLR 597 was a case in which there was no discretionary reason to deny relief by way of constitutional writs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">101 It seems to me that, in the present case, where illegality of the decision is sought to be made a sword in an action for damages, a denial of natural justice will not of itself invalidate the applicant's detention at Silverwater rather than at Villawood for any period unless I make a formal declaration to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">102 The making of a declaration is a discretionary remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">I would, in my discretion, decline to make such a declaration notwithstanding that, if the applicant be correct, it would have some utility in enabling him to mount a claim for damages on what might be the consequent invalidity of the Nicholls decision and the Symons request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Any invalidity of the detention at Silverwater for want of procedural fairness did not last long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Within a couple of months, Mr Soh had the repeated opportunity to say why thenceforth he should not be imprisoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">No case was sought to be made that in relation to the various reviews of his position after he was taken into Silverwater he was not afforded procedural fairness or that the consequent decisions were invalid for unreasonableness or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The applicant's complaint about the denial of procedural fairness by Mr Nicholls was first made more than eight years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">There was no chance for the respondent to redress that failure; the applicant was long gone from prison, indeed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">There is no adequate explanation for the applicant's delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">The applicant evidently had actual access to private legal advisors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">In any case, the NSW Legal Aid Commission provided a capable legal aid service for inmates of NSW prisons and remand centres in 1999-2000, as now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">The delay is, in short, unconscionable or "unwarrantable": cf Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 per McHugh J at [149]-[153]; Re Commonwealth; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491 at [16] - [17] ; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [56] ; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [80] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The essential vice of the denial of procedural fairness is the denial itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">That cannot be remedied now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">The public interest can be served by my discussion of the principles and their application to this case, without the necessity for a formal declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">103 The decision to put Mr Soh into a NSW prison should not now be considered to have such illegality as to make his detention there unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">104 If I am wrong about that and damages fall to be assessed, they can only be for the relatively short period until Mr Soh was afforded a hearing which, after his transfer to Silverwater, he was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Soh had previous experience of living among criminals and living to prison discipline, albeit on a prison farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">He was young, assertive, resourceful and strong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">He was in any event liable to detention at Villawood or some such place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">I should try to avoid parsimony but I cannot think that more than $50,000 damages would be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">In giving that expression of view I assume rather than decide that illegal imprisonment of one kind when, in any case, the applicant would be liable to imprisonment (detention) of another should be held to be within the tort of false imprisonment --- it strikes me as the probably preferable route for development of the common law: cf Prisoners A to XX Inclusive v State of New South Wales (1995) 38 NSWLR 622; The King v Bevan; Ex parte Elias and Gordon (1942) 55 CLR 452 ; R v Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; Ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58; Miller v The Queen (1985) 24 DLR (4 th ) 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">(iii) Constitutional invalidity 
 
105 The argument is that, by vesting the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the courts, Ch III of the Constitution prohibits any emanation of the Commonwealth from, as counsel for the applicant put it, "assigning to a place of criminal detention any person unless pursuant to a sentence imposed by a court for a crime or ancillary to the process of securing such a sentence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Further, any State law or administrative arrangement for such detention would also be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The applicant was not such a person and therefore was wrongfully imprisoned by the respective prison governors, for whose conduct the Commonwealth is liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">106 Counsel for the applicant submitted that what was said respectively by Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ and by McHugh J in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 27-9, 32-3 and 71 still provides the relevant test of validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The test is whether the statutory provisions permitting imprisonment of aliens are "reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Further, "if imprisonment goes beyond what is reasonably necessary to achieve the non-punitive object [of deportation], it will be regarded as punitive in character", per McHugh J at 71.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">107 The argument proceeds that confinement in a prison and subjection to prison discipline therein, "the entire regime of prison discipline, coercion and penal administration", among "the general criminal population" is not reasonably necessary to effect the deportation of a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Reliance was also placed upon Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24 ; (1996) 189 CLR 51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">This submission was said not to contravene the expressions of opinion in Behrooz [2004] HCA 36 ; 219 CLR 486 at [20] and [175].</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">108 The Migration Act , it was argued, gives "official[s]" a very broad discretion to detain in a prison; nothing in the Act prevents it being used for punitive purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">As I understand the submission, the Act cannot, conformably with principle, as enunciated in Pidoto v Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87 at 110, 130 and 126, be read down so as to enable detention subject to usual prison regimens of coercion, regimentation and the human environment of a prison, whether in a prison or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">109 The respondent says that the power to detain in a prison is, in many circumstances, including protection of persons and good order in a non-prison detention centre, "reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The respondent further accepts that the officers' powers to detain in a prison must not be exercised for punitive purposes in the sense of punishing perceived misconduct, far less than merely to silence troublesome demagogues, and the Act must be read down accordingly, which it can be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Again, I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">As to conditions in the prisons, if otherwise actionable for trespass against the person or negligent breach of a duty of care, they may be sued upon but the conditions do not make detention in the place of detention unlawful: Behrooz [2004] HCA 36 ; 219 CLR 486.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Again I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">110 The question then becomes whether Mr Soh has been able to establish, as a matter of fact, that he was transferred to punish his involvement in the disturbance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">I think that it was genuinely considered, by those involved in the decision-making, that his continued presence at Villawood was likely to constitute a threat to officers' safety and to good order and reasonable discipline there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">As a matter of reality, it would probably not have been unwelcome to the ACM officers that Mr Soh should find his removal to prison unpleasant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">But the decision was actually taken by Mr Nicholls, (and adopted by Ms Symons) not by any of the ACM people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">111 Mr Nicholls acted on a recommendation by Mr Donatiello.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The minute which contained that recommendation was predicated on Mr Soh's perceived "behaviour and the risk he presents to other detainees and staff".</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">While the perceived behaviour was described, the conclusion was that:
 Mr Soh has shown no sign that this behaviour is unacceptable and was later involved in standing guard to prevent ACM officers from removing the Indonesian national.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Reports have previously been received regarding Mr Soh's role in agitating fellow detainees and he has been counselled about his behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">His behaviour in this latest incident makes him unsuitable for the low security environment of the VIDC and he poses a risk to the good order and management of the VIDC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">112 There was no suggestion that a purpose of putting Mr Soh in prison would be to make him suffer, to deter others, or simply to vindicate the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Mr Donatiello and Mr Nicholls might well have been concerned, on what they understood, about the necessity to act protectively of Villawood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">113 In my opinion Mr Soh has failed to make out his factual premise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">114 It follows that the Constitution did not have the effect of rendering Mr Soh's imprisonment unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The causes of action: (2) Misfeasance in a public office 
 
115 The applicant's case is that Mr Furlong, although an employee of ACM, was "an agent of the Commonwealth" and acting for public purposes in the purported fulfilment of a purported public duty concerning Mr Soh's detention and with the immediate intention of decisively influencing a Commonwealth officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Prima facie it is an attractive idea that the notion of a "public office" should be regarded as broad enough to impose a tortious duty on someone in such a position who maliciously causes another loss or harm by an invalid or unauthorised act, although that is controversial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">116 However, assuming that to be so, the applicant must, among other things, show both that Mr Furlong's act was invalid or unauthorised, and either that he knew it was so or that he actually intended to cause Mr Soh harm: Northern Territory v Mengel (1994) 185 CLR 307.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">117 As to validity for constitutional reasons, I have dealt with this factually in relation to Mr Donatiello and Mr Nicholls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Mr Furlong might well have wished to cause Mr Soh some pain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">But Mr Soh needs to show that Mr Furlong's purpose in making the recommendation that he did was punitive and not protective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Notwithstanding that Mr Furlong may have jumped to unjustified conclusions and may have had some private animus to Mr Soh, I am not so persuaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">He wrote the memorandum that he did because Mr Vita, his ACM superior, being told of events, required it in the interests of the protection of Villawood's people and good order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">There was some apparently real basis for concern about such matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">He would, in my opinion, have written the memorandum whatever his personal feelings about Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">118 As to lack of authority for acting as he did, Mr Furlong had both MSI-157 and Mr Vita's direction to guide him and to rely on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">119 It is also the case that Mr Furlong did not for a moment, in my view, subjectively doubt that he was well-warranted in taking the course that he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">If he also took satisfaction in Mr Soh facing the added discomforts of prison life (which, to a degree, he may well have done) that is, in the light of these findings, insufficient to ground an action against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The causes of action: (3) The "novel tort" of intentional, unconstitutional harm 
 
120 The novel tort suggested is founded on the proposition that Mr Nicholls' decision (and, I take it, Ms Symons' consequent request) was prohibited by the Constitution and actuated by a desire to harm Mr Soh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The legal basis of the supposed cause of action seems very doubtful to me but, in any case, it follows from what I have already said, that the asserted factual basis for the claim and the premise of unconstitutionality have not been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The claim fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">121 For these reasons the application should be dismissed, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">122 I add only that the duty to accord procedural fairness I have held to exist will have implications for other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">It is by no means impossible for officers to comply with such a duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">It would be wise for them to be given assistance on how to comply with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Prompt legal action by a person entitled to procedural fairness might well result at least in an injunction restraining a transfer from one place of detention to another or even an order quashing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-two (122) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.</sentence>
