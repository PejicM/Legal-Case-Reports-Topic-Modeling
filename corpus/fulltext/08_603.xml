1 The applicant Mr Mark Gordon applied for a position as a GST Compliance Officer, APS 4 level, in the Launceston office of the Australian Taxation Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The ATO made him an offer of employment, subject to, amongst other things, a condition that should he be found unfit for employment the offer would be withdrawn or his employment terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He commenced work but shortly afterwards the ATO withdrew the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">His medical assessment on behalf of the ATO had revealed a blood pressure reading of 200/110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On reassessment some three weeks later the reading was 200/125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2 Mr Gordon claims that he has been subject to discrimination in employment contrary to s 15(2)(c) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability by dismissing the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 There was disputed evidence as to the true level of Mr Gordon's hypertension, particularly in light of the fact that he appears to have been subject to a well known medical condition known as "white coat syndrome".</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">This refers to the anxiety people often have when undergoing medical tests which results in a higher blood pressure reading than would otherwise be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">However, while hypertension is undoubtedly a "disability" as defined in s 4 of the Act ("(e) the malfunction... of a part of the person's body") the term includes a disability that "(k) is imputed to a person".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 For the purpose of the Act, according to s 5(1) , discrimination occurs 
 if, because of the aggrieved person's disability, the discriminator treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person without the disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The disability imputed to Mr Gordon was that of a person with a serious level of hypertension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 Section 15(2)(c) relevantly provides:
 It is unlawful for an employer... to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability... ... (c) by dismissing the employee... 
6 The respondent relies on the defence provided by s 15(4) of the Act which provides: 
 Neither paragraph (1)(b) nor (2)(c) renders unlawful discrimination by an employer against a person on the ground of the person's disability, if taking into account the person's past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular employment and, if the person is already employed by the employer, the person's performance as an employee, and all other relevant factors that it is reasonable to take into account, the person because of his or her disability: 
 
 (a) would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular employment; or
 (b) would, in order to carry out those requirements, require services or facilities that are not required by persons without the disability and the provision of which would impose an unjustifiable hardship on the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 

7 The respondent says that one of the inherent requirements of this particular employment was extensive driving and to carry out those requirements Mr Gordon would require services or facilities which would impose an unjustifiable hardship on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The job had other physical demands, to which reference will be made, but driving was the critical requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 In the s 15(4) context the question arises whether it is the actual or imputed condition of Mr Gordon at the time of dismissal that is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Gordon's career 
 
9 At the time of the alleged discrimination in May 2003 Mr Gordon was a single man aged 39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">10 He held the degrees of Bachelor of Economics (Hons) (University of Tasmania 1993) and Master of Business Administration (Bond University 1991).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He had qualified as a Certified Practising Accountant in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He had two outstanding units to complete towards the Graduate Diploma in Applied Finance and Investment (Securities Institute).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">11 From 1985 to 1995 he worked for the Department of Veterans' Affairs in various clerical positions with the ranking of ASO 2 and later ASO 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">12 From May 1995 to February 1996 he was with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission at ASO 5 level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His duties included financial and prudential analysis and auditing superannuation funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">13 From February 1996 to December 2001 he was employed by the ATO, initially at ASO 2 and later ASO 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Towards the end of this period he worked in the Interpretation and Compliance Section completing audit investigations, examining work related expenses and issuing Private Binding Rulings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">14 From July 2001 until April 2003 he conducted a business as a private tax agent from his home in Hobart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Offer of employment 
 
15 On 22 March 2003 the ATO advised Mr Gordon by email that his application to work as a GST Field Officer at APS 4 level in Launceston had been successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This was confirmed in a letter headed "Offer of Ongoing Employment" dated 10 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">16 The Offer was stated to be subject to the conditions set out in the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">One of these was:
 All new ongoing employees are required to undergo a medical examination to satisfy the ATO of their fitness to undertake the duties for which they have been selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">You would have already attended a medical assessment prior to commencing duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Should you be found unfit for employment, this employment offer may be withdrawn or your employment terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">17 Another condition stated there would be a probation period of four months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">During this period the employee would receive training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">If the employee did not make satisfactory progress during the probation period, employment would be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">18 The Offer enclosed a "Medical Evaluation" issued by Health Services Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This document explained that with the introduction of the GST the new position of "GST Field Officer" had been created within the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Relevantly for present purposes it included the following:
 Does the doctor decide whether I get the job or not?</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The doctor will complete the form providing to Australian Taxation Office all the medical information about you that is relevant to your ability to do the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">While the doctor will certainly provide medical recommendations regarding your fitness to do the work, the decision on your employment remains with Australian Taxation Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">... Medical Adviser Guidance Notes ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In reality very few medical conditions are an absolute contra-indication to employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">However, there are certain GST Field Officer tasks such as driving in which conditions pre-disposing to sudden loss of consciousness, poor vision or hearing could pose a health risk; ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The following procedure is suggested for borderline cases: 
 
 &#8226; Discuss the case with an Occupational Physician in order to further clarify the fitness for work issues;
 &#8226; Discuss the case with the referring ATO officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">ATO have indicated they will provide the doctor with guidance as to criteria against which an applicant is to be assessed if they do not meet the recommendation ie whether reasonable adjustments can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">A work performance can be requested;
 &#8226; The applicant's treating doctor may clarify health issues;
 &#8226; Referral for assessment with an Occupational Physician if approved by ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 
 
19 General Information enclosed with the Offer included as requirements of the position:
 
 
 &#8226; Concentrate for prolonged periods in order to drive safely and perform client interviews in country and metropolitan regions...
 &#8226; Transport computer, printer and printed literature to/from ATO regional office, vehicle and client premises with the use of carrying aids such as a trolley...
 &#8226; Physically enter client premises which may involve walking up steps, stairs, ramps or uneven terrain which could be slippery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 


 
20 Under the heading "Specific Work Hazards" it was noted that clients may react unfavourably and that field officers entering "difficult client" premises alone could be harassed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Further it was said:
 The need to drive for prolonged periods outside of work hours means fatigue is a specific work hazard... 
21 The Offer stated that, if Mr Gordon wished to accept it, he would need to complete and return a "Notification of Acceptance" and other enclosed forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The evidence does not disclose whether this happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The case of the respondent is that the offer of employment was withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As will be discussed below, for the purposes of s 15(2)(c) it does not matter whether an offer of employment was withdrawn before acceptance or whether a contract of employment which had come into existence was terminated by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Assessment by Dr Payne 
 
22 On 22 April 2003 Mr Gordon was examined by Dr Ian Payne of Health Services Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Immediately prior to the assessment Mr Gordon filled out a questionnaire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In answer to the question "Do you or have you ever had high blood pressure?</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">" he ticked "yes" and added "Have had reading of 160/110 doctor left untreated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">23 Dr Payne took a blood pressure reading of 200/110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In his report he stated that he told Mr Gordon "that he would speak to the ATO about it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Gordon's weight, taken by Dr Payne's nurse, was recorded as 138.8 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">24 Mr Gordon was aware of the reading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He understood the purpose of the examination was to assess his fitness for the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He was asked: 
 And Dr Payne told you that in his view you weren't fit for that job?</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">--- He said I couldn't start yet and he also said he would talk to the Tax Office about my situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">25 On the same day Mr Gordon saw his General Practitioner, Dr Michael Mee, who recorded a reading of 190/105.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Dr Mee prescribed some medication for blood pressure treatment which Mr Gordon commenced on 25 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">(The evidence disclosed many blood pressure readings for Mr Gordon both before and after his examination by Dr Payne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">These are set out in a schedule to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The medical practitioners referred to are Dr Mee and Dr Russell Cooper (General Practitioners), Dr Payne, Dr Tomas McArdle (General Practitioner) and Dr Warrick Bishop (Cardiologist).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">)
 Employment and termination 
 
26 On Dr Payne's record of the examination of 22 April there is a notation: 
 Has not provided ATO contact details at [sic] day of examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">27 Mr Ian Godden was the director of GST staff in Tasmania and as delegate of the Commissioner of Taxation had the authority to withdraw the offer to Mr Gordon (or, presumably, terminate his employment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He swore an affidavit on which he was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Godden deposed that on 28 April the training program for newly appointed field officers commenced in Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He continued:
 Although Mr Gordon had not satisfied the medical precondition, he was allowed to commence training as there had been no indication that he would not be certified medically fit for work and, on the assumption that his employment would proceed, we did not want him to miss out on any training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">28 On 28 April Mr Gordon commenced duties at the ATO office in Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">29 Some time later (it is not clear exactly when, but it must have been no later than 8 May) the ATO received Dr Payne's report, which stated that Mr Gordon was not fit for his employment duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">30 On 8 May Mr Gordon was called away from training to a meeting room where his site manager and team leader were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">He was handed a letter dated 8 May signed by Mr Godden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The letter stated that the offer of ongoing employment was subject to the condition, amongst others, that he undergo a medical examination to satisfy the ATO of his fitness for duty as an Australian Public Service employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The ATO had now received a report on the examination performed by Dr Payne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">On the basis of this report 
 it has been concluded that you are not medically fit for duties you have been selected to carry out as an APS 4 GST Field Compliance operative in the APS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The letter advised that the report was held by a named officer and was available for him to discuss with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The offer of employment was withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">31 On the same day Mr Gordon returned to Hobart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">On 9 May he visited Dr Mee who recorded his blood pressure at 170/105.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Dr Mee refused to provide Mr Gordon with a medical certificate for Centrelink on the grounds that he considered Mr Gordon to be fit for normal sedentary office duties and for interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Dr Mee supplied a certificate to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Mr Gordon spoke to a delegate of the ATO who advised him that an appointment had been made on 13 May for a review with Dr Payne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">32 On 13 May Mr Gordon attended for a second examination by Dr Payne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The blood pressure reading was 200/125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">33 On 15 and 19 May Mr Gordon had blood pressure readings taken as noted in the schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">34 Dr Payne reported to the ATO in a letter dated 2 June.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He noted that he had seen Mr Gordon on 22 April with regard to his fitness for work as a GST Field Officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He was at that stage 
 deemed unfit for this work due to 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Hypertension 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Hashimoto's disease (recently ceased medication and had not been monitored since then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Thus although asymptomatic his thyroid status was unknown) 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Inflammation of an ingrown toe nail 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Morbid obesity 
35 He was referred to his General Practitioner for follow up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Dr Payne noted that since the previous consultation Mr Gordon reported he had attended his treating General Practitioner with regard to the medical conditions mentioned above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He had been on medication for hypertension with an increasing dosage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">His blood pressure had not at that stage stabilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">His lipid studies were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">As to thyroid function, blood tests indicated a raised TSH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He had been placed back on thyroxin tablets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He had started to exercise and modified his diet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He had arranged an appointment for removal of his toe nail the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">36 Dr Payne's clinical findings were:
 His Blood Pressure was still raised but I do recognise the anxiety provoking situation that he finds himself in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">However it is likely that it will take some further time to stabilise his blood pressure as he is still on increasing dosages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He has reduced some weight now falling into the obese range not the morbidly obese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">This still remains a risk factor in control of his blood pressure, general health and well being and risk of physical injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">His toe was less inflamed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">37 Dr Payne thought Mr Gordon still had further to go with regard to stabilization of his blood pressure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">This remained a risk particularly with regard to the duties of the position and the driving component.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There was also the aspect that at that stage he could not say whether the potential side effects from the increased dosage of medication would adversely affect his driving and work ability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The thyroid disease however would not prevent work at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Gordon's weight was an added risk but would not necessarily prevent him carrying out his duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The treatment to his toe nail was likely to give him somewhat restricted mobility for about two weeks from the procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Dr Payne's recommendation was in these terms:
 I would consider that due to his hypertension that he remains unfit for the full duties of the position at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The likelihood is that he will become fit for work with stabilization of his hypertension on appropriate medication, providing that there are no adverse effects on the duties from the medication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Continued loss of weight should have a positive effect on general health, well being and mobility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">His toe condition should respond to appropriate treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">38 On 4 June Dr Payne spoke by telephone to Mr Andrew Hunter of the ATO to "clarify the information and risks identified in the report".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mr Hunter noted Dr Payne as saying that due to the nature of the role as a GST Field Officer, the issues surrounding control of weight, blood pressure ("currently 'juggling'"), medication and their impact on driving, that if Dr Payne was employing him it would be for "office based but with modified duties due to health issues, medication etc".</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Medication had possible side effects and it would be a matter of trial to see which medication reacts best for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">As to the "time frame for fitness", Dr Payne said it was 
 unknown at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It has to do with personal approach to maintain weight loss, medication (etc) would be at least 1 month and possibly up to 6 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Dr Payne advised that he had spoken with Mr Gordon's doctor who "had no issues" with the assessment that there are risks regarding Mr Gordon's health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In Dr Payne's view it would only be worth reviewing again if Mr Gordon's doctor provided advice that health issues were stabilised, medication was not causing problems and weight loss was maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Dr Payne's advice was that Mr Gordon "is a risk" and was "not suited at this stage (due to health issues) for field work; even office based duties would need to be modified to minimise this risk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">39 Also on 4 June Mr Gordon telephoned Mr Hunter advising amongst other things his lower blood pressure reading of 150/88 taken by Dr Mee on 2 June.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">40 On the same day the ATO wrote to Mr Gordon stating that on the basis of the advice of the reassessment conducted by Dr Payne it had been concluded that "you are not medically fit for the duties outlined as an APS4 GST Field Officer Compliance operative".</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It was confirmed that the offer of employment had been formally withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">41 On 6 June Mr Gordon wrote to the ATO advising of his consultations with Dr Mee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Amongst other things he said that Dr Mee had found his blood pressure on 9 May to be 170/105 and on 2 June 150/88 and that Dr Mee's opinion on that date was 
 that while I was not fit for all the duties of the position I had applied for, I was fit to look for work and all that entails (applications, interviews etc).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">He also considered that I was fit to carry out all the normal duties required in an office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">42 In a report the following year dated 10 August 2004 Dr Mee confirmed his examination of Mr Gordon on 9 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">He stated he had made it clear to Mr Gordon that in providing a certificate stating he was "fit for sedentary work" and could drive a motor vehicle he was not expressing an opinion on his suitability for any specific employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In response to Mr Gordon's solicitors' enquiry whether on that day Mr Gordon was "fit to perform normal sedentary office duties and also to perform the tasks involved in procuring a job including travelling to appointments, preparing job applications and attending interviews" Dr Mee stated that he 
 agreed that he could perform tasks involving procuring a job etc as described in paragraph 2 of your letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">There was an expectation that he would follow treatment and management advice for his medical problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In conclusion Dr Mee said
 I do not and did not have an opinion on his suitability for any particular work position in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Treatment by Dr Cooper and Dr Bishop 
 
43 Mr Gordon consulted Dr Russell Cooper, a General Practitioner, who on 13 November 2003 wrote a letter of referral to Dr Warrick Bishop, a Cardiologist at the Calvary Cardiac Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Amongst other things Dr Cooper recorded blood pressure readings by Dr Mee and himself (see schedule).</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He noted that in his opinion, and that of Dr Mee and Dr McArdle, Mr Gordon was fit to work and drive a car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">44 Dr Cooper noted that Dr Payne's readings were a lot higher than the readings of Drs Mee, McArdle and himself around the same time which would suggest that Mr Cooper was "experiencing acute anxiety (white coat syndrome)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He found Dr Payne's view that Mr Gordon's improvement would be conditional on his experiencing no adverse effects from the medication "a bit perplexing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In Dr Cooper's view if there were side effects from medication it was not Mr Gordon's fault, rather the doctor's choice of medication and that it was the treating doctor's duty to find an anti-hypertension medication that is side effect free.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">45 Dr Bishop duly examined Mr Gordon on 26 November 2003 and sent Dr Cooper a report of the same date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">He enclosed an extract from Assessing Fitness to Drive: For Commercial and Private Vehicle Drivers, Medical Standards for Licensing and Clinical Management Guidelines published in September 2003 by the National Road Transport Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">These noted at p 44: 
 A person with hypertension consistently less than 200/110 (treated or untreated) may drive without license restriction and without notification to the DLA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">They should be reviewed by their treating doctor periodically regarding progression of the illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The criteria for an unconditional licence are NOT met 
 
 &#8226; If the person's sitting blood pressure is consistently 200/110 or greater (treated or untreated)... 
 
 
46 In Dr Bishop's view several measurements of a high blood pressure would be needed to ensure that one was not dealing with simply a white coat phenomenon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">If constantly elevated blood pressure had not been documented then by the guidelines it would seem that the patient would not be unfit to drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">If there were side effects from medication then this could interfere with driving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">47 Dr Bishop thought that the blood pressure needed to be documented on several occasions to confirm the diagnosis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Mr Gordon needed to be treated appropriately and shown to be tolerating the medication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">If he satisfied the criteria outlined in the fitness to drive guidelines, then there would be no reason for him not to drive and similarly he could see no reason why he would be unfit for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The time required for Mr Gordon to be sufficiently controlled from a hypertensive point of view was individual, although "it should have been able to be sorted out at most, within a couple of weeks".</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">
 
48 On 5 February 2004 Dr Bishop arranged an ambulatory blood test for Mr Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">This involved fitting a device which automatically records blood pressure readings over a 24 hour period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Dr Bishop sent a report to Dr Cooper dated 31 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He said that he was "pleased to see that this showed excellent blood pressure control over the 24 hour period".</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">He had reassured Mr Gordon and did not need to see him again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The total average was 111/70.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">49 Dr Bishop's evidence at the trial was that the normal range of blood pressure in an adult male is around 120/80 or 130/80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">On a 24 hour blood pressure monitor 140/85 would be acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">50 Dr Cooper replied to Dr Bishop in a letter dated 27 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The letter contains an analysis of the readings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The initial reading was 147/89 but then fell quite substantially over the 24 hour period with the average results "well within the normal range".</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Apparently on Mr Gordon's first visit to Dr Bishop his systolic reading was 185 but that fell immediately to 150 on retesting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">51 Dr Bishop's view in a report dated 30 April 2004 was that Mr Gordon had a "significant 'white coat' affect".</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He said that it was fairly common for patients' blood pressure readings to be spuriously raised when they were being tested by a doctor and that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was a more reliable means of testing blood pressure in a group of patients who have significant variability due to a white coat effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Dr Robinson's opinion 
 
52 The respondent tendered a report from Dr James Robinson, a Cardiologist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Surprisingly for an expert witness relied on in Tasmanian litigation, Dr Robinson practices in Claremont --- not the Hobart suburb but Claremont, Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">He did not examine Mr Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He reviewed various reports including those of Dr Payne, Dr Cooper and Dr Bishop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">He expressed the view that diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg was a medical emergency that required prompt investigation and treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">He would have admitted that person to hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Once the patient settled down in hospital the white coat effect would become less obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Tests should be conducted to exclude phaeochromocytoma and Conn's Syndrome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In the absence of those conditions the blood pressure could have been brought under control within a few days of aggressive management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Mr Gordon would have been strongly advised to lose weight and provided with dietary advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He noted that Mr Gordon had a past history of a nervous condition, most recently affecting him during a return flight to Australia after his father's death in Italy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Mr Gordon, Dr Robinson said, responded badly to emotional stress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Dr Robinson thought that there would be more stress in the GST job than "'the white coat effect' from well meaning medical staff".</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">He thought Mr Gordon's hypertension put him at risk of a heart attack or stroke, and his obesity put him at risk of developing diabetes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">He believed that 
 a major factor in improving his chance of longevity has been his exclusion from the stressful position as a GST Compliance Officer with the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">53 I am not persuaded that a Perth cardiologist can give any useful evidence about the stress or otherwise for somebody working as a GST Officer in the ATO office in Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">54 As to Dr Robinson's opinion about immediate hospital admission, Dr Bishop in cross-examination agreed that a reading of 110 had to be treated seriously, but in his 15 years of experience in managing high blood pressure he had not admitted a patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">This was because of the availability of more powerful oral medications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">55 I did not find Dr Robinson's report of much assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Did the respondent discriminate against Mr Gordon on the ground of a disability (s 5(1))?</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 
56 As already mentioned, hypertension is a disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The respondent, on the advice of Dr Payne, imputed this disability to Mr Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The comparator for the purposes of s 5(1) is a hypothetical person who does not have hypertension but has Mr Gordon's qualifications and experience and is applying for the position of a GST Field Officer in the Launceston office of the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">There can be no doubt that such a person would have got the job and would not have had the employment offer withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">By withdrawing the offer of employment the respondent has treated Mr Gordon less favourably than it would have treated such a hypothetical person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It did so because of the imputed condition of hypertension, which, it considered, made him unfit for the requirements of the particular position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The respondent thus discriminated against Mr Gordon, within the meaning of s 5(1): Purvis v New South Wales [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 217 CLR 92 at [213] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">57 I do not accept the respondent's argument that the offer was withdrawn, not because of Mr Gordon's hypertension, but because he failed to meet one of the pre-employment conditions, viz, that he be certified fit for the duties of the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">One cannot divorce the factual base from its legal characterisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Even if regard is had to the three other medical conditions mentioned by Dr Payne, there would still be discrimination because they are equally "disabilities" which would not be suffered by the comparator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">But viewed in a practical way, the inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the real and operative reason for withdrawing the offer was Mr Gordon's imputed hypertension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Did the respondent discriminate against Mr Gordon by dismissing him (s 15(2)(c))?</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">
 
58 The respondent contended that it did not dismiss Mr Gordon, rather that it withdrew a conditional offer of employment when the condition was not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">59 Anti-discrimination legislation is to be given a "fair, large and liberal" interpretation rather than one which is "literal or technical": IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1 at 12 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">From 28 April 2003 Mr Gordon was an "employee" of the respondent, however conditional the terms under which he was employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He attended at the ATO Launceston office, carried out such duties as were required of him (there is nothing to suggest the contrary) and received, or became entitled to receive, a wage or salary as long as he so attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">During the period he was at the office the respondent would have owed him the common law and statutory obligations which employers owe to their employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The respondent would have been liable to any third parties for torts committed by Mr Gordon in the course of his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Withdrawing an employment offer, in circumstances where Mr Gordon had already started work, and would have continued to work but for Mr Godden telling him to leave the premises that day, was within the concept of "dismissing" in s 15(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">60 Since s 15(1) make it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds of disability in "determining who should be offered employment" (par (b)) or "in the terms or conditions on which employment is offered" (par (c)), it would be strange if someone like Mr Gordon who had actually started work would be in a weaker position and would have no protection against discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">61 I reject the respondent's submission that Mr Gordon "commenced his employment under false pretences".</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The medical evaluation form ([18]-[20] above) made it clear that the doctor was not to decide whether Mr Gordon got the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The form was quite encouraging in holding out the prospect that, if any medical problems existed, their effect on employment could quite possibly be resolved to the satisfaction of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Mr Gordon was aware that Dr Payne would talk to the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Mr Gordon was not to know when this would happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">In the meantime, according to Mr Godden, Mr Gordon's commencing work was somewhat accelerated, apparently on the ATO's initiative, because the training program was about to commence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">62 I conclude therefore that Mr Gordon has made out a prima facie case of discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Before passing to the s 15(4) defence I should note that the Act does not require an intention or motive to discriminate; cf Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349 at 359 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J, with whom Deane J at 382 agreed, a case under comparable Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">There is nothing to suggest that Dr Payne, or Mr Godden and the other ATO officers, acted otherwise than in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Is actual or imputed disability the criterion for s 15(4)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">
 
63 In Power v Aboriginal Hostels Limited [2003] FCA 1475 ; (2003) 133 FCR 254 Selway J held that it is the imputed disability which is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">His Honour said at [15]-[18]:
 15 The next question is whether the appellant is unable to perform those duties 'because of his disability'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">That question was not addressed by the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In my view the failure to address that question was an appealable error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">If the question had been addressed then there are two possibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The first is that the 'imputed disorder' of depression is the relevant disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Alternatively, his actual condition of an adjustment disorder (from which he seems to have recovered) is the relevant disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">16 The appellant's submissions assumed that the relevant disability was the actual condition of the appellant at the time of his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">On that basis the appellant submitted that he could perform the inherent requirements of the position - indeed, he was doing so for the four weeks before his employment was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Consequently, he argued, s 15(4) of the DDA had no application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">17 On the other hand the respondent's submissions assumed that the relevant disability was the imputed disorder of depression, notwithstanding that the appellant was not suffering from that disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">On this basis the respondent argued that in light of the report of Dr Ducrou the appellant was unable to comply with the inherent duties of the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">18 So far as my research reveals, there is no authority directly on point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The definition of 'disability' in s 4 of the DDA purports to be an exhaustive definition, 'unless the contrary intention appears'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There is no obvious contrary intention disclosed by s 15(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Nor is there any obvious reason to imply one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The DDA is principally directed to the elimination as far as possible of 'discrimination against persons on the ground of disability' in relevant areas (s 3 DDA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It is not directed at achieving 'fair outcomes' as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Consequently what is prohibited is discriminatory behaviour based upon disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">'Imputed' disability is sufficient for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">What the DDA prohibited in this case was not the dismissal of the appellant for a reason which was wrong, but the dismissal of the appellant who had a disability (albeit an imputed one) in circumstances where a person without a disability would not have been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">When it is understood that the DDA is directed at the ground of discrimination (which includes imputed disability) and not 'fair outcomes' then there seems no reason to imply that 'disability' appearing in s 15(4) of the DDA does not include imputed disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">64 Additionally to his Honour's observations, it can be said that it is likely that the word "disability" wherever it appears in s 15(4) is referring to the same thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Where first appearing, "disability" is obviously referring to the discrimination alleged against the employer seeking to rely on the defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">If that discrimination was on the ground of imputed disability, then "disability" means imputed disability and the later expression "his or her disability" refers to the disability imputed to the employee alleging discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">65 Since s 15 as a whole is setting up a norm of conduct, it is to be read as addressed to employers as at the time they are contemplating potentially discriminatory conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Subsections (1) and (2) tell employers what they must not do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Subsections (3) and (4) tell them in what circumstances they may lawfully do what would otherwise amount to unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">This suggests that what subs (4) is concerned with are circumstances known to the employer at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">However, consistently with the philosophy of anti-discrimination legislation (see [58] above), the criterion is an objective one --- as is indicated by the reference to "all other factors that it is reasonable to take into account".</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The relevant circumstances include the nature of the imputed disability in the light of such medical investigation as may be reasonable and the availability of reasonable treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">What were the inherent requirements of the particular employment (s 15(4)(a))?</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 
66 Whether something is an "inherent requirement" of a particular employment depends on whether it is an essential element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The inherent requirements include at least the ability to carry out the physical tasks encompassed by the particular employment but also matters such as having regard for the safety of other employees, the general public and the employee himself: X v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 63 ; (1999) 200 CLR 177 at [31] - [35] per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">67 The requirements of the particular employment in question in the present case were described by Mr Godden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In 2003 GST Field Staff were organised into six teams, three each in Hobart and Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The Launceston teams were based at an ATO office in that city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The office was purely a GST Field Site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">No other ATO functions were performed at that site and there were no facilities for public contact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">When a taxpayer had to be seen, the officers would go out to the taxpayer's place of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">68 Launceston teams were expected to deal with clients in the North of the State down to Ross, on the North West Coast and in the North East down to Bicheno.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">69 All Launceston staff were involved in field work in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The work was a mixture of audit and advisory visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The latter would be in response to a taxpayer's request for a visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The Commissioner had given a public undertaking that the Office would contact the taxpayer within 72 hours of the initial request and complete the visit within 14 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">70 Management was trying to maximise field time with an aim of officers spending 80 per cent of their time in the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">As it turned out, in 2003 officers in Launceston spent about 40 to 50 per cent of their time in the field, the remainder being taken up with training, team meetings, leave etc. New APS 4 staff such as Mr Gordon would have to spend more time in the field than the average because their work would have required them to spend more time doing advisory visits than audits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">71 Field officers were issued with a laptop and printer totalling 6.5 kg together with miscellaneous information booklets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">72 Sometimes overnight stays were required in remote locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">73 Because so much work was done in the field there was a desk sharing arrangement in the office, ie one desk between four officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">74 The foregoing description is, however, subject to the particular requirements of the training or induction period for Mr Gordon and other officers starting with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The period was, as already mentioned, to commence on 28 April 2003 and extend over a period of sixteen weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">As Mr Godden deposed, the training period "was not all office based".</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">But that rather suggests that, in contradistinction to the post-training regime, work outside the office would be the exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">This inference is strengthened by the detail Mr Godden provides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He deposed:
 Training commenced on 28 April 2003 and on 20 May 2003 the trainees were required to travel to Hobart to undertake training until the 22 May and return for further training in Launceston on 23 May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The following week they were then required to undertake training out in the field for one day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The following week they had two days of field training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">And the following week three days in the field for training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The field work during their training period could have been anywhere in the North of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">It depended entirely on where the cases were located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">75 Thus virtually the whole of the first month was to be spent in Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">This is confirmed by the timetable for the training program (exhibit AH).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">For the rest of the training period, field trips appear in the program as "Buddy Days".</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">As might be expected, trainees would not be sent into the field alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Mr Gordon would not necessarily have had to drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">76 I find that the requirements of the particular employment in this case, apart from the training period, included the ability to drive a motor vehicle frequently and sometimes for substantial distances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The suggestion that somebody in Mr Gordon's position could travel to places like Smithton and Ringarooma by bus or taxi is quite fanciful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">However, the position during the training period was significantly different, as discussed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">It seems likely that Mr Gordon could have managed for that period without driving at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Would Mr Gordon be unable to carry out these inherent requirements (s 15(4)(a))?</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">
 
77 The onus is on the respondent to make out this defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It is plain that, as revealed by the ambulatory testing, Mr Gordon has been dramatically affected by white coat syndrome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">His average reading revealed by such testing in February 2004 was 111/70 although of course it does not necessarily follow that Mr Gordon's true blood pressure in May 2003 was the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">But Dr Payne accepted in cross-examination that as at 22 April 2003 he recognised that Mr Gordon might be suffering a white coat effect, and that his underlying blood pressure may have been well below what he recorded in the surgery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">78 As to fitness for driving, Dr Payne, at the time he examined Mr Gordon, was not aware of the induction program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He accepted in cross-examination that by 13 May 2003 if Mr Gordon was not doing extensive driving he would have considered him fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">When the facts of the induction program were put to him, Dr Payne agreed that it did not involve extensive driving, particularly if Mr Gordon was getting a lift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">79 Dr Bishop expressed the following opinions: 
 
 
 &#8226; Up to 30 per cent of elevated clinical blood pressure measurements are attributable to white coat syndrome;
 &#8226; Mr Gordon suffered significant white coat effect;
 &#8226; An ambulatory test in May 2003 would have resulted in a white coat diagnosis and Mr Gordon would have been assessed as fit for driving;
 &#8226; It would be "extremely uncommon for people not to be able to drive or continue with their job due to medication issues".</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">
 

80 Dr Bishop's view as to the time needed to bring high blood pressure under control was in these terms: 
 Apart from the thiazide diuretics which can take several weeks to work, the other main groups of anti-hypertensives we use have an immediate effect which builds up as blood levels increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">For the orally dosed medications that are routinely used, one would think that dosing over a period of five half-lives (roughly five days for most these medications) would provide substantial blood pressure effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">To that end, one would normally hope to get at least moderate control of the blood pressure within a matter of weeks and then finer control of blood pressure beyond that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">81 Objectively considered, as at May 2003 the circumstances reasonably apparent were:
 
&#8226; It was at least possible Mr Gordon was affected by white coat syndrome and might have had a significantly lower underlying blood pressure than that found by Dr Payne;
 
&#8226; It was likely that ambulatory testing would have revealed a lower blood pressure;
 
&#8226; In any event, any elevated blood pressure which Mr Gordon suffered could have been brought under satisfactory control well before the time he would have been required to engage in extensive driving alone in his ATO work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">82 The respondent has not established that Mr Gordon, by reason of his imputed (or indeed actual) hypertension would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">It is therefore not necessary to consider questions under s 15(4)(b) as to the "services or facilities" that would be required and any "unjustifiable hardship" on the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">It can be said, however, that during the training period organising a lift for Mr Gordon to Hobart and return on 22 May 2003 and ensuring that his "buddies" would drive on subsequent training trips would not have imposed any unjustifiable hardship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Relief claimed 
 
83 Mr Gordon seeks:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">A declaration under s 46PO(4)(a) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat such discrimination;
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Reinstatement;
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Compensation for loss in connection with the purchase of a house in Launceston;
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Compensation for past and future loss of salary and superannuation;
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Compensation for mental anguish;
 
6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Interest;
 
7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Declaration 
 
84 It is appropriate to make the declaration sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">However, I see no need for an order directing the respondent not to repeat such unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">As explained below, there will be no order for reinstatement, so it is unlikely that there will be any opportunity for discrimination against Mr Gordon in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The discrimination which occurred was not motivated by any animus on the part of the ATO towards Mr Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">There is no reason to suspect that in general the ATO is unaware of its obligations under anti-discrimination legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Reinstatement 
 
85 Mr Gordon seeks an order under s 46PO(4)(b) of the HREOC Act requiring the respondent to withdraw the termination of his employment and retrospectively reinstate him to a position within the ATO at APS 4 level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">86 The rather complicated background to this issue is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">At the time of the trial Mr Gordon was employed by the Retirement Benefits Fund, a statutory body which manages the superannuation of Tasmanian State Government employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">He worked in a call centre answering queries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">After the evidence was completed, but before the written final submissions had been concluded (there were no oral final submissions), Mr Gordon applied for a position at the RBF as a Para Planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">This is a kind of apprenticeship position which can lead on to appointment as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Mr Gordon has two remaining subjects to complete in order to satisfy the requirements for the professional qualifications for financial planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">87 On 29 February 2008 Mr Gordon's solicitors wrote to the Court and the respondent's solicitor advising that Mr Gordon had been successful in obtaining an appointment with the RBF as a Para Planner, commencing 10 March 2008, on a salary of $45,414 gross per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The maximum salary payable could increase to $50,865 gross per annum after another five increment points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The maximum level payable on the currently held position was $47,218 after another two increment points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The solicitors advised that Mr Gordon no longer sought reinstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">88 On 19 March Mr Gordon's solicitors wrote to the Court foreshadowing an application to make further submissions and possibly call further evidence on the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">89 On 20 March the respondent's solicitor wrote advising that the respondent also would possibly wish to call further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">90 On 1 April Mr Gordon's solicitors wrote advising that Mr Gordon now asked for retrospective reinstatement to the ATO, as originally sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">They were no longer instructed to make further submissions or present further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">91 At a directions hearing on 22 April the respondent sought leave to call further evidence from an actuary in the light of Mr Gordon's disclosure of his new employment position with RBF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">I refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">I intimated that I would rely on what was said in the letter of 29 February as to Mr Gordon's current employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Counsel accepted this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">92 I do not propose to make an order for reinstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Five years have passed since Mr Gordon left the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">He now has permanent employment of his own choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">According to Mr Godden, the position Mr Gordon had been offered at ATO in Launceston was not refilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">In 2003 GST "as a business line" began contracting in numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">In the Victoria/Tasmania region only positions in metropolitan sites were filled, due to decreasing work demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Staff working in the remote sites such as Launceston were not replaced if they left and work targets for those "losing sites" were reduced so that there were enough staff at the relevant levels to undertake the required work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">93 "Particular employment" means the actual employment the relevant employee was required to perform pursuant to his contract of employment, not the general status of an employee in the employer's organisation: Cosma v Qantas Airways Ltd [2002] FCA 640 ; (2002) 124 FCR 504.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Today the particular employment from which Mr Gordon was dismissed no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">House purchase 
 
94 On 1 May 2003 Mr Gordon entered into a contract to purchase a house at 9 Denis Drive, Riverside (a suburb of Launceston) for $142,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">He paid a deposit of $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Settlement was due on 13 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">The contract was subject to Westpac Bank making available a mortgage to secure a loan of $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">95 After the ATO terminated his employment Mr Gordon advised Westpac accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Because he then failed the bank's income test the loan application was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">An alternative buyer was found for the property in June or July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Mr Gordon's deposit was retuned, but he claims the following losses:
 Legal fees $476.52 Surveying fees $250.00 Building Inspection $330.00 Credit Card Fee $62.56 Total $1,089.08 

In addition he claims a loss of value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The property was valued by Brothers &amp; Newton Pty Ltd of Launceston in May 2007, as at May 2003, at $250,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Apparently there was a real estate boom in Launceston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">96 Mr Gordon said he bought the house because he "felt it was an essential part of making a full commitment to the job".</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">He was also spending money to stay in a hotel without any support from the ATO and returned to Hobart (where he owned another house) at weekends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">He was told by agents that the market was "red hot".</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">At the time he signed the contract he was aware of his high blood pressure reading but saw the risk of losing the job as "just so remote".</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">97 There was a considerable amount of cross-examination about the financial viability of the purchase, given Mr Gordon's existing mortgage over his Hobart property, and whether it was feasible to let part of the Launceston property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">98 However, I do not think any amount in relation to the house purchase is properly allowable as damages by way of compensation for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct of the respondent: s 46PO(4)(d) of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">There is no suggestion that the ATO was aware of, let alone encouraged, this purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Any loss, either by way of out of pocket expenses or loss of a chance to make a profitable investment, arose from Mr Gordon's rather precipitate decision to purchase and cannot, as a matter of commonsense, be attributed to the discriminatory conduct of the ATO: cf March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12 ; (1991) 171 CLR 506.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Salary and superannuation 
 
99 At the time of his termination Mr Gordon's ATO gross salary was $42,351.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">100 Following his termination he applied for the following positions;
 22 June 2003 Deloittes --- Tax Analyst 30 March 2004 Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees --- position not advised 30 March 2004 Shadforths Stockbrokers --- Financial Advisor Assistance/Planner 30 March 2004 Commonwealth Bank --- Financial Planner 30 March 2004 SMF Funds Management --- Office Administrator 1 April 2004 RBF --- Cadet, Investments 1 April 2004 RBF --- Superannuation Administrator 

 
101 As already noted, he obtained the last position with RBF and has been employed there ever since, more recently as a Para Planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">102 Mr Gordon claims past economic loss being the difference between what he has earned and what he would have earned at the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The figures (net of tax) to 30 June 2007 are:
 ATO $158,538 Actual $101,101 Loss $57,437 

I have not been given any figures for the current financial year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The current APS 4 salary, assuming a salary in the middle of the band, is approximately $44,000 net.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">His current salary net would be approximately $37,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The difference is $7,000 per annum or $5,830 for the 10 months of the current financial year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Adding that figure to the figure for the period to 30 June 2007 gives a result of $63,267.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Gordon's damages will include that figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Since all the calculations are on a net basis I believe it will not be necessary to gross up to allow for any tax payable by Mr Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Should it be necessary, however, I would receive further submissions on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">103 In 2003 and 2004 Mr Gordon received $8030 from Centrelink which he will be obliged to repay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">This amount will be included in his damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">104 The future loss is problematical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">At the outset, it must be noted that, unlike the typical common law claim, this is not a claim for loss of earning capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">It is not alleged that what I have found to be the unlawful termination of employment had any effect on Mr Gordon's physical or mental capacity to earn income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Mr Gordon's case is based on the loss of a hypothetical career with the ATO leading to retirement at 55, 60 or 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">He postulates three possible levels, "Pessimistic", "Expected" and "Optimistic".</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">On the most optimistic scenario, he ends up as an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation based in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">105 Both sides called actuarial witnesses, Mr Morley for Mr Gordon and Mr Byrne for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">There was little, if any, dispute between those gentlemen as to the methodology of calculation including such matters as discount rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The real problem is the validity of the assumptions underlying Mr Gordon's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">106 Assessing what is likely to happen in the future, or would be likely to have happened had not something intervened, is not a matter of scientific demonstration or proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Nor, unlike findings as to alleged past events, is it a case of all or nothing; 51 per cent probability win, 49 per cent probability lose: Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 643.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Nevertheless, the circumstances in the present case make it extremely unlikely that Mr Gordon, had it not been for the termination in May 2003, would have pursued a successful career with the ATO until retirement, let alone at the level he suggests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">107 First, without wishing to be hurtful to Mr Gordon, the inescapable fact is that, for whatever reason, he is not a high achiever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">On paper his qualifications are considerable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He has an honours economics degree and an MBA from good universities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">He is a qualified accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">He has almost finished financial planning qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Yet the positions he has occupied up until now could be characterised as occupying a rank and salary towards the lower end of mid-level clerical/professional jobs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Professional men or women in their mid-forties should be at or approaching their peak in terms of earnings and professional status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">If they haven't got very far by this stage, things are unlikely to improve to any significant extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">108 Secondly, in the past Mr Gordon has not displayed any particular enthusiasm for a career in taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">He did not persist with the ATO in his earlier career (see [14] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Perhaps more importantly, in his recent job applications, both in the public and private sectors ([100] above), only one was tax-related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The rest appear to have been for employment in the funds management industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">109 Thirdly, and connected to the last point, it seems that if Mr Gordon was truly interested in a long term career in tax he would have been better off in the private sector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">110 Mr Byrne was Managing Principal of one of Tasmania's largest accounting firms from 2001 until 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">He said that in Tasmania it was quite difficult to find good qualified staff at all levels and for some firms this was still the case during 2007, particularly for experienced taxation staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">His firm employed staff from South Australia to fill vacancies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">111 In Mr Byrne's opinion, which was not seriously challenged, as a CPA with an MBA and at least five years in taxation services, given the shortage of tax professionals in Tasmania, Mr Gordon should have been readily employable with a career and salary prospects which could have at least matched if not well exceeded his expected career with the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">He could have expected a long career with one of Tasmania's larger accounting firms, that is to say ones with 25 plus staff (which I take to mean professional staff).</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">A salary survey referred to by Mr Byrne included the following:
 Taxation consultant, 6 plus years experience $50,000-72,000 Manager, 2-5 years experience $55,000-95,000 Director $90,000-140,000 

Many firms would pay bonuses of up to six weeks additional salary and directors could expect as much as 50 per cent of their base salary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">112 Mr Byrne prepared a table which compares Mr Gordon's earnings if he had followed a career as a taxation consultant compared to his hypothetical "expected" (ie the middle one of his scenarios) career with the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It included the following:
 
 To age 55 To age 60 To age 65 Future loss (101,653) (226,980) (345,183) Superannuation loss 73,104 76,240 16,840 Total loss (benefit) (28,549) (150,740) (328,343) 

 
113 I am not satisfied that Mr Gordon has made out a case for any loss or damage by way of loss of future salary or superannuation caused by the unlawful termination of his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Mental anguish 
 
 114 Mr Gordon claims damages for mental anguish due to the conduct of the respondent causing him "enormous grief and anxiety".</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">115 He said that he had
 suffered substantially on an emotional level as a result of what the ATO has done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">This has manifested as an enormous amount of grief and anxiety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Losing the house I bought in Launceston also broke me up enormously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">116 He provided a list of 30 "details" of this anxiety, which include:
 (e) the humiliation of having to deal with work colleagues when gathering my things to leave work, (f) driving back to Hobart that night in a state of grief and shock... (g) attending my doctor the following day to find out what the exact details of the examining doctor's decision were... (i) visiting the examining doctor a second time in a state of complete anxiety and finding that my blood pressure was still extremely elevated and trying to convince the examining doctor to talk to my GP about the issue, (j) having to ring the real estate agent, lawyer and bank who were handling the purchase to advise them that I had been sacked from my job (just telling these people what had happened was extremely hard and humiliating).</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Asking the lawyer to ask the seller to give me an extension of time to sort things out... (k) telling my family (especially my father who lives in Italy on the telephone) and many of my friends (some female friends still not told) what had happened was also extremely difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I had to do this over a few months (and am still doing it) as I was simply unable to deal with it any sooner, ... (m) waiting three weeks in a state of limbo before finally contacting the ATO to find out what the situation was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">No response had been received from the doctor, (n) visiting three different doctors on multiple occasions during this time, desperately trying to determine the status of my health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Having multiple blood pressure readings being performed also exacerbated my anxiety, ... (q) calling the Delegate in a state of stress at 1 a.m. in the morning to leave a message on his answering machine asking him not to send the (termination) letter as I considered it would breach the Disability Discrimination Act , ... (v) being rung up by the ATO and told that they had lost the second medical report... (bb) stress of investigating the case myself and preparing a large number of documents has also been extremely difficult emotionally, (cc) I have also suffered emotionally from the financial pressures that the situation has continued to place on me... (dd) I have a fairly nervous disposition and suffered from an episode of anxiety and depression around eight years ago resulting in me requiring three months off work on sick leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">This whole affair has certainly placed unusual stress upon me causing me many sleepless nights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">I have also spend numerous hours in the daytime obsessing over the circumstances of my life and wasted large amounts of time and nervous energy in this pursuit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">117 In addition, Mr Gordon lists four "other effects on personal life", including:
 (b) I have also felt unable to take women out as I feel at some stage they would need to know the present circumstances in my life which I have been unwilling to divulge, ... (d) Applying for the dole and applying for new jobs has also been humiliating and seemingly unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Carrying out work for the dole obligations has also been required during this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">118 Mr Gordon's oral evidence was that he "suffered extreme amounts of anxiety as a result of the decision and the determination to fix the matter which I saw as unjust" but that he did not seek medical treatment for that anxiety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">119 Since, for the reasons already explained, the cancellation of the purchase of the Launceston house is not a basis for compensation, I exclude so much of the foregoing as relates to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Nevertheless, I accept that Mr Gordon has suffered substantial mental anguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Perhaps he does not have a particularly stoic makeup, but, to apply the aphorism of the common law, the unlawful discriminator must take the plaintiff as it finds him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">120 A job, which one has sought and obtained on one's merits, gives meaning and purpose to life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">It is an essential part of one's self worth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">If it is lost as a result of someone's unlawful conduct then compensation ought to reflect the loss that is suffered, quite apart from economic considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">121 Under this heading I would award Mr Gordon $20,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Interest 
 
122 Mr Gordon claims, and is entitled to, interest up to judgment under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">The claim under the HREOC Act is, inter alia, a claim for "the recovery of ... money (including ... damages)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">123 The amount of the award is $91,297 made up as follows:
 Past salary loss $63,267 Centrelink $8,030 Mental anguish $20,000 Total $91,297 

 
124 The usual practice in the Federal Court is to adopt the rate of interest applied by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Federal Court is considering the matter: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">The current rate prescribed under rule 5A of the Supreme Court Rules 2000 (Tas) is 10.5 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">125 The award for lost salary is for money lost progressively over the last five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">I will allow the 10.5 per cent on roughly half that amount, say $30,000, for five years, ie $15,750.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">The remainder of the award, $28,030, represents compensation for loss incurred five years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Interest on that component will be $14,715.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Total interest amounts to $30,465.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Costs 
 
126 The parties requested leave to make submissions as to costs after reasons were delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">There will be a direction that within seven days of delivery of judgment the applicant file and serve submissions as to costs, the respondent file and serve submissions seven days thereafter and the applicant file and serve any reply within seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Costs will be decided on the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-six (126) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
