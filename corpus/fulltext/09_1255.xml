 INTRODUCTION 
 Kart racing and the AKA
 The first respondent, the Australian Karting Association (NSW) Incorporated ('AKA') is an incorporated association formed by various individual kart racing clubs in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory ('AKA clubs').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Kart racing is a specialised motor sport and has its own licensing regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">There are two types of kart racing --- sprint and endurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Sprint kart racing is predominantly conducted by karts with two stroke engines and endurance races are conducted by karts with four stroke engines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Kart racing is generally conducted on bitumen kart racing circuits ('kart circuit').</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Motorcar racing circuits are generally unsuitable for kart racing due to the length and layout of the circuits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The AKA's principal activity is to promote, co-ordinate and administer all aspects of the sport of karting in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It issues karting licences to individual drivers who belong to AKA clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This is the principal source of the AKA's revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The AKA does not own any kart circuit or supply any kart circuit hire services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It has a number of part-time and casual employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The AKA clubs and the respondents
 The AKA clubs include clubs formed around a kart circuit in a particular location and which conduct sprint kart racing series, other karting clubs which do not manage a track but still conduct sprint kart racing series, The Endurance Kart Racing Association ('TEKA') and Vintage and Historic Karts Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There are approximately 15 kart circuits which are managed by AKA clubs in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In addition, there are approximately 7 kart circuits owned or managed by non-AKA members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">AKA clubs are allowed to conduct 10 race meetings a year, with one meeting as a signature race for the club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Each of the AKA clubs which is formed around a kart circuit in a particular location manages that kart circuit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It will use that kart circuit to conduct its sprint kart racing series and can hire it to other users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Other AKA clubs which do not manage a kart circuit must hire the use of a kart circuit to conduct their sprint kart racing series.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">TEKA conducts endurance kart races which are held at various kart circuits throughout New South Wales, Queensland and Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">To hold these events, TEKA must hire the use of a kart circuit managed by members of AKA or at tracks managed by private operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The second, third, fourth and fifth respondents ('respondent clubs') are clubs that form part of the AKA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Each of the respondent clubs is a sporting club run by volunteers which conducts kart racing events, organises sprint kart racing series and hires out kart circuits located at different regions in New South Wales as the name suggests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Manning Valley Kart Club Inc hires out the kart circuit located in Wingham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The sixth and seventh respondents were officers of the AKA at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">At the relevant times, the sixth respondent, Mr Erdmann, was the President of the AKA and also the President of the national Australian Karting Association and a life member of the Wollongong Kart Club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Erdmann has resigned as President of the AKA effective from 12 October 2009 and is also no longer president of the national Australian Karting Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The seventh respondent, Mr Whiting, was a member of the executive of the AKA, the Vice President of the national Australian Karting Association and a life member of the Wollongong Kart Club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Neither Mr Erdmann nor Mr Whiting received any remuneration for the work they undertook as officers of the AKA, the national Australian Karting Association or the Wollongong Kart Club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Erdmann is an engineer and Mr Whiting is a salesman in industrial lighting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Non-AKA members
 There are other bodies not members of the AKA, such as Prokart Pty Limited ('Prokart') and the Australian Bracket Racing Association ('ABRA'), which manage kart circuits or organise kart racing series.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Prokart manages a kart circuit in Wollongong called the Wollongong City Raceway and runs approximately 50 kart races each year at venues across New South Wales, ACT and Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">ABRA hosts race events at the Butterfly Farm Indy 800 track in Windsor and at other circuits around New South Wales and Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Both of these bodies have hired venues from AKA clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">There are approximately 20 kart circuits in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory suitable for Prokart's racing events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Prior to July 2008, Prokart had hired kart circuits from different AKA clubs and had held races at each of those kart circuits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">On those occasions prior to July 2008, Prokart negotiated hire terms and conditions individually with each kart circuit operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">A venue suitable for kart racing must be a kart circuit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The parties agree that there is a market in the New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory for the supply of kart circuit hiring services ('kart circuit market').</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The present proceedings
 By these proceedings the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('ACCC') alleges contraventions of s 45 of the Competition Code of New South Wales ('the Code') for conduct engaged in between 19 July and 12 August 2008 by the AKA and the respondent clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Commission also alleges that Mr Erdmann and Mr Whiting were knowingly concerned in or party to particular contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Each of the respondents admits the conduct referred to in the declarations contained in the short minutes of order proposed by consent of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The parties made joint submissions in relation to those proposed orders and submitted a statement of agreed facts setting out the conduct which, it is agreed, amounted to the alleged contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">RELEVANT CONDUCT AND ADMITTED CONTRAVENTIONS 
 The AKA General Meeting on 19 July 2008
 On 19 July 2008 the AKA held a General Meeting at the Panthers Football Club in Sydney ('the AGM').</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Present in person were representatives of 19 different AKA clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Dubbo Kart Club had a representative in attendance for part of the AGM but that representative left the meeting before the passage of the resolution containing the understanding complained of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There were six further AKA clubs which gave proxies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Of the AKA clubs represented in person, ten clubs managed their own kart circuits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The AGM was chaired by Mr Erdmann.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There was a transcript of the AGM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">During the AGM, Mr Whiting and Mr Erdmann participated in a discussion amongst the representatives of the AKA clubs in attendance at the AGM about fixing the fees charged by AKA clubs to non-AKA members for the supply of kart circuit hire services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The transcript of the AGM records that this agenda item was first raised by Simon Whiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Mr Whiting introduced the subject of the fees which AKA clubs had charged non-AKA members for hire of kart circuits, as compared to what Prokart charged Wollongong Kart Club for hire of the Wollongong City Raceway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Whiting stated that: 
 
 ...if we had a schedule of fees, because different clubs can charge different amounts, I think that would go a long way, so that we have an agreed schedule of fees for the circuits if anyone wants to use them... 
 

 
Then later:
 
 
 I think the state office would be, would be quite happy to negotiate on, on your behalf and then forward any monies through without any cost to the club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 

 Mr Erdmann then addressed the meeting: 
 
 I would say to you what Simon's asking is that we do two things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">One is to set a minimum fee that anybody is going to charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">That way you are not competing amongst yourselves, right, for this person who continually wants to drive down your price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 

 
 And:
 
 
 if everyone sets a fee and agrees not to go below that figure, right, then at least the club is going to get some recompense for what they're doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 

 
 And:
 
 
 I think a place to start is to set a minimum fee, the second thing is to do, anything to do with kart racing on the circuit, right, like outside individuals wanting to race karts on kart circuits, should be handled by the State office... 
 

 Subsequently, Gayle Murphy, the person representing the Wagga Kart Club at the AGM moved: 
 
 We set a fee of $4000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 

 
 Ms Murphy subsequently added:
 
 
 Plus GST if you charge it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 

 Mr Erdmann then accepted further amendments from unidentified representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">As recorded in the minutes of the meeting, the final form of the motion ('the Resolution') was: 
 
 All applications/negotiations are to be handled by the State Office for any AKA NSW licenced circuit that is to be used for kart racing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The minimum fee is $4,000 plus GST per day for country clubs and $6,000 plus GST per day for metropolitan clubs and Canberra Kart Racing Club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 

 The transcript records the passage of the motion as follows: 
 
 Mr Erdman: All those in favour of the motion?</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Oppose the motion?</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Any abstentions to the motion?</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The motion is carried unanimous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 

 The respondents admit that by passing the Resolution, the AKA and each of the 19 AKA clubs whose representatives were present at the AGM for the passage of the Resolution made a contract or arrangement or arrived at an understanding ('the Understanding') containing the following provisions: 
(a) Each of the AKA clubs with kart circuits would not offer to supply, and would not supply, kart circuit hire services at a price less than a fee of $4,000 plus GST per day for country clubs and $6,000 plus GST per day for metropolitan clubs ('Minimum Hire Fee'); and
 
(b) Any negotiations for the supply of kart circuit hire services would be conducted by the AKA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Two or more parties to the Understanding, including: 
(a) Manning Valley Kart Club,
 
(b) Wagga Kart Club, and
 
(c) Newcastle Kart Club,
 
supplied kart circuit hire services, in competition with each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The parties agree, and I accept, that the provisions of the Understanding: 
(a) had the purpose or the effect or were likely to have the effect of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, the price for kart circuit hire services supplied by AKA clubs with kart circuits to customers or prospective customers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, within the meaning of s 45A of the Code; and
 
(b) by reason of the matters set out in paragraph 22 and subparagraph 23(a) above, are deemed to have the purpose or the effect, or to be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the Kart Circuit Market, for the purposes of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">By making the Understanding, each of: 
(a) the AKA,
 
(b) Wagga Kart Club,
 
(c) Newcastle Kart Club, and
 
(d) Manning Valley Kart Club
 
admits they have contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The parties agree, and I accept, that the purpose or a substantial purpose of the provisions of the Understanding was to prevent, restrict or limit one or more of the following: 
(a) the supply by AKA clubs with kart circuits of kart circuit hire services to any kart series operator who is not an AKA member on condition that the customer pay at least the Minimum Hire Fee; and
 
(b) the acquisition by any kart race series operator who is not an AKA member of kart circuit hire services from AKA clubs with kart circuits on condition that the customer pay at least the Minimum Hire Fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The provision of the Understanding set out in paragraph 21(a) was an exclusionary provision within the meaning of s 4D of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">By making the Understanding, each of: 
(a) the AKA,
 
(b) Wagga Kart Club,
 
(c) Newcastle Kart Club, and
 
(d) Manning Valley Kart Club
 
admits they have contravened s 45(2)(a)(i) of the Code.</sentence>

<sentence id="s119">I am satisfied that in each case those contraventions have been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">PENALTY 
 Legal principles and relevant factors
 Although the present proceedings concern contraventions of the Code only, the Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) which confers original jurisdiction on the Federal Court in proceedings where the Commonwealth seeks an injunction or declaration (similarly to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v White Top Taxis Ltd [2009] FCA 88 ; (2009) 253 ALR 449).</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The principles for assessing penalty under the Code are the same as under the TPA ( White Top Taxis at [20] per Finkelstein J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Section 76 of the Code sets out certain matters as relevant matters to which the Court should have regard in determining an appropriate pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The parties in the joint submissions referred to further relevant factors addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-52,153 and expanded upon in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The parties also recognise that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence ( NW Frozen Foods ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As elaborated, the concept of deterrence is to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act ( TPC v CSR at 52,125 per French J), or to deter others who might be tempted to think that contravention would be of benefit and detection would lead merely to a compliance program for the future ( NW Frozen Foods at 294---295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The need to achieve general deterrence as well as specific deterrence means that a party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] per Goldberg J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It is noteworthy that, in the present case, the participants were totally ignorant that their actions constituted contraventions of the Code and thus they had no intention to contravene the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">There is no suggestion that any of these parties will re-offend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Bearing in mind the process as set out by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 for the assessment of criminal sanctions where penalties are not fixed by statute, the ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 imposed on the AKA is appropriate and within the range of penalties that a Court would order in these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The parties point out that in considering the proposed agreed penalty, the Court should take into account the fact that a negotiated resolution may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The imposition of penalty is a matter for the Court ( NW Frozen Foods at 290) and the assessment of the appropriate penalty involves exercising a discretion taking into account all relevant factors ( Markarian at [27]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">However, the parties submit that the Court should not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure except in a clear case ( NW Frozen Foods at 291, approved and explained in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993).</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Some of the relevant factors that I have taken into account in the present case include: I note also that, as French J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [18] , it is not sufficient, in making a consent order, that it is within the power of the Court to make the order nor that the parties have privately agreed as to the proposed order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">As to the specific matters relevant in the present case, the parties have made submissions on: the nature and extent of the contravening conduct; the amount of loss or damage caused; the circumstances in which the conduct took place; similar conduct in the past --- whether the contravener has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct; the size of the contravening company; the degree of power the contravening company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; whether the contravention arose out of conduct of senior management or at a lower level; whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Code, as evidenced by compliance programs and corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Code in relation to the contravention; the financial position of the respondents; the deterrent effect of the proposed penalty; and totality and parity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Application of the principles
 The nature and extent of the contravening conduct
 The Understanding was reached at the AGM of the AKA, a sporting association whose members are kart racing associations based in NSW and the ACT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Mr Erdmann and Mr Whiting participated in a discussion amongst the representatives of the AKA clubs in attendance at the AGM, that discussion leading to the motion being proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The members voted and passed the Resolution which gave rise to the understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The understanding was given effect to on three occasions when Prokart received quotes from the AKA regarding the hire of kart circuits on which to hold its race series.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The conduct ceased once the AKA became aware of the ACCC investigation and the possible contravention of the Code, which was less than three months after the Resolution was passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Resolution was subsequently revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The amount of loss or damage caused
 As with many Part IV contraventions, any loss or damage which resulted from the conduct is difficult to quantify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The ACCC submits that on three occasions, Prokart lost the opportunity of hiring, at a rate set competitively, tracks which it felt best met its requirements and that of its customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Prokart did not ultimately hire any tracks at the rates set by the Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The respondents submit that the loss or damage was nil or, at worst, nominal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There is no evidence of any actual loss or damage suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The circumstances in which the conduct took place
 The discussion which took place during the AGM prior to the making of the Understanding suggests that the Understanding was probably made by the AKA and its constituent members as a response to the activities of Prokart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Prokart conducts a business arranging kart racing series.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The conduct was not clandestine or covert and took place at a meeting of a sporting body of modest size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The corporate respondents are run almost exclusively by persons without legal training, who give their time for no remuneration to assist in the development of the kart racing sport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The individual respondents receive no remuneration for their services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">There is substantial participation in the sport by children and teenagers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The imposition of more significant sanctions than those proposed would act as a significant disincentive for others to volunteer their time to sporting and other activities which are of benefit to society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The contravening conduct occurred as a result of ignorance of the prohibitions contained in the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Similar conduct in the past --- whether the contravener has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct
 The respondents have not been found to have engaged in any contraventions of the Code in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The size of the contravening company
 The AKA's annual turnover, based on total income, for the financial year ending 30 June 2008 was $644,551.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Its annual turnover for the financial year ending 30 June 2007 was $614,378.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">For the financial year ending 30 June 2007, the AKA made a profit of $2,773.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">For the financial year ending 30 June 2008, the AKA had an operating loss of $10,082.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">This left it with reserves of $171,141 as at 30 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The degree of power the contravening company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market
 The AKA does not own any kart circuit or supply any kart circuit hire services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The second to fifth respondents each manage and hire out a kart circuit, being four of the twenty two kart circuits available for hire in NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Other AKA clubs manage and hire a further 11 tracks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The ACCC submits that, cumulatively, they could exercise significant market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended
 The conduct was deliberate but of only a short duration, essentially only until the AKA became aware that their conduct was likely to be in contravention of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The conduct occurred because the respondents and the other AKA clubs who were party to the Understanding did not know that they were engaging in conduct in breach of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Whether the contravention arose out of conduct of senior management or at a lower level
 The contravening conduct occurred with the knowledge of the then President of the AKA, Mr Erdmann.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Code, as evidenced by compliance programs and corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention
 At the time the contravening conduct occurred, the AKA had not given staff trade practices training, nor had it implemented any trade practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Code in relation to the contravention
 The respondents have continued to co-operate fully with the ACCC during its investigation and in the course of these proceedings, including by providing information and documents when requested by the ACCC and by making the admissions set out in the statement of agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">As a result, the penalties submitted to the Court as appropriate are discounted in the order of 50% from the penalties which would have been submitted by the ACCC as appropriate, absent such co-operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The financial position of the respondents
 As noted above, the AKA has sufficient reserves to pay the proposed penalty, although it has limited financial resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The deterrent effect of the proposed penalty
 Given the essentially voluntary nature of the AKA, a penalty of this size, together with the institution of these proceedings is likely to have a significant deterrent effect upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It will also make a clear statement to other sporting organisations in a similar position to the AKA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Totality and parity
 The ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that the imposition upon the AKA of a single total penalty of $10,000, in respect of all contraventions, is appropriate having regard to the totality principle as outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Declarations
 The declarations sought in the proposed orders are sought pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The parties submit that the proposed declarations, in a convenient and abbreviated form, sufficiently identify the contravening conduct ( Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [89] ---[90]) and thereby provide context for the pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Accordingly, the parties submit the declarations operate with the pecuniary penalties to achieve the objective of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the declarations in the form sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Injunctions
 Each of the respondents has consented to the imposition of injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The injunctions are available pursuant to s 80 of the Code and are in the nature of public interest injunctions ( ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 255 to 256 per Lockhart J; Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (2000) 200 CLR 591 at 602 per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">There is no suggestion that the respondents are likely to engage in the contravening conduct again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">However, the public interest may warrant the making of an injunction notwithstanding that the contravener is not likely to engage in that contravening conduct again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Section 80(4) of the Code expressly provides that the Court's power to grant an injunction may be exercised in such circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I am satisfied that similar organisations, despite the fact that they are not being conducted primarily for the purpose of profit and the fact that the participants are volunteers, need to be aware of the need to comply with the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I am satisfied that the granting of the injunctions in addition to the declarations reinforces that message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Trade practices compliance program
 The parties seek orders pursuant to s 86C of the Code or, alternatively, pursuant to s 80 of the Code that the AKA implement a trade practices compliance and training program and send a letter notifying its members of the orders made by the Court in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The parties point out that the contraventions occurred because the respondents and the other AKA clubs which were party to the Understanding did not know that they were engaging in conduct in breach of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The orders are sought, it is said, to educate the AKA's members, officers and employees about their obligations under the Code and about the outcome of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">As such, the proposed program will raise awareness of the type of conduct that may contravene the Code and is therefore consistent with the purpose of a probation order under s 86C of the Code as defined in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">On one hand, it seems to me somewhat onerous for a voluntary organisation of the nature of the AKA with three part-time employees and the respondent clubs to require them to implement a compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Certainly it would be totally inappropriate to require them to implement the kind of program that would be appropriate for a large organisation or a large commercial enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">However, I see the force in the argument that it is necessary for clubs or organisations such as these not to contravene the Code in ignorance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">While in the present case little damage was done, that may not always be the case when understandings are made and implemented in contravention of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Accordingly it is, in my opinion, appropriate to make the orders sought in respect of the trade practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Pecuniary Penalty
 The imposition of a financial penalty is a matter for the Court, whether or not the parties propose an agreed figure ( Mobil Oil ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">I am aware that the AKA can pay the proposed penalty of $10,000 without going out of business or seriously impeding its activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">I am also aware of the strictures as enunciated in the cases of not substituting an amount by way of penalties simply because another sum comes to mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">I am mindful of the fact that the AKA has agreed to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount to be agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I am conscious of the fact that this is a voluntary organisation conducting kart racing in the interests of an interested section of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">I have taken into account the various factors elucidated in Mobil Oil regarding the public interest in the settlement of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Further, I take into account the following: I am satisfied that the agreed amount of $10,000 is within the permissible range in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">ORDERS 
 I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the orders as proposed by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">I will make the orders in Annexure A to these reasons, which, apart from one proposed declaration as to which there was no supporting evidence in the statement of agreed facts, accord with the orders proposed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">I certify that the preceding one hundred (100) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>

Dear Sir/Madam
 
 
Anti-competitive arrangement by the AKA
 
 
Following civil proceedings instituted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC"), the Federal Court of Australia has found that the Australian Karting Association (NSW) Incorporated ("the AKA") and three AKA members made an anti-competitive arrangement at the annual general meeting of the AKA which was held on 19 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The Court has declared that the AKA engaged in anti-competitive conduct (contravening the Competition Code of New South Wales ("the Competition Code")) by making an arrangement:
 to fix the minimum price for the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs (which is said to substantially lessen competition); and to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to non-AKA members by imposing a condition that the non-AKA members pay at least the minimum price (which is an exclusionary provision); 
and later giving effect to the above arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Competition Code has the same provisions as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), but applies to individuals and non-trading associations such as AKA clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">One of the Court's orders is that the AKA must write to each member to notify them of the outcome of these proceedings and to inform them of the illegality of making and giving effect to arrangements which substantially lessen competition or contain an exclusionary provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The AKA has been ordered to pay a penalty of $10,000 and to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The Court has also granted injunctions restraining the AKA from making arrangements of this kind in the future and has ordered that the AKA establish a trade practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">If as an AKA member you:
 agree with other AKA members to a minimum or set price for the hire of kart circuits; agree with other AKA members to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to a particular class of persons on particular conditions; or give effect to an agreement set out above, 
you may be in breach of the Competition Code and may be liable to pay fines of up to $10,000,000 for a company or $500,000 for an individual, as well as damages for any loss that is caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">You can obtain further information about the ACCC's proceedings against the AKA and the Trade Practices Act 1974 / Competition Code from the ACCC website at www.accc.gov.au .</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Yours sincerely
 
 
President
