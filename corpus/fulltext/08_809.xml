<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant ("Unilever") seeks an interlocutory injunction against the respondent ("Cussons") on the basis that Cussons has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by placing statements on one of its products, known as "Radiant micro Max".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The product is a liquid cleaning product used as a cleaning agent when washing clothes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The substance of Unilever's comparative advertising claim is that the script on the Radiant micro Max bottle which states that it is "Proven to Outperform Omo Small &amp; Mighty" ("the Radiant Statement") is misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">"Omo Small &amp; Mighty", which is produced by Unilever, is a product which performs a similar role to Radiant micro Max.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Unilever also claims that Cussons engaged in misleading conduct as to the relative prices and values of the two products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In response, Cussons filed a cross-claim alleging that Unilever has engaged in misleading conduct in respect of certain statements and images used on its Omo Small &amp; Mighty bottle and other products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">UNILEVER'S CLAIM 
 
2 The type-face of the Radiant Statement is large, colourful and eye-catching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is prominently situated towards the top of the bottle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Following the Radiant Statement is an asterisk which directs attention to a qualification in very small print at the bottom of the label on the front of the bottle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The qualification reads: "* On most of the common and tough stain types.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Based on recommended dosage".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">This qualification is very difficult to read and unlikely to be looked at with any great care or attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Indeed, the type-face of the qualification is so small as to be ineffective as a communication, especially when viewed in comparison with the broad and emphatic type-face of the Radiant Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 Unilever submits that the Radiant Statement connotes, by its use of the word "Proven", that the truth of the allegation has been established on proper and reliable scientific evidence and testing, and it further contends that a key question at trial will be whether the tests carried out by Cussons are sufficient to establish the truth of the Radiant Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 Unilever says that the claim made in the Radiant Statement is misleading because the tests conducted and relied upon by Cussons were deficient in a number of critical respects and do not in fact establish the accuracy of the Radiant Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In order to resolve this dispute, it will be necessary to consider detailed scientific evidence as to whether the tests can be said to support the representation made by Cussons in the Radiant Statement, having regard to a range of variables such as type of stains, water hardness, temperature of water and amount of liquid wash used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Unilever also relies on the presence of the qualification on the bottle to support the inference that Cussons recognises the need to limit the meaning of the Radiant Statement, but it says that the qualification is inadequate to serve this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 A number of observations are made by Unilever in relation to the presentation of Radiant micro Max and Omo Small &amp; Mighty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">First, it is said that Omo Small &amp; Mighty is sold in a 475mL pack whereas Radiant micro Max is sold in a 500mL pack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The recommended retail price of Omo Small &amp; Mighty is $5.99, whereas Radiant micro Max is sold for $4.99, which makes it the significantly cheaper product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Unilever observes that the recommended dosage for Omo Small &amp; Mighty is one cap (which equals 33mL), whereas the recommended dosage for Radiant micro Max is one and a half caps (which equals 60mL) for a normal load of washing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">For every wash, it is therefore said, significantly more Radiant micro Max is required than Omo Small &amp; Mighty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In addition, a bottle of Omo Small &amp; Mighty provides over 14 washes, while Radiant micro Max provides just less than nine at the recommended dosage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Accordingly, the Radiant micro Max is said to be 30% more expensive than Omo Small &amp; Mighty on a "per wash" basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is on the basis of these comparisons that Unilever says Cussons had engaged in misleading conduct when representing that its product was "Proven to Outperform Omo Small &amp; Mighty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">6 Unilever contends that Cussons' representations are misleading because the above matters and comparisons are not effectively brought to the notice of the consumer, and there is no practical or realistic means by which those matters can be ascertained by the consumer at the point of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is said that the consumer is misled as a result of Cussons creating an impression that Radiant micro Max is of superior quality and available at a substantially lower price, when in fact the consumer will have to pay more on a "per wash" basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">For these reasons, Unilever says there is a strong prima facie case that Cussons is engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct, and the grant of an interlocutory injunction is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">7 In response, Cussons contends that the qualification was appropriately prominent because it appears on the front of the label and is connected by an asterisk to the Radiant Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">However, without admissions, Cussons has offered to adopt as from 15 May 2008 a new form of front label for Radiant micro Max, which will enlarge and elevate the qualification to form part of the Radiant Statement at the top of the bottle's label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This, Cussons says, precludes any future assertion that the qualification is not sufficiently drawn to the customer's attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Accordingly, Cussons submits, as a consequence of the use of the new label, the positioning of the stock on the shelves of retailers, the speed of movement of the stock, and the fact that the largest retailer in Australia (Woolworths Limited) is not stocking the version of the bottle with the Radiant Statement means that interlocutory relief should not be granted insofar as it is based on the size or prominence of the qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">8 For present purposes, I am satisfied that the relocated qualification will, to some extent, lessen the previous impression created when the Radiant Statement was accompanied by an asterisk and fine print which was difficult to read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, that finding does not dispose of the issues between the parties because there may still be a final claim for damages on an account of profits and there are other aspects of the label which are said to be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">9 The dispute remaining in relation to Unilever's application turns on (i) the correctness of the Radiant Statement in relation to the assertion that Radiant micro Max has been proven to outperform Omo Small &amp; Mighty on most of the common and tough stain types at recommended dosages; and (ii) the comparisons in price to which I referred at [5] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 Considerable evidence has been filed in relation to both these and a range of other issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That evidence draws heavily on different scientific tests conducted on Radiant micro Max and Omo Small &amp; Mighty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">On the basis of this evidence, Cussons says that any prima facie case which Unilever may be able to raise is very weak and is insufficient to support its claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is said by Cussons that this weakness of Unilever's case as well as the balance of convenience should be taken into account and interlocutory relief should be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Cussons suggests that the most appropriate way of dealing with the matter is to obtain the earliest possible hearing on a final basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">11 I will not repeat here the detailed evidence of the parties concerning the performance characteristics of the two products over a range of different stains and textiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It suffices to say that it is not practicable at the present time to form any confident prediction as to the likely outcome or strength of the case brought by Unilever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">To properly consider the detailed evidence filed (and any further evidence which may become available), it will be necessary to have the benefit of interlocutory processes, cross-examination and addresses by counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">At this time, however, I am persuaded that the application brought by Unilever is sufficient to raise a prima facie case, as that term is defined by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">CUSSONS' CROSS-CLAIM 
 
12 Cussons has brought a cross-claim against Unilever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The cross-claim relates to two of Unilever's laundry liquid wash products, namely, Omo Small &amp; Mighty and "Surf Small &amp; Mighty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Both of these products are marketed in bottles which display the words "3X Concentrate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Both bottles display these words under the name of the product and use a silhouette to demonstrate that each product is equivalent to older products marketed by Unilever which were 1.4L in size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In addition, in the case of Surf Small &amp; Mighty, alongside the words "3X Concentrate", the words "As many washes as Surf 1.4L" appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">13 Cussons contends that these words which appear on Omo Small &amp; Mighty and Surf Small &amp; Mighty represent that the liquids in those products are three times as concentrated as the liquids in Unilever's older laundry liquid wash products (which, being 1.4L, were also approximately three times the size).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">These words, it is said, have the effect of representing that, at recommended doses, the performance qualities of Omo Small &amp; Mighty and Surf Small &amp; Mighty are the same as the older and larger products, whereas tests conducted on the liquids demonstrate that their characteristics do not support this representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Accordingly, Cussons claims that the representations are misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 On the present material and submissions, it seems to me that, as a matter of construction, the representations would be taken by a consumer not so much as indicating that the precise performance qualities of the liquids are identical or that the chemical composition or characteristics of the liquids are identical to the liquids in the larger containers, but rather go to the result that the same number of washes can be obtained from the smaller Omo Small &amp; Mighty and Surf Small &amp; Mighty as can be obtained from the liquids in the larger containers if the recommended dosages are used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">For instance, Surf Small &amp; Mighty describes its equivalence with the older and larger products not by reference to the inherent composition or concentration of the liquid, but by reference to the number of washes which a bottle will provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In the case of Omo Small &amp; Mighty, however, the way in which it is said to be equivalent to the older and larger products is less clear, and I think it unlikely that a consumer will closely study the back of the bottle to calculate the number of caps that are contained in the bottle, and the number of washes that it will produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The emphasis for which Unilever contends relates to the end result of the use of the products, namely, the number of washes produced rather than on the character or concentration of the liquid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">This, Unilever says, is what the consumer would really be interested to know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">While Unilever's position on this point is arguable, in my view Cussons has raised a prima facie case within the meaning of Australian Broadcasting Corporation 227 CLR at 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Whether Cussons' argument can be said to be strong or weak is not a matter which can be decided on the material filed to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 
 
15 The parties also addressed submissions to the balance of convenience in granting or refusing interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In my view, provided that an early date for final hearing is fixed, and even though the parties have established their respective prima facie cases, there is nothing in the balance of convenience which requires that the interlocutory relief sought by either party should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 Omo Small &amp; Mighty was launched in Australia in early February 2008 and national advertising commenced on 24 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It now has 9% of all Australian liquid wash sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Unilever says that Cussons, having conducted its tests quite some time ago in February 2008, has delayed the bringing of its cross-claim for the tactical purposes of ensuring that its product, Radiant micro Max, had entered the market before any litigation commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Unilever says that Cussons' deliberate delay points to disentitling conduct which should be taken into account in assessing the balance of convenience of awarding interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Unilever submits that the grant of interlocutory relief against it will disrupt its marketing of an innovative product, will cause substantial loss as a result of any recall, and will damage their brand in intangible ways which cannot be satisfied by a pecuniary award on a final hearing (such as by damaging relations with suppliers and losing shelf space in retailers' stores).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Accordingly, Unilever resists the grant of the interlocutory orders sought by Cussons on its cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">17 Cussons' position in respect of the balance of convenience is that the Court should not grant the interlocutory relief sought against it by Unilever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The reasons advanced to support this proposition are similar to those advanced by Unilever, except framed from the perspective of Cussons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In particular, Cussons says that interlocutory relief against Cussons would causes significant loss and damage to it, would undermine the extensive campaign of marketing and promotion it has conducted, and would be to some extent unnecessary, given that Radiant micro Max will be sold in Woolworths' stores only under its old (and unobjectionable) label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Cussons also says that the damage it would suffer would be unquantifiable, and it offers to cooperate to ensure that the matter progresses to an early final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">18 I consider that the appropriate course in the present case is to not grant any interlocutory relief in respect of either the claim or the cross-claim and to set the matter down for hearing on a final basis as soon as possible so that the evidence can be thoroughly appraised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">While I accept that both Unilever and Cussons could suffer some damage of an intangible and unquantifiable nature if subjected to an adverse order for interlocutory relief, I do not think that the balance of convenience falls sufficiently in favour of one party or the other to warrant the grant of such relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Having regard to the detailed evidence which has been already filed, it is evident that the matter can be determined at an early stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In such circumstances, interlocutory relief of the kind sought will likely be of little utility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">CONCLUSION 
 
19 In summary, although I find that the parties have established their respective prima facie cases, I find that the balance of convenience in this case leads me to refuse to grant the interlocutory relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Accordingly, I dismiss the application and the cross-claim for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Costs will be costs in the cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I direct the parties to send to my Associate in chambers Short Minutes of Order to enable the matter to be heard and determined at the earliest possible date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.</sentence>
