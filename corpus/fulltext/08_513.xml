1 This is a notice of motion which is brought by Mr Mark Simonsen to set aside orders of the Court that were made by consent on 10 March 2008 allowing an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and ordering that the bankruptcy of Mr Legge be annulled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 It is necessary to set out some of the circumstances to explain the background of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 Mr Legge was made bankrupt on 22 March 2004 on a petition which was brought by Mackinlays, a firm of solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The petition was founded upon a default judgment of the Perth Local Court which Mackinlays obtained against Mr Legge in respect of unpaid legal fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 Mr Legge applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to annul the bankruptcy and on 2 March 2007 the Federal Magistrate dismissed Mr Legge's application to annul his bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Parties to that application were Mackinlays, Mr Legge, and it also appears from the appeal book that the Official Trustee appeared before the Federal Magistrates Court with leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 Mr Legge then appealed against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In the meanwhile, and before the appeal was heard, Mr Legge succeeded in obtaining an order from the Western Australian Magistrates Court setting aside the default judgment which had been obtained by Mackinlays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 I heard the appeal on 10 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The parties that appeared at that appeal were Mr Legge and Mackinlays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Official Trustee appeared by leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appeal concluded by the Court approving consent orders which allowed the appeal and ordered the annulment of Mr Legge's bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I gave reasons for approving the consent orders ( Legge v Mackinlays Solicitors [2008] FCA 345).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The day after the consent orders were made and before they were extracted, Mr Simonsen wrote to the Court by email saying that he was not happy with the orders, that he was a creditor of Mr Legge and that he had not been given notice of the annulment application made by Mr Legge in the Federal Magistrates Court in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 I directed that the District Registry not extract the orders and I listed the matter for mention on 20 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The District Registrar asked the Official Trustee to notify all of the creditors of the mention hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Official Trustee did that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Official Trustee also sent a copy of my reasons to each of the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The only person who appeared at the hearing on 20 March 2008, other than the parties to the appeal and the Official Trustee, was Mr Simonsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">At the hearing I advised Mr Simonsen that if he wished to make any application, he should file and serve a notice of motion and an affidavit in support of that application, by 4 pm on 27 March 2008, failing which the orders made on 10 March 2008 would be extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 On 27 March 2008, Mr Simonsen filed a notice of motion and an affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, Mr Simonsen did not serve the notice of motion and the affidavit before the expiry of the time limit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This was because he was not given a listing date by the Registry until 28 March 2008 and also because he posted the notice of motion and affidavit to each of the two parties and the Official Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I am prepared to extend the time for the service of the notice of motion and the affidavit until 4 pm on 3 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 In his affidavit filed in support of the motion, Mr Simonsen said that he was a former business partner of Mr Legge and that the business partnership had terminated and the accounts were not yet settled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, he claims that Mr Legge owes him money arising from the partnership including a partnership debt which he settled with somebody else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Official Trustee has admitted a proof of debt in respect of Mr Simonsen, only to the extent of $100, but Mr Simonsen has deposed that he is in dispute in the Federal Magistrates Court with the Official Trustee in respect of claims arising from the partnership with Mr Legge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 Mr Simonsen went on to depose that he had not been served with the notification by Mr Legge of the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding to annul his bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, in para 11 and para 12 of his affidavit of 27 March 2008, Mr Simonsen deposed in the following terms:
 Based on discussions with Ms Heljo Cameron of ITSA, I became aware of the appellants [sic] ("Legge") application to annul his bankruptcy, but at that time I was not aware of the requirement that the appellant ("Legge") was required to serve me and other creditors with certain papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I did not become aware of this requirement until after the appeal was underway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It was sometime later when I was speaking with Ms Heljo Cameron of ITSA, that she made me aware of the subsequent appeal and that it was at this time I was informed by her that the appellant ("Legge") was aware of the requirements to serve creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I told her that I had not been served with anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 The first question is the standing of Mr Simonsen to make this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 Mr Simonsen was not a party to the annulment proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court and he is not a party to the appeal before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, the Court has power to make a person a party to an appeal even if the person was not a party to the proceeding below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The power is to be found in O 52 r 14(2) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The question is whether I should exercise the power to permit Mr Simonsen to become a party to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I will not exercise the power to do so, for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 The complaint that Mr Simonsen makes is that he was not served with notice of the annulment application before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 Mr Legge has given evidence that Mr Simonsen was given the notice but I will proceed on the assumption, without so finding, that Mr Simonsen was not served with the notice of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The evidence shows that Mr Simonsen learned from the conversation that he had with Ms Cameron from the office of the Official Trustee, that Mr Legge had made an application for the annulment of his bankruptcy to the Federal Magistrates Court and had been unsuccessful in that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The evidence is also that Ms Cameron, told Mr Simonsen that he should have been served with notice of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Further and significantly, Mr Simonsen also knew from those discussions with Ms Cameron that Mr Legge had appealed against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and that the appeal was on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">15 However, notwithstanding those facts, Mr Simonsen made no effort to become a party to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Instead, Mr Simonsen awaited the outcome of the hearing of the appeal and then for the first time, raised with the Court, albeit informally, his complaint about not having been notified of Mr Legge's annulment application to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 In my view, it is now too late for Mr Simonsen to apply to become a party to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It was open to him to take that action before the hearing of the appeal but he did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It would undermine the principle of finality in litigation if, after the outcome of the appeal, I were to permit a person to become a party to an appeal, in respect of a complaint of which he had knowledge prior to the hearing of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In these circumstances, I do not exercise the power to permit Mr Simonsen to become a party to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I, therefore, dismiss the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">17 I also note that Mr Simonsen attached to his affidavit a costs agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">However, it was not a costs agreement between Mackinlays and Mr Legge in respect of the charges made by Mackinlays which were the subject of the default judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This is apparent from para 11 of the affidavit of Mr Alistair Mackinlay which was sworn on 4 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I say this without prejudice to any arguments which Mackinlays may wish to make in the Western Australian Magistrates Court in respect of any proceedings they may take against Mr Legge, but on the evidence that is before this Court, that is the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis.</sentence>
