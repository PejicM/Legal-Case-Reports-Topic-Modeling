 WILCOX J: 
 
 1 In this proceeding, two associated companies sue another company, and its two directors, alleging, first, infringement of the first applicant's trade marks and copyright and, second, contraventions of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TP Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The copyright claim has dominated the debate between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The parties 
 
2 The applicants are Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited ('Aristocrat'), a designer and manufacturer of electronic gaming machines ('EGMs'), and Aristocrat International Pty Limited ('Aristocrat International'), a distributor of Aristocrat's EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Both companies are fully owned subsidiaries of Aristocrat Leisure Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They were represented at the hearing by Mr R Cobden SC and Mr N R Murray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The first respondent was named in the proceeding as Vidtech Gaming Services Pty Limited ('Vidtech').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At the time of the institution of the proceeding, this was its name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">At that time, the second and third respondents, David Allan Parry and Rhonda Denise Parry ('the personal respondents'), who are husband and wife, were its two directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">However, on 28 May 2005, Vidtech changed its name to DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 15 June 2005, it went into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 On 2 August 2005, I gave leave for the proceeding to continue against Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Nevertheless, Vidtech took no part in the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The personal respondents were represented by Mr J M Ireland QC and Mr D Accoto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 It is convenient for me to continue to call the first respondent 'Vidtech'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">However, the Court record should be corrected by substituting the first respondent's new name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I will make an order to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Background facts 
 
6 Many of the background facts are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It is agreed that Aristocrat is the owner of various registered trade marks that it applies to EGMs manufactured by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The registered trade marks include the following words, or collocations of words, relevant to this case: 'ARISTOCRAT', 'QUEEN OF THE NILE', 'DOLPHIN TREASURE', 'PENGUIN PAYS' and 'CHICKEN'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I will refer to these marks as 'the Aristocrat trade marks'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Aristocrat International is an authorised user of the Aristocrat trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">7 It is also agreed that Aristocrat is the owner of copyright in:
 
 
 (i) literary and artistic works incorporated into Aristocrat's EGMs ('Aristocrat artwork'); and
 (ii) literary works in the form of computer programs ('EPROMs') that operate Aristocrat's EGMs ('Aristocrat software').</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 

8 Until it went into liquidation last June, Vidtech carried on the business of purchasing and reconditioning used EGMs and re-selling them, apparently always outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Both the personal respondents actively participated in the conduct of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Two of Vidtech's major customers were Belgian Gaming Technology ('BGT'), a firm based in Ghent, Belgium, and Happy Games, based in Lima, Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 During the period 2001 to 2004, one or other of the personal respondents, from time to time, commissioned V R Farrow &amp; Co Pty Limited, trading as Capre Classic Graphics ('Capre'), to produce artwork that included substantial parts of the Aristocrat artwork for a particular model EGM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The artwork was displayed on perspex panels that were able to be installed in EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There is a dispute as to the use that was made of this artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">10 The evidence refers to two different types of EGMs: 'casino' EGMs and 'lowboy' EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Lowboy EGMs are sometimes called 'slant' EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Casino EGMs stand higher than lowboys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Casino EGMs have two artwork panels: a top panel and a belly panel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Lowboy EGMs have only a belly panel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 On the basis of documents made available to the applicants, the parties agreed that about 615 artwork panels were produced by Capre on behalf of Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Having regard to the comparative incidence of casino and lowboy EGMs, they further agreed that 615 panels would have provided the artwork for about 400 EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">12 The personal respondents concede that the manufacture of each perspex panel constituted an infringement of the first applicant's copyright in the relevant artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">However, they say the infringer was Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They do not concede that Vidtech, or either of them, was an infringer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 As Vidtech was not represented at the trial, there is no agreement or concession binding that respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">However, there is evidence of each of the matters of fact set out in paragraphs 6 to 12 and I make findings in the same terms as the agreements and concessions, against that respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Issues in the copyright claim 
 
14 There are five issues in the copyright claim:
 
 
 (i) whether any of the respondents authorised infringement of Aristocrat's artwork copyrights;
 (ii) whether the applicants have established infringement by any of the respondents of Aristocrat's software copyrights;
 (iii) if infringement is established, whether it is appropriate to grant injunctive relief;
 (iv) if infringement is established, the proper computation of compensatory damages; and
 (iv) whether this is an appropriate case for the award of additional damages, pursuant to s 115(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ('the Copyright Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 

15 There is also dispute as to whether the applicants have established that the respondents, or any of them, infringed the first applicant's trade marks and/or engaged in misleading conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The facts 
 (i) The 'Cleopatra' machines 
 
16 In August 2004, Constance Hsu, an employee of a Macau customer of Aristocrat, had a series of telephone conversations with Kenneth Phillip Jolly, Aristocrat's General Manager, Asia Pacific.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">During the course of these conversations, Ms Hsu referred to 'Cleopatra' EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Jolly told Ms Hsu that Cleopatra was not an Aristocrat game.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He subsequently visited the customer's premises in Macau and found, amongst other machines, two EGMs that incorporated artwork panels that were substantially similar to those used in Aristocrat's 'Queen of the Nile' EGMs, but which bore only the name 'Cleopatra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">A shipping list revealed that the machines had been supplied to Ms Hsu's employer by BGT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">17 Mr Jolly purchased one of the 'Cleopatra' machines and had it brought to Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The machine was displayed in court during the hearing of this case, along with a 'Queen of the Nile' machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Photographs of each machine, and of their individual panels, were tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There is no doubt (and it is not disputed) that the 'Cleopatra' artwork reproduces a substantial part of the 'Queen of the Nile' artwork and, therefore, infringes Aristocrat's copyright in that artwork: see s 14(1) of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">18 There are some differences between the 'Queen of the Nile' and 'Cleopatra' artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The major difference occurs in the casino EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The belly panel of the 'Queen of the Nile' machine displays that title with a head portrait of a woman wearing Egyptian ornaments against a background of pyramids, palm trees and a river passing through a desert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">This is a daytime scene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The top panel of the 'Queen of the Nile' machine (which includes the prize table) contains two smaller reproductions of the head portrait, one of which is accompanied by the word 'Cleopatra' and the other by the words 'Queen of the Nile'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">19 The 'Cleopatra' casino machine reverses this arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The top panel contains the large head portrait, also with a background desert scene, including pyramids, but with a night-time sky instead of sunlight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The belly panel is substantially similar to the top 'Queen of the Nile' panel, including prize table, but it displays the name 'Cleopatra' alongside each of the smaller head portraits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The words 'Queen of the Nile' do not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(ii) The Belgian raid 
 
20 In November 2004, the applicants instructed Belgian attorneys to institute a saisive descriptive (a pre-trial raid) against BGT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The raid took place on 12 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It resulted in discovery, at BGT's premises, of 37 'Cleopatra' artwork panels, one 'Penguin Pays' artwork panel, one 'Dolphin Treasure' artwork panel, one Aristocrat EGM incorporating 'Cleopatra' artwork panels and a quantity of business records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">'Penguin Pays' and 'Dolphin Treasure' are each EGM models manufactured by Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">21 The seized business records included an invoice from Vidtech to BGT dated 17 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The goods listed on that invoice included 64 Aristocrat machines, 20 items described as 'Casino Belly Panels Artwork' and 20 items called 'Casino Top Panels Artwork'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The artwork items were invoiced at US$50 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The invoice also included four 'Mk 4 Conversion Kits' at $50 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The abbreviation 'Mk 4' is a reference to Aristocrat's Mark IV 'Queen of the Nile' machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">A 'conversion kit' usually contains the artwork and EPROMs that are necessary to convert an EGM from one game to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">22 The seized documents also included a Vidtech packing slip dated 10 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Amongst the goods listed on the packing slip were three machines, each identified as 'Cleopatra' and by reference to an individual serial number that corresponded with the serial number of an Aristocrat 'Queen of the Nile' machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">These three machines were noted as 'LB', which, the parties agree, means 'lowboy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">23 The seized documents also included an email from Mr Parry to Johan Temmerman of BGT dated 13 January 2005 in which he said:
 
 'I am buying some machines today i will let you know how many Aristocrats are available over the weekend!</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Cleopatra theme is not a problem, as you know we have developed the artwork for Queen of the Nile/Cleopatra, so we could make as many as you want.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">' 
 

24 At about the end of January 2005, Mr Parry received a telephone call from Mr Temmerman telling him about the pre-trial raid, which had occurred about two weeks earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">As a result of that conversation, Mr Parry assumed that Vidtech would become implicated in a copyright infringement case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Mr Parry discussed the matter with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">He then sent an email to Tim O'Reilly, the principal of Happy Games in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">That email included the following:
 
 'Johan at Belgian Gaming has phoned me to inform me that Aristocrat raided his factory with a search warrant and confiscated one machine, downloaded all data from his computer hard drive and accused him of infringing Aristocrat copyrights with regards to artwork!!!</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This has implicated me as they are now in possession of my correspondence with him ...In future correspondence can you please ensure that you &lt;U&gt;NEVER&lt;/u&gt; refer to the particular model of machine in question ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I am expecting to be contacted by various organizations in the near future regarding these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Please bear this in mind when we next talk on the phone --- you know the old saying: loose lips sinks ships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">' 
 

25 During cross-examination, Mr Parry gave the following evidence about this email:
 
 'What provoked you to communicate with Mr O'Reilly in relation to what's going on at Belgian Gaming Technology?---It was basically because Mr O'Reilly and Mr Temmerman knew each other and I did not know at the time if Mr O'Reilly had purchased any equipment off Mr Temmerman and therefore he might be at risk as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 Mr O'Reilly purchased equipment directly from you did he not?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 Were you concerned that something that Mr O'Reilly might do might implicate you or Vidtech further?---In a roundabout way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 What would be that roundabout way?---I sent artwork to Belgian Gaming Technology and they passed it on to Mr O'Reilly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 By that point you accepted did you in your own mind that the artwork infringed copyright?---By then, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 By the end of January?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">' 
 

26 Mr Parry denied he had ever sent any copied artwork panels directly to Happy Games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He said all the copied panels had gone to BGT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Mr Parry said that he had sold machines with artwork and EPROMs to Happy Games, but he insisted that this artwork and these EPROMs were original Aristocrat products, not copies made by Capre or anyone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">He said in evidence that his fear was not that he had sold Happy Games anything that would cause a problem, but that BGT may have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">(iii) The 'trap purchase' visit 
 
27 The applicants instructed Trade Mark Investigation Services ('TMIS') to investigate Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">TMIS engaged two private investigators, Themis Papas and Julia Chai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The two investigators visited Vidtech's premises at Moorebank at about 1pm on 7 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Evidence about what happened during the course of that visit was given by Mr Papas and Mr Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Neither Ms Chai nor Mrs Parry gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">No explanation was offered for the absence of either woman from the witness box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">28 Mr Papas said that, earlier on 7 March 2005, he and Ms Chai attended Aristocrat's office at Alexandria for a briefing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">They then went to Moorebank and entered Vidtech's main office, located in unit 5 of an industrial complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">During the course of the ensuing half hour, they engaged in conversation, in that office, with Mr Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mrs Parry was present during this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">She was apparently occupied with a laptop computer and made no substantive contribution to the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Papas secretly video-taped the visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">However, he had the sound turned off, in order to avoid contravening legislation relating to listening devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">His visual footage was produced at the hearing but was not very informative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">29 It seems nobody made a contemporaneous record of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">However, immediately after the visit to Moorebank, Mr Papas made notes of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The personal respondents tendered them in evidence in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The notes are generally consistent with Mr Papas' affidavit and oral evidence, although there are items in the affidavit that do not appear in the notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">30 In his affidavit, Mr Papas described the place where most of the conversation took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He, Ms Chai and Mr Parry sat at a round meeting table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Mrs Parry worked at a desk nearby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Shelves near the meeting table were stacked with electronic switches and mother boards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">31 According to Mr Papas' affidavit, Ms Chai told Mr Parry that she and Mr Papas were interested in purchasing refurbished casino tops for export to China and Macau.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Parry described the nature of Vidtech's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">He asked what type of machine Ms Chai wanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">She replied 'Mark V Series 1'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This was a reference to an Aristocrat EGM model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Parry said this machine 'is really hard to get at the moment' and recommended Mark V Series 2, a later Aristocrat model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">After some discussion about the note validators on the machines, Mr Parry quoted prices for Mark V machines (US$2,250 for Series 2 and US$1,750 for Series 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Ms Chai asked: 'Do you also do the conversion software?</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">' Mr Parry replied:
 
 'We can supply any game you want.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">You tell me the games and I'll tell you if we can do it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The reason we are doing it this way is because we enter into copyright issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">' 
 

32 According to Mr Papas, Mr Parry then displayed some examples of 'Cleopatra' artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">He said:
 
 'We do our own artwork but don't keep this in house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The reason is that if a representative of Aristocrat were to see this he would be wondering why I copied it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">But we do it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Here is one I have been working with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Its Queen of the Nile but we don't actually call it Queen of the Nile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">We call it "Cleopatra".</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">There is no mention of Queen of the Nile on there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">' 
 

33 There was conversation about conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Party quoted a price of US$200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He said:
 
 'If you wanted to get a conversion kit from say Aristocrat, it would cost you about $3000 to $6000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This is practically cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">We do the top artwork, the bottom artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">So you get the top artwork, the bottom artwork, the button legends and the EPROM software for $200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

34 At this point, Mr Papas claimed, Mr Parry stood up and lifted one of a number of polystyrene sheets from a box on the floor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Papas said the sheets contained numerous EPROMs that had white stickers with the names of Aristocrat games on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Mr Papas quoted Mr Parry as saying:
 
 'We've got a full library, that's just some of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Like Margarita Magic, Enchanted Forest, Mystic Garden, Duke, Inca Sun, Golden Pyramid, Golden Ra, Golden Treasure, Penguin Pays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">We keep a hardware copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">' 
 

35 Mr Papas asked about loading the EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Mr Parry demonstrated the technique by placing a blank EPROM into an EPROM burner on a desk near the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">36 There was discussion about delivery of machines to Hong Kong and installation there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Mr Parry offered to do the installation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He said: 'I have been to Hong Kong, I have been to Macau, Singapore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">We do installations, as far as South America'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">37 According to Mr Papas, Mr Parry then took Ms Chai and Mr Papas to a store room on the ground floor of Unit 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It contained about 30 Aristocrat and Konami EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">(Konami is another EGM manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">) Some machines had been refurbished, some had not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Mr Parry pointed to one EGM which had 'Cleopatra' on the top panel and 'Queen of the Nile' on the belly panel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Mr Papas said the following conversation ensued:
 
 'David Parry said: "See where it says 'Queen of the Nile'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Ours says 'Cleopatra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">We do subtle changes for copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">" 
 
 I said: "It's the same game though.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">" 
 
 David Parry said: "Yes it's the same game.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Yeah, most of the software is on the EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">We have what is called game control software programmers that can do ten games at a time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">
 
 They've got rows and rows of them and they've got what is called gang programmers --- they can do twenty individually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Or stick all the chips in and do them all at once.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">' 
 

38 According to Mr Papas, Mr Parry then took him and Ms Chai to a storeroom in an adjacent unit (No 3), which contained about 30 lowboy machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Mr Parry said: 'We sell these converted slant machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">' Ms Chai remarked 'today we might just buy some software'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">She added 'I must speak with my client and then make some further orders'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Mr Parry responded:
 
 'We can upgrade them to just about the latest game that comes out of the door, but then again you can't advertise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">But if you buy the equipment first, we can supplement them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">We are able to give you a package, we've got the facility to do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">' 
 

39 Mr Papas said Mr Parry then took him and Ms Chai to the office in this unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Mr Parry uncovered a polystyrene sheet on the table that had the word 'Masters' in red letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">It contained over 100 EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">These EPROMs bore Aristocrat game titles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Mr Parry said: 'We have every single game.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">These are the masters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Ms Chai asked him which games were popular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He answered, naming (amongst others) 'Queen of the Nile', 'Dolphin Treasure', 'Penguin Pays' and 'Chicken'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">40 According to Mr Parry, the following conversation ensued:
 
 'Julia Chai said: "When can you deliver?</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">"
 
 David Parry said: "Two to three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">"
 
 Julia Chai said: "Why so long?</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">"
 
 
 David Parry said: "The EPROMs are copied here but the screen printing is done elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I do not keep it on site as I have to be careful as there are copyright issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Also it depends if I need to get artwork done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">If not, and you take the four I have developed, then it will be faster I just need to call the printer who has it on the computer and tell him to press go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">"
 
 Julia Chai: "Which four have you developed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">"
 
 David Parry said: "Queen of the Nile, Penguin Pays, Chicken and Enchanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">"'
 

41 At this stage, Ms Chai left the room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">On her return, she told Mr Parry that she wished to buy 'six copies of each of Queen of the Nile, Penguin Pays, Chicken, Enchanted'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The party returned to the main office in unit 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Mr Parry said a deposit of 20% was required, Ms Chai asked for a faxed quotation and Mr Papas said he would come back the next day and pay the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Mr Papas and Ms Chai then left the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">42 That afternoon, Mr Parry faxed to Mr Papas a quotation in the following terms:
 
 'We are pleased to submit the following quotation: 
 
 To Supply 70 x Refurbished Aristocrat MVP Video Slot Machines @ USD 2,250 ea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 To Supply 5 x Refurbished Aristocrat MVP Slant Top Machines @ USD 1,500 ea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 To Supply 24 sets x Conversions for --- Queen of the Nile 
 Penguin Pays 
 Chicken 
 Dolphin Treasure 
 At a cost of USD 200 per conversion 
 
 Total Quotation: USD 169,800 
 
 This Quotation does not include any modifications required with regard to the Bill Validators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">This Quotation does not include any freight/shipping charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 A 20% deposit will be required on placement of order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Full payment to [be] paid prior to shipping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 If installation is required all expenses including accommodation and air travel for two technicians to be covered by the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 

43 Mr Papas said that, later that afternoon, he received a telephone call from Mr Parry during the course of which Mr Parry stated he had 'ordered the four types of conversion kits'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">44 Mr Papas had agreed to pay a deposit on the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">However, he did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">There was a telephone conversation between him and Mr Parry on that day in which Mr Parry claimed the deal was for both machines and conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">There was discussion about that, in which Mr Papas said 'We'll still buy the conversion kits first and then we'll get the machines'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">45 There were later conversations and attempts by Mr Papas to contact Mr Parry in order to pay a deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">These attempts were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">46 Mr Parry made an affidavit in which he referred to Mr Papas' affidavit and said:
 
 'I do not agree that the affidavit fully or accurately sets out the events and conversations which occurred on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">However, I do agree that during the course of my discussions with them I showed them certain equipment including a machine which I had purchased from GPT Software which is used for programming and reprogramming bill validators in relation to all poker machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 
 During this visit I also showed the private investigators and following Mr Papas' request demonstrated the operation of an integrated circuit burner by transferring data from one EPROM chip to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">I also showed the investigators some artwork for one or more brochures stored on my laptop computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">At no stage did I show them the software for any Aristocrat EPROMS stored on my laptop computer and no such software was then stored on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The only form in which I had the software for EPROMS was in the collection of EPROMS which had been obtained from original Aristocrat machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">' 


In his affidavit, Mr Parry did not challenge the detail of Mr Papas' account of the visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">47 Under cross-examination by Mr Ireland, Mr Papas said Ms Chai had the primary role, he was merely assisting her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Ms Chai 'handled most of the discussion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">He agreed that his affidavit did not set out all the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">He said 'there would be heaps ... that's not in the affidavit that was said in an hour ... there was way too much to remember'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In the course of questioning, Mr Papas mentioned some of the other matters, including that it was Ms Chai (not Mr Parry) who first mentioned conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Mr Papas also agreed that Mr Parry had cautioned against the purchase of machines that had been used in Queensland, apparently because of the way they had had to be programmed for use in that State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">48 Mr Ireland asked Mr Papas whether the artwork was the first thing shown to him by Mr Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">He said it was and quoted Mr Parry's statement about 'Cleopatra' being 'still Queen of the Nile', 'we change the name slightly to Cleopatra because of copyright issues'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Mr Papas confirmed Ms Chai 'chopping and changing' between talking about machines and conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">He also confirmed that Mr Parry had both quoted prices for machines and US$200 for conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Mr Ireland also took Mr Papas once again through his description of Mr Parry's action in burning an EPROM and his observations about the number of EPROMs in the polystyrene sheets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">49 Mr Ireland asked Mr Papas how he would have handled the interview with Mr Parry, if he had been in charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The exchange between Mr Ireland and Mr Papas was not without interest; but what is important about the cross-examination is that at no time did Mr Ireland challenge the essential elements in Mr Papas' account of the conversation and the events that occurred during, or after, his visit to Moorebank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">50 Mr Cobden asked Mr Parry few questions about the visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Mr Parry said he had felt at the time that the story of Mr Papas and Ms Chai 'just didn't ring true'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">He explained:
 
 '... we're in the business of selling second-hand refurbished machines and they were just concentrating all the time on conversions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">We had done our business with them and they kept enforcing they wanted conversions, conversions, conversions and I just thought, well, that's not the way it normally works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">They normally buy machines off me, that's what I do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">' 
 

51 Earlier in his evidence, Mr Parry had said that, at the time he had artwork prepared by Capre, he was unaware this would infringe Aristocrat's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">But he had admitted to Mr Cobden that, at least by January 2005, he was aware of the infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">52 Against that background, I had this exchange with Mr Parry:
 
 'Just on that last topic, if you smelt a rat why did you offer the conversion kits in your fax quotation?---Basically, your Honour, I was saying the only thing they wanted at the time to get the machine order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 
 But you would've known, wouldn't you, the conversion kit involved breach of copyright?---Yes, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">
 
 By this time you really knew it would be breach of copyright?---By now I knew it was breach of copyright so I decided not to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">
 
 No, but you sent the quote?---I sent the quote but I did not deliver the artwork, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">
 
 That's because it was never accepted?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">' 
 

53 Mr Parry claimed that, on his instructions, a Vidtech employee, Andrew Logan, had refused to accept from Mr Papas a deposit on the conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">(iv) The Anton Piller visit 
 
54 A few weeks after the Moorebank visit, on 31 March 2005, the applicants obtained an Anton Piller order allowing search for, and seizure of, documents held by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The seized documents established that the manufacturer for Vidtech of the perspex artwork was Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The principal of Capre, Mr V R Farrow, subsequently made an affidavit that was read at the trial in the applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">He attended for cross-examination by Mr Ireland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">55 The Anton Piller search disclosed several polystyrene trays and motherboards containing EPROMs, 757 in all, six perspex panels and various documents including invoices, packing slips and emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">(v) The liquidator's documents 
 
56 After Vidtech went into liquidation, the liquidator took possession of various company documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The solicitors for the applicants gained access to those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">They provided information about the affairs of the company, but nothing about the extent of its copyright infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Infringement of Aristocrat's artwork copyright 
 
57 As I have indicated, it is conceded by the personal respondents that, over the years, Capre produced 615 perspex panels for Vidtech, these panels all being reproductions of a substantial part of the Aristocrat artwork for a particular machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">There is no suggestion that either Mr or Mrs Parry personally copied any Aristocrat artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The case against them is that they authorised the copying effected by Capre; which copying constituted an infringement of Aristocrat's copyright in the artwork: see s 36(1) of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">This case is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Both Mr Farrow and Mr Parry gave evidence that all the panels were produced, from time to time, pursuant to instructions given to Capre by Mr or Mrs Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Mrs Parry made no admission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">However, as she elected not to give evidence, the evidence of Mr Farrow and Mr Parry about her participation stands unchallenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">58 As Mr and Mrs Parry were at all times acting on behalf of Vidtech, that respondent must also be taken to have authorised the infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">59 Section 36(1) of the Copyright Act makes it an infringement of copyright for a person, who is not the owner or licensee of a copyright, to authorise the doing in Australia of any act comprised in the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">See also s 13(2) of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">So all three respondents have infringed Aristocrat's artwork copyrights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">60 A question arises as to whether Mr and Mrs Parry, or either of them, knew from the outset that the artwork produced by Capre infringed Aristocrat's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Mr Parry conceded he knew this at least by January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">61 Mr Farrow gave evidence about the first discussion between himself and Mr Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">He said Mr Parry's first request, relevant to this case, was made in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That request concerned reproduction of 'Queen of the Nile' panels, changing the name to 'Cleopatra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">During the course of his cross-examination, Mr Farrow had a discussion with Mr Ireland about the extent of the changes Capre made to the 'Queen of the Nile' artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">He emphasised the similarities between the original and reproduced artwork and said he 'presumed, after deleting the word "copyright" off the panel, that [we] were infringing copyright'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The evidence went on:
 
 'You thought you were?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">
 
 And you were prepared to do that?---I had an order and I was commissioned and Dave is a licensed dealer and he was selling the machines and not myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">So I did the art, he signed them off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">
 
 So you were prepared to abdicate responsibility to what you thought was his judgment about what he was doing?---No, I was doing what I was asked to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">
 
 Without regard to the consequences legally in respect of your activities?---No, because I didn't feel I had any issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">I was asked to do a job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">I did a job, signed off and I got paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">' 
 

62 Mr Farrow said he realised that all the perspex panels given to him, for the purpose of reproduction of artwork, had been taken from second-hand EGMs, including some Aristocrat EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In his affidavit, Mr Farrow said he never asked Mr and Mrs Parry what they did, or intended to do, with the perspex panels produced by Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He said:
 
 'I knew that Mr Parry was engaged in the business of converting second-hand EGMs and assumed that these Perspex panels were somehow associated with Mr Parry's conversion business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">I am also aware that the respondents submitted taxation exemption documents to Capre which contain a declaration by either Mr Parry or Mrs Parry that they intended to export the printed Perspex panels supplied to them by Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Sales that were intended for export were exempt from sales tax (and later, GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">' 
 

63 Mr Farrow said he was not reluctant to reproduce the artwork: 'Mr Parry's the one who is signing off the artwork, he's the one selling the machines, I'm just preparing the artwork as instructed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">64 Mr Parry was asked about his knowledge of the copyright situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He conceded that, in 2001, he understood 'that to copy existing artwork would infringe copyright'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">He also understood this would apply to the painting of 'a faithful copy' of the artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Later, Mr Parry gave this evidence:
 
 'But as far as the artwork is concerned, for example, in the Queen of the Nile game with the beautiful picture of Cleopatra and the pyramids and the jewellery and the rest of that, as far as you knew that was the same?---I'm not sure about the pay table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The pay schedule might have been different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">
 
 But the balance of the artistic elements as you understood it were the same?---It would have been the same theme?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">
 
 And so what you understood that BGT wanted was something that was not like the European one in the sense of pay tables but was a faithful copy of the Australian one?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">
 
 And you understood, did you not, that to make a faithful copy of the Australian one as at 2001 would infringe copyright?---You would have to duplicate the symbols which is the symbols on the pay table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">
 
 Yes, and that was what BGT expected you to get a quote for, wasn't it, something that duplicated the Australian artwork?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">
 
 And you knew at that time [that] that infringed copyright?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">I discussed it with Viv but --- yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">
 
 And you knew, did you not, that when you ordered the first round of whichever game it was that the making of those perspex panels would infringe copyright?---I discussed with Viv, Mr Viv Farrow and he seemed to believe at that time - - - 
 
 Just let me interrupt you there?---Mm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">
 
 My question was you knew - not what discussions you had with Mr Farrow - you knew at that time that to make those copies of Aristocrat's artwork would infringe copyright?---I didn't know that at the time because he hadn't produced it yet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It was only after he had produced it and we seen the layout as you see there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">' 
 

65 During the course of his evidence, Mr Parry more than once mentioned his concern to ensure the accuracy of the pay tables reproduced by Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The pay tables had to correspond with the software program embedded in the relevant EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">At an early stage of his cross-examination, Mr Parry gave this evidence:
 
 'Because it was important to you that what Capri had reproduced was faithfully reproduced in the prize tables and artwork from the Aristocrat games?---Well, if they made a mistake with the pay table then Capri would have to re-run the artwork and I would have to pay for it again if I got it wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">
 
 But you wanted the artwork to be as faithful a reproduction as possible, did you not, of the original Aristocrat artwork?---Mostly to do with the pay schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The pay schedule had to match.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">
 
 You were concerned on your account with the question of copyright when you went to see Mr Farrow?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">
 
 You say now that you were concerned mainly with the pay tables, correct?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">' 
 

66 In discussion with Mr Cobden about the head portrait on the 'Queen of the Nile'/'Cleopatra' artwork, Mr Parry said: 'At the time I believed that it was sufficiently different but not now'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He went on to refer to his discussion with Mr Farrow and said 'from his professional aspect of it I believed that it was sufficient'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">67 Immediately before Mr Parry left the witness box for an overnight adjournment, I sought to clarify what seemed to be inconsistencies in his evidence regarding knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">The following exchange occurred:
 
 'Just to clarify that, what you said earlier was that you didn't know it until after you saw the artwork?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">But if he'd have made a replica copy exactly, I would have known that infringed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">
 
 But what Mr Cobden is saying is that you previously said you did know that it infringed copyright and then you've said, when he asked you about that further you said, well, only after I saw the artwork and then I gathered from that that you were saying that when you saw the artwork, you realised it would infringe copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Is that what you're saying?---I'm not quite --- I don't understand your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">
 
 Well, I'm trying to find out --- I don't want to put words in your mouth but are you telling Mr Cobden that at some stage you did realise that the artwork would infringe the copyright?---Yes, I understand it now to - - - 
 
 No, did you understand it in about 2001?---No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Once Mr Farrow had shown me that as a proof, he hadn't produced the artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">It came out in a drawing type of thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">I thought it was sufficient to get past and discussions with him led me to believe that it would not contravene artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Later I do believe it contravenes artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">
 
 So would it be fair to summarise your position as saying that you had a concern about infringement of copyright at the beginning?---Yes, in the beginning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">
 
 You saw the artwork, perhaps encouraged by some assurances that Mr Farrow gave you you thought there is enough change to make it non infringing, is that what you are saying?---Yes, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">' 
 

68 As previously mentioned, Mr Parry acknowledged that, at least by January 2005, he accepted that the perspex panels manufactured for him by Capre infringed Aristocrat's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">However, despite some assertions by him to the contrary, it seems Mr Parry knew this from the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">He was always aware it was essential exactly to reproduce the Aristocrat pay table for the relevant machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">He said:
 
 'Well, the pay table had to represent the game software otherwise it just --- there would have been a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">If you played the machine and then said that --- say for instance three Queens should have [given] you 14 coins and the artwork said 12, so I had to reproduce; the pay table had to be reproduced accurately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">' 
 

69 A faithful reproduction of a pay table is itself enough to constitute an infringement of copyright: see Millwell Pty Ltd v Olympic Amusements Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 63 ; (1999) 85 FCR 436.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">70 There is no direct evidence that Mrs Parry knew Capre's reproduction of the panels infringed Aristocrat's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">However, especially having regard to the absence of evidence to the contrary, I think I should draw the inference that she either knew or suspected this to be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Mr and Mrs Parry worked together in the business; apparently both of them full-time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">They shared a small office and the work that needed to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">I have found that Mr Parry was aware there was a copyright problem in relation to the reproduction of the artwork contained on manufacturers' EGMs and that reproduction of the pay tables was itself enough to constitute infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">It is improbable that Mr Parry failed to discuss these important matters with his wife and tell her his conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">71 I find that both the personal respondents knowingly infringed Aristocrat's artwork copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">As they were acting on behalf of Vidtech, it follows that Vidtech also knowingly infringed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Infringement of Aristocrat's software copyrights 
 
72 The position in relation to this issue is less clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Mr Parry consistently asserted he had copied Aristocrat EPROMs only rarely, when it was necessary for him to replace a damaged or defective EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Mr Parry agreed that it would be necessary for a customer, which wished to convert a machine from one game to another, to change the EPROMs in the machine; otherwise the software would not coincide with the pay tables displayed on the new artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">However, he said it was not necessary for him to send copies of EPROMs to customers wishing to convert; EPROMs for all the games were readily obtainable from machines the customers already had; they could build up their own library of master EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">73 There is no doubt that Vidtech held an extensive EPROM library, both at the time of the 'trap purchase' visit and the date of execution of the Anton Piller order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The size and careful organisation of the EPROM library naturally create suspicion of extensive EPROM copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">74 Mr Parry vigorously denied extensive copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The flavour of his evidence can be obtained from this segment of his cross-examination:
 
 'What I want to suggest to you, Mr Parry, is that rather than disposing of the artwork panels to BGT in the way in which you've described, instead Vidtech put them into finished machines along with EPROMs and dispatched them to overseas customers?---No, that's incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">


 
 I suggest to you that answer is untruthful?---No, that's incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">


 
 I suggest to you that when engaging in that activity with respect to the 600 or so panels obtained from Mr Farrow that Vidtech under your direction also burnt EPROMs to match the artwork panels and put them into games?---No, that's incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">The only ones we burnt was for the repair of the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">


 
 You gave evidence that the labels occasionally lifted off, that exposed the small window and an ultraviolet light then degraded the software?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">


 
 In those circumstances, is this correct, you would burn a replacement EPROM?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">


 
 If that had happened in two EPROMs in a game would you burn two replacement EPROMs?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">
 
 Would you do three?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">
 
 And if it was a four EPROM game and there were four you would do four?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">
 
 In those circumstances you would then apply to the freshly burnt EPROMs a hand-written label?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">
 
 I suggest to you that Vidtech under your direction had a practice of burning EPROMs not merely for that purpose but also for the fitting out of games with artwork commissioned from Capri?---No, there was - the fact that we sold so many machines to Belgian Gaming they would have had all the machines themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">There was no way in the world [they] would purchase EPROMs off me when they had them in their own warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">
 
 Is it your case that you did not send customers like BGT EPROMs?---I could have done, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">There might have been an odd occasion when they particularly didn't - or they'd lost the set themselves or whatever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">
 
 So it was your practice was it if they lost a set of EPROMs that you would send them a set over?---If I could help him, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">
 
 Was that a set of EPROMs that you burnt a copy of to send to them?---No, that was out of my existing stocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">' 
 

I have to determine whether to accept this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">75 Mr Parry's statement about BGT not often needing him to provide EPROM copies has some credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">I accept that a large customer like BGT might have built up its own EPROM library, by burning copies of genuine Aristocrat EPROMs taken out of second-hand machines that it had purchased from Vidtech or someone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">It might often be enough for a customer like BGT to purchase artwork panels, and perhaps other hardware, in order to convert one game to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">This conclusion is supported by the circumstance that the Cleopatra machine discovered in Macau, which was purchased from BGT, had EPROMs with yellow labels, whereas Vidtech seems always to have used white labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">76 However, there is evidence that Vidtech sold machines or conversion kits containing copied EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">It comes, first, from two email exchanges in early 2005 and, second, from Mr Papas' account of the conversation during the visit of 7 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">77 The first email exchange was on 13 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">On that day, Mr Temmerman of BGT emailed to Vidtech a request for its inventory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">He added: 'Do you have any Mk5/MVP with Cleopatra theme?</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">If yes, how many available?</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">' Mr Parry responded:
 
 'I am buying some machines today i will let you know how many Aristocrats are available over the weekend!</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Cleopatra theme is not a problem, as you know we have developed the artwork for Queen of the Nile / Cleopatra, so we could make as many as you want.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Will send you an invoice for the Stop the Clock artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">' 
 

As counsel pointed out, the offer was to supply machines, not loose perspex panels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">They said the supply of machines with 'Cleopatra theme' would necessarily involve 'the creation not only of artwork but the installation of "as many" EPROMs as BGT wanted'
 
78 The other exchange occurred a few weeks later, on 7 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">A man named Miro Janjus sent to Vidtech an email in these terms:
 
 'I am interested in purchasing 10till20pcs Aristocrat slots (9-21 winning lines, types like Pinguin, Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile etc.) for my firm in Bosnia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">
 
 ... 
 
 Send any offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">' 
 

79 Mr Parry responded:
 
 'We have all of the machines you mention below, i will send you a list of the types of machines in stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">What Aristocrats do you want ?</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">MK5 series 1, or MVP,s?</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">
 
 I will be away for a couple of day;s [sic], will answer your queries when i get back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">' 
 

Once again, the subject concerned the purchase of machines, including 'Cleopatra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">80 I have already recounted the evidence of Mr Papas concerning the conversation that he and Ms Chai had with Mr Parry on 7 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">It will be recalled that Ms Chai asked Mr Parry whether Vidtech did 'the conversion software'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">He responded: 'We can supply any game you want'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Mr Parry quoted a price of $200 for conversion kits, stating 'you get the top artwork, the bottom artwork, the button legends and the EPROM software for $200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">' It was in that context that Mr Parry showed Ms Chai and Mr Papas his EPROM library.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Later he spoke about 'software programmers that can do ten games at a time'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Such a rate of production would be unnecessary if copying was done only to replace the odd damaged or defective EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">81 Mr Parry also spoke about upgrading machines 'to just about the latest game that comes out the door'; something that could only be done with a package that included the relevant EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">In response to Ms Chai's inquiry about time for delivery of games, Mr Parry said: 'The EPROMs are copied here but the screen printing is done elsewhere'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">82 All of these statements are inconsistent with Mr Parry's assertion that Vidtech only copied EPROMs in order to replace the odd damaged or defective original EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Importantly, Mr Ireland did not challenge Mr Papas' evidence, and Mr Parry did not deny, that the statements were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Moreover, the alleged statements are consistent with the contents of the quotation faxed to Mr Papas on the afternoon of the visit, which included 24 conversion sets for four specified Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Mr Parry acknowledged in cross-examination that 'mere artwork wouldn't convert a machine', EPROMs would also be needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">It is true, as counsel for the respondents submitted, that Mr Parry's offer to sell conversion kits to Mr Papas does not itself prove he had sold conversion kits in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">However, it would be surprising if the first occasion on which he made this offer was to people whom he thought 'did not ring true'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">83 In their final written submissions, counsel for the applicants claimed there was an incongruity between Mr Parry's evidence that he sometimes copied whole sets of EPROMs --- see para 74 above --- and his claim that he only copied EPROMs where this was necessary in order to replace damaged or defective EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Counsel said:
 
 'In the witness box Mr Parry revealed that he regularly burned copies of Aristocrat EPROMs; he said this was when the EPROMs became faulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">He burned whatever was needed for that purpose, even whole sets ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">He also burnt and supplied EPROM sets to overseas customers; he said in the witness box that this was only for the same purpose but that should not be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">
 
 But how a whole set of EPROMs would have suffered: 
 
 (a) label failure, so that the label lifted off revealing the small porthole, and 
 
 (b) ultra-violet damage to the whole set together, and on all the EPROMs, 
 
 was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Why it was that among the sets of EPROMs found at Vidtech on execution of the orders, including the "Master" library, each set is almost invariably similarly labelled --- so that if there is one handwritten label, the whole set is hand-labelled --- was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">
 
 This does not speak of replacing an old label or labels lost through heat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">It speaks of an enterprise of copying EPROMs in complete sets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Mr Parry's denial to the contrary should not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">' (transcript references omitted, original emphasis)
 

84 Counsel went on to submit, correctly I think, that, even if EPROMs were burnt only for replacement purposes, that itself would infringe Aristocrat's copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">85 Counsel for the applicants submitted the Court should draw the inference that the respondents routinely infringed Aristocrat's software copyright, by copying the software to blank EPROMs for use in refurbished EGMs'
 
86 After careful consideration of the relevant evidence, including Mr Parry's denials, I have decided I should accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Although the evidence is sparse, there is enough to satisfy me that Vidtech copied Aristocrat's EPROMs whenever it needed to do so in order to make up a conversion kit to change one game to another or to provide appropriate software to a machine being converted from one game to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">87 It is plain that Mr Parry was involved in the copying of EPROMs on behalf of Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">There is no evidence that Mrs Parry copied EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">However, the personal respondents worked in an office that contained numerous EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It is inconceivable that Mrs Parry did not know what was going on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Unlike the situation in relation to artwork, the copying of EPROMs was not a matter of degree; the whole of the material on an EPROM had to be copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">It follows that, if Mrs Parry burnt an EPROM, or saw someone else do so, she must have realised this was an infringement of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">88 Counsel for the respondents submitted that 'not one document has been obtained which sustains the fundamental submission made to the Court by Aristocrat that the whole of the business of Vidtech involved the creation of counterfeit gaming machines employing perspex panels used in conjunction with replicated EPROMs for that purpose'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">89 I agree that the evidence does not establish that the whole of Vidtech's business 'involved the creation of counterfeit gaming machines'; I do not believe this activity did constitute the whole of Vidtech's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">However, such a claim is not a fundamental of the applicants' case; indeed they did not make that claim at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">90 Another comment made by counsel for the respondent, in their final written submissions, was that 'each computer program embodied in an EPROM has a unique algorithm which allows a test to see whether two programs are the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">No evidence was offered that any of the EPROMs found on the Vidtech premises during the search conducted on 1 April 2005 was other than an authentic EPROM'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">91 The problem about this comment is the lack of relevant evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">I am prepared to assume the correctness of counsel's statement that 'each computer program ... has a unique algorithm'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary effect, I would have thought that, when a new EPROM is burned, it reproduces exactly the same program, with the same algorithm, as the original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">92 The applicants led no evidence that the seized EPROMs were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Accordingly, if there were evidence that it would have been possible for the applicants' experts to detect whether those EPROMs were counterfeit or original Aristocrat products, counsel's submission would be highly persuasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">However, there is no such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">For all I know, it was impossible for the applicants' experts to tell whether the EPROMs seized on the Anton Piller search were genuine or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Consequently, I can give no weight to this comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">93 Having regard to the finding set out in para 86, it is not strictly necessary for me to resolve an issue between the parties about the packing slip of 10 June 2003 seized in Belgium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">This document listed machines that were being placed in a container intended for shipment to BGT on 'MV Commander'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The list stated the name, serial number, date of manufacture and style of each machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">It named one machine as 'Queen of the Nile' and three machines as 'Cleopatra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">All four machines had Aristocrat serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">94 Mr Cobden questioned Mr Parry about this packing slip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The following exchange occurred:
 
 'The fourth entry there is described as a machine called Cleopatra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">Now, Aristocrat has never manufactured a machine called Cleopatra?---That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">
 
 And yet you have shipped, Vidtech here has shipped a machine called Cleopatra to Belgium Gaming Technology?---That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">
 
 And that's because, is it not, you had made up a machine with Cleopatra panels of the kind made by Mr Farrow and with EPROMs in it sourced from somewhere containing the Queen of the Nile game?---No, that's incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">
 
 Well, can you explain how it that the - - -?---Well, as I explained yesterday, three of [us] used to trolley the machine into the container and it was the onus on the person putting the machine in the container to record the serial number and the name and the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Now, these machines were low boys and they all had plastic bags on them and I presume that one of the boys put his hand over the top of the glass and the first he's seen was Cleopatra and he wrote down Cleopatra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">
 
 One of the boys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">By "one of the boys" do you mean Mr Logan or your son?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">' 
 
 Both of whom had worked for --- as at 2003 how long had they worked in the industry?---About 18 months [for] Andrew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">
 
 And you accept, don't you, that Queens of the Nile is one of the most famous and successful poker games sold in Australia?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">
 
 And you're suggesting, speculating, that somebody has written down "Cleopatra" on a list, on a handwritten list?---Yes, and I think I queried it because I circled it where it's got low boy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">I actually think I circled it but because were producing Cleopatra Queen of the Nile, Queen of the Nile Cleopatra, I just accepted it as a mix up and I let it go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">' 
 

95 This evidence may be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">In contrast to the machine identified as 'Queen of the Nile', all three machines listed as 'Cleopatra' were lowboy machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">They had only one perspex panel, the panel containing the pay scales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Although the authentic version of that panel contains the words 'Queen of the Nile' in the bottom left hand corner, the top of the panel is dominated by the word 'Cleopatra' alongside the Egyptian head portrait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">It is not unlikely that a relatively junior employee would have looked at this word and written it down as the name of the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Furthermore, someone has drawn a circle around the letters 'LB', inserted in relation to each of these machines, but not in relation to any other machines on the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">This suggests that someone noted an error, or made a query, in relation to these machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Mr Parry was not able to say who circled the letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">It seems it must have been somebody at either Vidtech or BGT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Apparently the packing slip was in that form when it was seized in Belgium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">96 The evidence does not permit me to say how many Aristocrat EPROMs were copied by Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The parties' agreement about the approximate number of machines upon which infringing artwork was installed (400) suggests this is likely to be the upper limit of the number of machines and conversion kits for which EPROMs were copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">However, the figure of 400 is unlikely to be precisely correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">There were probably occasions upon which it was not necessary for Vidtech to supply copied EPROMs, as Mr Parry explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Against that, there would have been occasions upon which EPROMs were copied in order to replace damaged or defective EPROMs in otherwise non-infringing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Moreover, there is some evidence of the large-scale supply of EPROMs by Vidtech, separately from the supply of either EGMs or conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">I think I would do no injustice to the respondents if I proceeded on the basis that Vidtech copied the EPROMs necessary to service 400 EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Injunctive relief 
 
97 Infringement of copyright having been established, there would ordinarily be little dispute about the appropriateness of the Court granting an injunction restraining future infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">98 However, the personal respondents contended that, in this case, an injunction is unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Their reason is that, shortly before commencement of the trial, they filed an undertaking in the following terms:
 
 'Without admission the second and third respondents and each of them undertake to the Court that neither of them will reproduce or authorise any other person to reproduce copies of any perspex panels containing artwork for the applicant's poker machine games known as; 
 
 &#8226; Queen of the Nile 
 &#8226; Dolphin Treasure 
 &#8226; Penguin Pays 
 &#8226; Chicken 
 
 or any other poker machine games manufactured and sold by either of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">' 
 

99 Counsel for the applicants argued that, notwithstanding this undertaking, the Court should grant an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">A few days after Vidtech went into liquidation, a new company, Vidtech Gaming Technology Pty Limited, commenced conducting the same type of business as that previously conducted by Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The sole director of the new company is James Parry, a son of Mr and Mrs Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Both Mr and Mrs Parry work for the new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Counsel argued that the replacement of the old Vidtech company by the new 'demonstrates why injunctive relief against Mr and Mrs Parry is appropriate'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">100 Notwithstanding this consideration, I see no need for an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Any injunction would need to be couched in language very similar to the language of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">There is no need for an injunction addressed to the old Vidtech company; it has ceased to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The new Vidtech company is not a party to this proceeding, so no injunction may be granted against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">An injunction could only restrain acts performed by the personal respondents; the undertaking covers the same ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Moreover, the undertaking extends beyond the four games named in this proceeding to include 'any other poker machine games manufactured and sold by either of the applicants'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">101 The undertaking set out in the filed document is offered to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">It has the same practical effect as an injunction; in either event, non-compliance is punishable as a contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">I accept the undertaking and, on that basis, refuse the applicants' request for an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Computation of compensatory damages 
 
102 There is an enormous difference between the parties as to the appropriate level of compensatory damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The applicants led evidence from a chartered accountant, Stuart Robertson, calculating total losses at $6,350,145.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">By contrast, counsel for the respondents submitted that the applicants' maximum damages were $30,750.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">103 Mr Robertson's computation depended almost entirely on data supplied to him by others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">So it is not a criticism of Mr Robertson for me to say there are numerous problems with his final figure, considered as an appropriate measure of the applicants' damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">104 First, Mr Robertson broke up the final figure into losses by Aristocrat of $1,260,104, losses by Aristocrat International of $980,649 and the remainder ($4,109,389) as being losses sustained by 'Aristocrat International's subsidiaries'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">However, none of the subsidiaries is an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Consequently, any such losses would not be recoverable in this proceeding, even if I were satisfied that the relevant subsidiary had sustained the loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">105 Second, Mr Robertson calculated the losses by applying Aristocrat sales prices and cost data to estimates of the volume of Vidtech's sales of Aristocrat product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The sales prices and cost data were supplied to him by Graham John Ward, Aristocrat's Group Financial Controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Mr Ward made an affidavit to which he exhibited a sheet showing the average revenues and costs per unit (Mark IV and Mark V machines only) in each of the financial years 1999 to 2005 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">As I understand the position, Mr Ward used the word 'unit' to describe a 'game kit': those elements in an EGM or conversion kit that are subject to copyright i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">the perspex panels, computer software burnt into EPROMs and button inserts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">His sheet disclosed substantial, and unexplained, differences in the revenues and costs averages for each year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">106 Apparently, the information on this sheet was what was supplied to Mr Robertson, so his calculation was not of the difference between the gross proceeds of sale of EGMs and conversion kits and the gross costs of producing those products, but the difference between the estimated proceeds of sale of 'units' and the costs of producing those 'units'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">107 Mr Robertson made an estimate of Vidtech's volume of sales of Aristocrat product (EGMs and conversion kits) between April 1999 and March 2005 and assumed, as he was instructed to do, that each Vidtech sale was of product that included infringing material (artwork or EPROMs) and was made at the expense of a sale by the Aristocrat company that serviced the relevant geographical area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">108 At para 122 of his report, Mr Robertson explained the task he had undertaken:
 
 'I have been instructed as to the average revenues received by Aristocrat, Aristocrat International and the latter's subsidiaries for sales of conversion kits and initial game kit components of EGMs in each financial year, and the average marginal costs incurred by each company per conversion kit and initial game kit component of EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">I have been instructed to calculate the value of lost sales (resulting from Vidtech's infringing conduct) on the basis of these revenues and marginal costs per unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">I am instructed that Aristocrat EGMs have a higher selling price and margin than Aristocrat conversion kits and initial game kit component of EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">I note that calculating lost sales on the basis of conversion kits margins is therefore a conservative approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It does not take into account the additional profit margin lost to Aristocrat, Aristocrat International and or the latter's subsidiaries as a result of sales of infringing EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">' 
 

109 The bulk of the loss calculated by Mr Robertson stemmed from assumed lost EGM sales, as distinct from conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">However, only conversion kits were separately sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">In order to relate lost EGM sales to the claim, it was necessary to assess what proportion of their value was attributable to the 'game kit' they contained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">110 I think both the assumptions adopted by Mr Robertson are unsupportable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">111 Mr Ward gave evidence that Aristocrat sold both new machines and refurbished used machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">However, the data supplied by him to Mr Robertson excluded used machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">So the assumption is that each sale by Vidtech was at the expense of an Aristocrat sale of a new machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Vidtech was a refurbisher and vendor of used machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">As is evident from the quotation faxed by Mr Parry to Mr Papas, it was prepared to offer machines at prices around $US2,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Apparently, the sale price of a new Aristocrat machine in March 2005 was about $AUD12,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Having regard to that substantial difference, it cannot be assumed that each Vidtech sale cost Aristocrat a sale of a new machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">112 Furthermore, the data supplied to Mr Robertson claimed a total of 2,375 lost sales over the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Yet, as I have indicated, the highest available estimate of the number of infringing machines or conversion kits sold by Vidtech is 400.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">It is that figure, rather than 2,375, which must be used for the purposes of any computation of compensatory damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">There is no evidentiary basis for the assumption that all 2,375 machines contained infringing material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">113 In their written submissions, counsel for the applicants correctly observed that the financial records produced by Vidtech are poor and incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">I agree there are significant unexplained cash transactions, that money has been directed to places (like the Isle of Man) where tracing is difficult and that money has been muddled up between corporate and personal accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Counsel submitted that, in these circumstances, it was appropriate for their clients to approach the problem of computation in the manner adopted by Mr Robertson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">However, they effectively conceded that the figure of $6.3 million cannot be supported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">They said:
 
 '... the applicants do not contend that the Court should find that all sales of Aristocrat machines by the respondents were infringing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Plainly some authentic reconditioned second hand machine[s] were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The total figure identified in Mr Robertson's report provides a "ready reckoner" for the purposes of assessing compensatory damages and interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">' 
 

114 Counsel went on:
 
 'For the purpose of considering how to approach compensatory damages, the applicants submit the following factors are relevant: 
 
 
 
 (a) Mr Parry has admitted commissioning the infringing artwork and copying Aristocrat EPROMs; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) even if Ms Chai or Mr Papas did mention the possibility of conversion kits first (which is irrelevant), the evidence supports a finding that the respondents had sold conversion kits prior to that meeting and there is no suggestion that Mr Parry showed any resistance to the proposition that he might provide conversion kits, even after he was on notice of Aristocrat investigating BGT for copyright infringement; 
 
 (c) Mr Parry's denial of shipping EGMs with counterfeit material should not be believed for the reasons outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">' 
 
 

115 Point (a) is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">In relation to EPROMs, the admission extends only to copying EPROMs to replace damages or defective EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">However, as I have indicated, I am prepared to estimate total sales of infringing products (EGMs or conversion kits) at 400.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">I accept the thrust of points (b) and (c) of counsel's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">116 It appears that Aristocrat sells conversion kits that enable customers to convert one Aristocrat game to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The kit contains the necessary artwork and EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Mr Ward said the conversion kit price differs between markets and from customer to customer; in Australia the price range would be $3,000 - $4,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">This seems a high figure, being well above the cost of purchasing a refurbished used machine from a company like Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">However, counsel for the applicants pointed out that, in some places, gaming operators are limited to a particular number of machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">They said the operator might prefer to convert a relatively new, untarnished machine, rather than to acquire a second-hand machine which, even refurbished, might not be so attractive to gamblers as a newer, converted machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">117 No doubt some operators would think this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">That might explain conversion kit sales in the price range mentioned by Mr Ward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">However, there is no evidence of the volume of such sales, in Australia or overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Nor is there any evidence of the price that Aristocrat charges overseas customers for conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Given that Vidtech seems to have sold mainly, if not exclusively, to overseas customers, overseas prices are more relevant to this case than the Australian price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">118 Having regard to these considerations, I think it would be unfair to the respondents, and incorrect, to use the Australian conversion kit price ($3,000 - $4,000) as a basis for calculation of compensatory damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">But I lack the evidence necessary for me to calculate the value of Aristocrat's lost overseas sales (if any) of conversion kits and used EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">So I do not think it is possible for me to compute damages by reference to Aristocrat's loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">The only feasible course is to adopt an accounting for profit approach; to estimate the amount of Vidtech's net gain from its infringing conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">119 Counsel for the respondents based their submission about damages upon the premise that the only infringement of copyright established against the respondents is in relation to the 615 perspex panels manufactured by Capre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Counsel argued the 'only proper basis to approach damages in this case is to assume a loss to Aristocrat constituted by the profit it would have made in the sale to Vidtech in Australia of perspex panels, assuming that had occurred'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Counsel referred to documents produced by the applicants showing sales of perspex artwork panels to Aristocrat customers at prices ranging from nil to $225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">The figures average $114.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Counsel then referred to invoices showing Capre had charged Aristocrat an average of $40 for each perspex panel made by Capre on Aristocrat's instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Counsel said that, allowing something for whatever other costs would have been incurred by Aristocrat, it was reasonable to take a figure of $50 as representing the average net profit which would have been earned by Aristocrat if the 615 panels in question had been supplied by it to Vidtech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">Multiplying 615 panels by $50 yields a figure of $30,750 which, counsel argued, 'is the limit of the claim on the matters established by Aristocrat in its case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">120 These figures might be justified if the only infringement was that relating to artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">However, that is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">EPROMs were also copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">In the absence of a better guide, I have assumed that the number of copied EPROM sets was roughly the same as the number of sets of artwork; that is, EPROMs for about 400 EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">On that basis, the infringing items constituted the bulk of the items that would be included in a conversion kit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">121 Mr Parry quoted $US200 per conversion kit in the fax he sent Mr Papas on 7 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">At that time, $US200 would have amounted to about $AUD275.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The cost of production of the conversion kits (including the non-copyright items) would probably not have exceeded about $75, leaving a minimum profit of about $200, on a sale at this price, ascribable predominantly to the inclusion of infringing material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">122 The evidence contains an email from Mr Parry to Mr O'Reilly of Happy Games, dated 18 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">This email reports the dispatch of five parcels 'to the first five people on that list you sent me'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Mr Parry went on:
 
 'You will owe me for 3 x Aristocrat programmes @ USD 400 ea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">' 
 

He totalled this item at $US1,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">Mr Parry also claimed $US7,320 for EPROMs, apparently 750 in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">This email seems to indicate that $US200 was not necessarily the maximum price obtainable for conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">It also suggests EPROM copying on a massive sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">123 It is possible --- indeed likely, given the items seized in the pre-trial raid on BGT - that some artwork panels were sold separately from EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">That being so, the agreement about artwork for 400 machines does not necessarily mean that 400 EGMs or conversion kits containing infringing EPROMs were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">On the other hand, as the email to Mr O'Reilly suggests, some conversion kits may have been sold at prices above $US200 and copied EPROMs may have been sold separately from copied artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">124 It will be seen there are factors supporting both a higher and lower figure than $200 in relation to the profit derived by Vidtech from each unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The evidence does not permit a precise calculation of the appropriate figure for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">As counsel for the applicants submitted, I can only make a broad assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">I think my decision would fairly reflect the evidence if I maintained the figure of $200, as an overall average figure, per infringing 'game kit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">400 x $200 equals $80,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">I propose to assess compensatory damages, in relation to each respondent, at that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">125 It is necessary to add to that assessment an allowance for interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">The infringing conduct took place over a four year period, from sometime in 2001, to about April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">I will take the mid-point of that period (2003) and allow interest for three years at 8% per annum; that is $19,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">It follows that the total amount of compensatory damages, in relation to each respondent, will be $99,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Additional damages 
 
126 Section 115(4) of the Copyright Act relevantly provides:
 
 'Where, in an action under this section: 
 
 (a) an infringement of copyright is established; and 
 (b) the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so, having regard to: 
 
 
 
 (i) the flagrancy of the infringement; and 
 (ia) the need to deter similar infringements of copyright; and 
 (ib) the conduct of the defendant after the act constituting the infringement or, if relevant, after the defendant was informed that the defendant had allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright; and 
 ... 
 (iii) any benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant by reason of the infringement; and 
 (iv) all other relevant matters; 
 
 
 
 the court may, in assessing damages for the infringement, award such additional damages as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">' 
 

127 Counsel for the applicants argued this is a proper case for the award of additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">They said:
 
 'The respondents' infringing conduct has been flagrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">Whilst copying of artwork and EPROMs was admitted by Mr Parry in cross-examination, this followed a history of the respondents covering their tracks prior to, and during the preparatory stages of, this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">Liability has never been admitted on the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Mr Parry has admitted knowledge of copyright issues and innocent infringement was never pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">' 
 

128 Counsel for the applicants made particular mention of subpara (ib) of s 115(4)(b) of the Copyright Act , concerning the conduct of a defendant after being informed of an allegation of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">It was in this period, counsel said, that Mr Parry gave his 'loose lips sink ships' warning to Mr O'Reilly; yet he continued to offer Cleopatra machines to BGT and Mr Janjen and made a written offer to sell conversion kits to Mr Papas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">His attitude was 'business as usual'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">129 In relation to subpara (iii) of s 115(4)(b) , benefit to the respondent, counsel said:
 
 'Regardless of the extent of the respondents' infringement, the provision of infringing material was used to assist the respondents to promote their sales of (infringing or non-infringing) second-hand EGMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">This was confirmed by Mr Parry in his justification of the offer to provide conversion kits to Mr Papas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The EGMs were sold for amounts starting at, but often in excess of, $US1,200.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The respondents have given no evidence of their costs structure or of their profitability, and again, in the absence of such evidence the Court will not draw inferences in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">' 
 

130 The respondents did not put submissions in relation to the possible application of s 115(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">131 There is force in the submissions made by the applicants in relation to s 115(4) ; however, I think, only in relation to Vidtech and Mr Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Although I have found that Mrs Parry authorised artwork copying, and was aware, or at least had reason to suspect, that this copying involved infringement of copyright, I do not think the evidence establishes flagrancy on her part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">I do not propose to award additional damages against Mrs Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">132 Section 115(4) of the Copyright Act offers little guidance as to computation of additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">It merely authorises an award of 'such additional damages as [the Court] considers appropriate in the circumstances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Having given the matter careful consideration, I am of the opinion that, in relation to Vidtech and Mr Parry, I should add an additional 50% to the calculated compensatory damages, before interest; that is to say $40,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">The trade marks claim 
 
133 Counsel for the applicants argued that the respondents infringed their client's trade marks in two ways by:
 
 
 '(a) reconditioning EGMs with counterfeit artwork that incorporated Aristocrat's registered trade marks for various games; and 
 
 (b) using the trade mark "ARISTOCRAT" in relation to the sale of EGMs in circumstances where, by reason of their reconditioning, the EGMs are not the same goods to which the applicants applied their mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">' 
 
 

134 Counsel for the respondents submitted as follows:
 
 'The perspex panels which were provided did not, according to Mr Farrow's evidence (and the artwork which is seen in the Macau machine) include reference to either the word "Aristocrat" or the word "Queen of the Nile".</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">
 
 Accordingly, the only trade mark infringement that can be argued by Aristocrat would be the application by Capre Classics of the registered marks "Dolphin Treasure", "Penguin Pays" and "Chicken" to perspex panels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The application of those registered trade marks was not carried out by Vidtech itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">It was done by Capre Graphics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">The Trade Marks Act does not have a comparable doctrine to the law of authorisation such as operates under copyright law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Vidtech did not sell the panels in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">It sold them to overseas purchasers and a sale to overseas purchasers is not a use of the trade mark in Australia, within the reach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">In short, no trade mark infringement has been demonstrated by Aristocrat in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">' 
 

135 I accept these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">The applicants' trade mark claim is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The misleading conduct claim 
 
136 In relation to this claim, counsel for the applicants argued:
 
 'Vidtech, with the knowing involvement of each of Mr and Mrs Parry, has represented in trade or commerce --- especially in trade or commerce with places outside Australia --- that the EGMs in which Vidtech was dealing, loaded with artwork and game EPROMs, were authentic Aristocrat EGMs in that form, when they were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">There is actual evidence of confusion: Ms Hsu in Macau had received an infringing Cleopatra machine but though [sic] it was an authentic Aristocrat machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">' 
 

137 The respondents deny that their conduct was misleading or deceptive, within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">They say there is no evidence of any misleading representation in trade or commerce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">138 The counterfeit artwork suggested the EGM to which it was attached, or would be attached by use of the conversion kit, was a genuine Aristocrat product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">That was not true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">However, the difficulty, from the applicants' point of view, is that there is no evidence that any suppliee of the counterfeit artwork was misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">BGT and Happy Games seem to have been well aware of what was going on; possibly other purchasers also were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">139 It is possible that persons who purchased from a Vidtech suppliee, such as the Macau company which employed Ms Hsu, were misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Poker machine players may also have been misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">However, so far as the evidence reveals, all these people were outside Australia; any representation made to them was made outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">Under these circumstances, there must be a doubt as to whether the respondents' misleading conduct falls within s 52 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">140 This issue was not addressed by counsel and I have not attempted to form a view about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">Even if the s 52 claim were to succeed, it would not affect the relief to which the applicants are entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Disposition 
 
141 I propose to enter judgment in favour of the applicants against each respondent: in the case of Vidtech and Mr Parry, in the sum of $139,200; in the case of Mrs Parry, in the sum of $99,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Any payment on account of damages by one respondent is to be regarded as a satisfaction, to that extent, of the judgment against the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">142 The applicants seek a general order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Counsel for the respondents requested that, given the matters in contention between the parties and the discrepancy between the scale of the applicants' claim 'and the damages which may ultimately be awarded', the Court should later hear submissions on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">143 I am prepared to accede to this request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">However, I do not wish the parties to be put to the expense of a further oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">I will direct that, within 21 days, each set of parties is to forward to my Associate a written submission about costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">I certify that the preceding one hundred and forty-three (143) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Wilcox.</sentence>
