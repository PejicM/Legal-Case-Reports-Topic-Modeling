1 This is an application for a consent determination of native title in respect of an area in the Pilbara region of Western Australia designated "Determination Area A", being part of the land and waters covered by the Eastern Guruma native title claimant application the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The parties to the Eastern Guruma application, which was commenced on 21 October 1997 and covers an area of approximately 8,700 square kilometres, have agreed upon the terms of an order determining that native title exists over Determination Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They ask the Court to make an order by consent on the terms which they have agreed and to do so without holding a further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 The parties in this proceeding represent a variety of interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicant brings the proceedings on behalf of the Eastern Guruma people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The State of Western Australia acts on behalf of the community generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Local government interests are represented by the Shire of Ashburton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Pastoral interests encompass Coolawanyah Station, Mt Florance Station and Rocklea Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Mining interests and those of the telecommunications industry are represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There are also other indigenous interests, represented by the Pilbara Native Title Service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The applicant has nominated the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation ('the Corporation') as the prescribed body corporate to hold the native title of the claimant group on trust following a determination in these proceedings pursuant to s 56(2) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">That nomination is in writing and the Corporation has given its consent to the nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I am satisfied that the requirements of the Act and of the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 (Cth) have been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 Settlement of native title claims by agreement is to be welcomed and encouraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It means that the parties can decide for themselves how best to institute an arrangement that satisfies their respective rights and interests in a way that, as appropriate, recognises the rights and interests of the other parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I congratulate the parties on demonstrating the wisdom and practical good sense in coming to this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 Section 87 of the Act specifically provides for the making of orders giving effect to an agreement reached between the parties where the agreement relates to a part of the proceedings, without holding a hearing or, if a hearing has started, without completing the hearing ' if it appears to [the Court] to be appropriate to do so '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There are, however, preconditions:
 
 &#8226; The period specified in the notice given under s 66 of the Act must have expired (s 87(1));
 &#8226; An agreement must be reached between the parties as to the terms of the order (s 87(1)(a));
 &#8226; The terms of that agreement, in writing signed by or on behalf of the parties, must have been filed with the Court (s 87(1)(b)); and
 &#8226; The Court must be satisfied that an order in, or consistent with, those terms would be within the power of the Court (s 87(1)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">

7 The first condition is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The period of 3 months after the notification day referred to in subss 66(8) and 66(10)(c) of the Act ended on 4 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Secondly, the parties have reached agreement on the terms of the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Their agreement is in writing and has been signed by or on behalf of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It was filed with the Court on 9 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Thirdly, the Court has jurisdiction to make the orders sought (s 81 of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is nothing in the terms of the orders that would suggest that the Court does not have the power to make them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In particular, the orders set out the matters mentioned in s 225 of the Act as required by s 94A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 The next question is whether it appears to be appropriate to make the orders consented to by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">As noted by Black CJ in Lota Warria ( on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62 at [7], the discretion conferred by s 87(1) must be exercised judicially and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That includes the resolution of native title disputes by mediation and agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 As in the Poruma and Masig Peoples case, the requisite continuous physical, spiritual and cultural connection of the Eastern Guruma people with Determination Area A is common ground and there is evidence to support that connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Orders may be made under s 87 where the Court is not provided with all of the evidence of the primary facts substantiating native title where the Court is satisfied that the parties have freely and on an informed basis come to an agreement ( Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [8] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 The applicant and the State of Western Australia have filed a joint submission in support of the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I am informed that the State has had regard to the requirements of the Act and the evidence and, ' through a rigorous and detailed assessment process ', has satisfied itself that the determination is justified in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 I have been provided with anthropological material in the form of reports by Dr McDonald and Ms Venz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Those reports were prepared by the applicant and considered by the State and other interested parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Some of the material responded to questions raised by the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The reports also considered the affidavits and preservation evidence taken by the Court in December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">That evidence included audiovisual material recording senior Eastern Guruma people speaking about their connection to various places within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">They told stories about those places and sang songs about them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Evidence was given by Nelson Hughes, Peter Stevens and Eva Connors, who were born on the land the subject of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">They spoke of the descendants of Wirntawari who identify and are identified as Muntulgura Guruma and of the descendants of Jack Smith to whom the Muntulgura Guruma accord rights and interests in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">12 The Eastern Guruma application includes land and waters also covered by another native title determination application, the Innawonga Bunjima application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There has been agreement in relation to the land and waters covered by that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">There are also areas of special interest to the applicant in the Kuruma Marthudunera native title determination application and the applicant in the Puuntu Kunti Kurrama Pinikura native title determination application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There has been agreement between the respective applicants that recognises that special interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There has been agreement with respect to the pastoral interests within Determination Area A and the area covered by the Karijini National Park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">13 There has not been agreement as to the balance of the land and waters the subject of the Eastern Guruma application, namely the area of the Tom Price townsite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The parties have agreed that no determination be made with respect to that area at present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">14 The terms of the orders are clear and unambiguous and have been freely agreed upon in circumstances where the parties have had access to competent and independent legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">15 The reports, to which all the parties have had regard, recognise that traditional laws and customs are not ' fixed and unchanging .</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Rather, they evolve over time in response to new or changing social and economic exigencies to which all societies adapt as their social and historical contexts change ' ( Clarke on behalf of the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagulk Peoples v Victoria [2005] FCA 1795 at [11] per Merkel J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">16 I am satisfied that the Court can and should make an order in the terms sought by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I make an order in accordance with the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">That includes an order that the Corporation is to hold the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the Eastern Guruma people pursuant to s 56(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">17 The parties acknowledge that the effect of the making of the determination is that the members of the native title claim group, in accordance with the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by them, should be recognised as the native title holders for Determination Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">As has been emphasised by the Court on other occasions, the order that the Court will now make determines, under the laws of Australia, that native title exists according to the traditional laws and customs of the Eastern Gurama people and that the title is held by those people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The order does not grant native title; it recognises what has long been held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

<sentence id="s65">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Subject to paragraphs 5 to 10: 
 
 
 (1) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests held by the native title holders are non-exclusive rights to: 
 

(a) enter and remain on the land, camp, erect temporary shelters, and travel over and visit any part of the land and waters;
 
(b) hunt, fish, gather or take and to use, share and exchange the resources of the land and waters such as food, water and medicinal plants and trees, timber, charcoal, ochre, stone and other traditional resources (excluding minerals);
 
(c) engage in ritual and ceremony on and in relation to the land and waters; and
 
(d) care for, maintain and protect from physical harm, particular objects, sites and areas of significance to the native title holders.</sentence>

 (2) The native title rights and interests set out in sub-paragraph (1) are exercisable in accordance with the traditional laws and customs of the native title holders for personal, domestic and non-commercial communal purposes (including social, medicinal, cultural, religious, spiritual and ceremonial purposes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">(3) The native title rights and interests set out in sub-paragraph (1) do not confer: 
 

(a) possession, occupation, use and enjoyment on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others; nor
 
(b) a right to control the access of others to the land and waters of Determination Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Notwithstanding anything in this determination the native title rights and interests include the right to take and use ochre to the extent that ochre is not a mineral pursuant to the Mining Act 1904 (WA), but do not include other minerals and petroleum as defined in the Mining Act 1904 (WA), Mining Act 1978 (WA), the Petroleum Act 1936 (WA) and the Petroleum Act 1967 (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">6.</sentence>

<sentence id="s76">The nature and extent of other rights and interests in relation to Determination Area A in existence at the date of this determination are those set out in the Second Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The relationship between the native title rights and interests described in sub-paragraph 4(1) and the other rights and interests referred to in paragraph 8 ("the other rights and interests") is that: 
 
 
 (1) to the extent that any of the other rights and interests is inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of the native title rights and interests, the native title rights and interests continue to exist in their entirety, but the native title rights and interests have no effect in relation to the other rights and interests to the extent of the inconsistency during the currency of the other rights and interests; and otherwise,
 (2) the existence and exercise of the native title rights and interests do not prevent the doing of any activity required or permitted to be done by or under the other rights and interests, and the other rights and interests, and the doing of any activity required or permitted to be done by or under the other rights and interests, prevail over the native title rights and interests and any exercise of the native title rights and interests, but do not extinguish them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Nothing in paragraph 9 is intended to affect the operation of Part F of the Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd --- Eastern Guruma Indigenous Land Use Agreement (Area Agreement) ("ILUA") dated 27 November 2002 and registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on 5 March 2004 (Tribunal No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">WI01/1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the native title rights and interests co-exist with the "Agreed Interests" in the "Agreement Area" (as those terms are defined in the ILUA), the native title rights and interests can only be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the ILUA.</sentence>
