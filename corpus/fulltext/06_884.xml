1 The primary question for determination in this matter is the meaning of the word 'unemployed' as used in s 593(1)(a) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 Section 593 is the first section in Subdivision A of Division 1 of Part 2.12 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Part 2.12 is entitled 'Newstart allowance'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Division 1 is entitled 'Qualification for and payability of newstart allowance' and Subdivision A is entitled 'Basic qualifications'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Section 593 is itself entitled 'Qualification for newstart allowance'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 Under s 635(1) of the Act a person who wants to be granted a newstart allowance must make a proper claim for that allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 In the present case the respondent ('Mr Joss') made a claim for newstart allowance covering the period from 24 July 1997 to 22 January 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">At the outset, the applicant ('the Secretary') was not satisfied that throughout the period in question Mr Joss qualified for a newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">However, when the matter was before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the Secretary only submitted that Mr Joss was not qualified for a newstart allowance in respect of the period from mid September 1997 to 22 January 1998 ('the relevant period').</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">5 Between 1 September 1997 and 15 December 1997 s 593(1) of the Act relevantly provided:
 
 '593(1) Subject to sections 594 and 598, a person is qualified for a newstart allowance in respect of a period if: 
 
 (a) the person satisfies the Secretary that throughout the period the person is unemployed; and 
 
 (b) throughout the period, or for each period within the period, the person either: 
 
 (i) satisfies the activity test; or 
 
 (ii) is not required to satisfy the activity test; and 
 ...' 
 

6 Section 594 was repealed by the Social Security &amp; Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (Cth), Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">1 of 1996, but the reference to it in s 593(1) was not removed from the Act until the Act was amended by the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Act 1997 (Cth), Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">202 of 1997, Schedule 21 of which, containing the amendment, commenced on 15 December 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">7 Between 15 December 1997 and 22 January 1998 s 593(1) was expressed to be 'Subject to sections 596, 596A, 597 and 598' instead of 'Subject to sections 594 and 598'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">8 As it transpires none of the sections to which s 593(1) was subject had any application to the facts in the present case and no submission was advanced by either party to the effect that any of them qualified the meaning of the word 'unemployed' in s 593(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">9 In the instant case the Secretary does not contend that Mr Joss was required to satisfy the activity test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Were Mr Joss required to satisfy that test then, under s 601(1) of the Act it would be necessary for Mr Joss to satisfy the Secretary that throughout the period he was:
 
 '(a) actively seeking; and 
 
 (b) willing to undertake; 
 
 paid work, other than paid work that is unsuitable to be undertaken by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">' 
 

10 At all material times s 595(1) of the Act has empowered the Secretary to treat a person as being unemployed throughout a period in circumstances where the person has undertaken paid work during that period if the Secretary is of the opinion that the work should be disregarded:
 
 '... taking into account: 
 
 (i) the nature of the work; and 
 
 (ii) the duration of the work; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) any other matters relating to the work that the Secretary considers relevant;' 
 
 

11 In Re McKenna and Director-General of Social Services ('Re McKenna') (1981) 3 ALD 219 a three member bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, presided over by Deputy President Morling J, was concerned to determine whether the applicant Mr McKenna was 'unemployed' within the meaning of s 107(1)(c) of the Social Services Act 1947 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In that context the Tribunal said at 221 [11]:
 
 '11 The apparent legislative intent of the provisions of the Act concerned with eligibility for and payment of unemployment benefit is to provide those people who are not engaged in work of a remunerative nature with the means of subsistence in circumstances where, despite capacity, willingness and effort on their part, they have been unable to find paid work to maintain themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">When regarded in the context of the apparent legislative intent and the other terms and expressions used in the sub-section, it seems to us that the word "unemployed" bears its colloquial or popular meaning of not being engaged in work of a remunerative nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This meaning must ... be modified to allow for those special cases where a person is not engaged in work of a remunerative nature but whose commitment to some activity ... demonstrates a preference for that activity rather than employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">...' 
 

12 In the Macquarie Dictionary (A Delbridge et al.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">(eds), Revised 3 rd Ed, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, Macquarie University, 2003, p619) 'unemployed' is defined as:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">out of work, especially temporarily and involuntarily; without work or employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 2. not employed; not in use; not kept busy or at work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 3. not in productive or profitable use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 ...' 
 

13 In The Oxford English Dictionary (JA Simpson &amp; ESC Weiner (eds), Volume XIX, 2 nd Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1989) 'unemployed' is defined as follows:
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Not put to use; not applied to some end or purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">... 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">... Not engaged in any work or occupation; idle; ... temporarily out of work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 
 ...' 

14 When one has regard to the dictionary definitions and to the context in which the word 'unemployed' appears in the Act, the connotation suggested in the first of the Macquarie Dictionary meanings seems to be most apposite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">15 Such a connotation is consistent with 'not being engaged in work of a remunerative nature' as suggested in Re McKenna .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That expression which the Tribunal in Re McKenna said must yield to special cases might be better stated as 'not being engaged in work of a potentially remunerative nature'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Undoubtedly a person will be unemployed when they are without work or employment and that situation is both temporary and involuntary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 As Senior Member Hall of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal observed in Re Te Velde and Director-General of Social Services ('Re Te Velde') (1981) 3 ALN 111 at N114:
 
 'There may ... be further modifications necessary to the meaning [of the word unemployed] suggested in Re McKenna ... in relation to self-employed persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 

17 In paragraph 34 of Senior Member Hall's reasons (which were misquoted in McAuliffe v Secretary, Department of Social Security ('McAuliffe') (1991) 23 ALD 284 at 291) he said at N114:
 
 '34 ... Whilst the concept of "work" normally connotes some activity pursued as a means of earning one's livelihood, the absence of evidence that the activity is effective in producing a livelihood may not be critical in deciding whether the activity qualifies as "work": see Clear v Smith [1981] 1 WLR 399.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">A self-employed person, in particular, may be engaged full-time in activities intended to earn him a living, but which, despite his diligent efforts, fail to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Thus in Re Brabenec and Director---General of Social Services (1981) 3 ALN No 39, a self-employed miner engaged unsuccessfully in full-time prospecting for opals was held not to be "unemployed" within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As the Tribunal commented in that case, the opal miner was no more "unemployed" than any person setting himself up on his own in a profession, trade or business ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' 
 

 18 Re Brabenec and Director-General of Social Services (1981) 3 ALN 63 was a case where the miner had been working either at prospecting or mining for 40 to 50 hours per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, in the relevant period he earned no income whatsoever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">19 In Re Weekes and Director-General of Social Services (1981) 3 ALN 141 a three member bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal held that a person who was seeking to establish a business and who was not in receipt of any net income could not be regarded as 'unemployed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">At N142 the Tribunal said:
 
 '24 ... a person who is self-employed need not be profitably employed in the sense that the income from his activities exceeds his outgoings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There are many self-employed businesses, including professional businesses, which would not be "profitable" in this sense in the early stages of their establishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">But it could not be said ... that it followed that the persons involved were "unemployed" ...' 
 

20 In Re Malaj and Secretary, Department of Social Security ('Re Malaj') (1988) 15 ALD 333 a three member bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal addressed the question of whether Mr Malaj was unemployed in three separate periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Prior to the first period he had been engaged in an upholstery business in partnership with his brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">After he withdrew from the business, which continued to be operated by his brother, he repaired some seats for a cinema under a contract entered into by the brothers' business with the cinema during part of the first period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In the second period Mr Malaj had an arrangement with another upholstery business under which he organised for the upholstering of seats under contracts obtained by that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He did not personally carry out the upholstery work, but arranged for others to do it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For his efforts he received payments from which he in turn paid the workers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In the third period Mr Malaj, after a gap of some eight months, renewed the arrangement with the upholstery business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On this occasion he attended the premises of the upholstery business on a regular basis, supervising the upholstery work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">21 The Tribunal found that during that part of the first period when he was repairing seats for the cinema and throughout the whole of the second and third periods Mr Malaj had not been unemployed because he had been committed to income-earning enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It was further held that the Secretary's discretion to disregard his work and treat him as unemployed should not be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The legislation, in that case the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth), was held not to exist so as to provide a support scheme for people who were inadequately remunerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">22 In Re Malaj the Tribunal referred with approval to the question asked by the Tribunal of itself in Re Vavaris and Director-General of Social Security (1982) 5 ALN 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In that case Senior Member Todd held:
 
 'The proper question to ask, as was asked in Re Guse v Director-General of Social Services (1981) 4 ALN No 5 is whether the person in question is so seriously engaged in the conduct of a business as to lead to the conclusion that he is not unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">' 
 

23 He also held:
 
 'A person who organizes his running of a business so as to make himself available to work full-time for another employer is not necessarily unemployed ...' 


 
24 This approach was approved by a three member bench of the Tribunal in Re Malaj .</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">25 In respect of the first period mentioned in Re Malaj the Tribunal held at 336 
 
 '... whilst the applicant was assisting his brother to repair the theatre seats he was not unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The applicant was fulfilling a contract that had been entered into ... whilst he was still a member of the partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In any event, the applicant was engaged in full-time work in repairing those seats and was not able to undertake alternative employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">...' 

26 In relation to the second period the Tribunal found that the applicant was involved in the business of subcontracting and was therefore not unemployed within the meaning of the relevant section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">27 In relation to the third period the Tribunal found that it was obvious that the applicant was engaged in an economic enterprise to which he was committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It considered there to be no doubt that in the third period he was involved in a subcontracting business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Furthermore, there was no doubt that as he attended the workshop almost on a daily basis, he was incapable of obtaining other suitable employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">28 After discussing, inter alia, the cases referred to above, Von Doussa J, hearing an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, said in McAuliffe at 292:
 
 'The question whether the appellant was "unemployed" during the whole or part of the period when benefit was paid was essentially a question of fact and degree to be decided having regard to the above principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 

29 An appeal from the judgment of Von Doussa J was heard by a Full Court comprising Spender, Foster and O'Loughlin JJ (see McAuliffe v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1992) 28 ALD 609).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">At 614 the Full Court cited with approval the last-mentioned passage from the judgment of Von Doussa J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">30 McAuliffe was cited with approval by Mansfield J in Devriadis v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2000) 62 ALD 145 at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In Devriadis an appeal had been brought from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirming a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal that the applicant in that case was not unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The applicant and his wife were the directors and shareholders of Zorba Structural Steel Co Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The applicant was described as a 'working director' of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The appeal from the decision of the Tribunal was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In relation to the Tribunal's conclusion Mansfield J said at [42]:
 
 '... Its conclusion reflects its findings that the applicant was working for the benefit of Zorba in carrying out its normal business activities on a significant scale, albeit a scale reduced from its level of activities of previous years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

31 In addressing the question of whether or not a person is 'unemployed' for the purpose of s 593 of the Act it is not sufficient to confine one's consideration to the question of whether or not a contract of employment existed between the person claiming to be unemployed and a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Other situations which must be considered are those of the self-employed whether they be engaged in endeavours on their own account or as members of a partnership or of a joint venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">One might say that if a person is carrying on business or engaged in work with a view of profit, that person could not be considered to be unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">32 In the present case the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was satisfied that Mr Joss was unemployed in the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">On the hearing of an appeal by the applicant the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Tribunal consisted of Senior Member Hunt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In her reasons for decision of 13 January 2006 she said, inter alia:
 
 '[3] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">I have found there is insufficient evidence before me to conclude that Mr Joss was not unemployed when the applicant alleges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">... 
 
 [30] ... although the circumstances of arrangement with Mr Steenbuck are not clear to me, after careful consideration of the evidence before me, on balance, I am not satisfied that Mr Joss was not "unemployed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 CONCLUSION 
 [31] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Secretary has not put before the Tribunal sufficient evidence to substantiate its allegation that Mr Joss was not unemployed during the period for which it seeks recovery of an alleged debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">As a matter of fact and degree, the indications are that Mr Joss remained unemployed until he advised the Secretary of his commencing employment [which occurred on 22 January 1998]'
 

33 The error of law upon which the Secretary primarily relies is said to be contained in paragraph [22] of the Senior Member's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That paragraph provided as follows:
 
 '[22] The Secretary has suggested Mr Joss may have been self-employed throughout the period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This would not prevent him from being regarded as unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">For example, in Re Te Velde and Director-General of Social Services (1981) 3 ALN 111, Senior Member Hall said: 
 
 
 
 "A person might be self-employed whether or not engaging in fulltime activities intended to earn him a living but which, despite his diligent efforts, failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">" ' 
 
 

34 The applicant submits that the proposition that a person who is self-employed throughout a given period could also be regarded as unemployed is unsustainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">With great respect to the Senior Member this proposition does not bear analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In the case of people who undertake paid work during a period the Secretary may, under s 595, disregard the work undertaken and treat them as being unemployed throughout the period by reference to the matters for which the section provides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">However, that would be a case of a statutory power being invoked which contemplates that the Secretary can, in special circumstances, act in a manner which is inconsistent with the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I would understand the power conferred on the Secretary to so treat a person as being unemployed, disregarding the paid work that the person may have undertaken, as one which could be invoked in respect of both paid work as an employee and also paid work as a self-employed person whether on that person's own account, or as a member of a partnership or of a joint venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">35 It may well be that viewed as a question of fact and degree and having regard to the intensity with which a person applies him or herself to a particular enterprise, one may conclude that a person is not self-employed at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">But, once it be found that the person is self-employed it seems to me impossible to conclude that such a person was, at the same time, unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">36 The example provided by the Senior Member to support her proposition is Re Te Velde.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">As can be seen from the above analysis of that case it does not support the proposition that a self-employed person could still be regarded as unemployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The quotation attributed to Senior Member Hall simply does not appear in the report of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It may be that the Senior Member was endeavouring to paraphrase, albeit unsuccessfully, what Senior Member Hall had said in Re Te Velde.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">What Senior Member Hall in fact said, as set out above, was relevantly:
 
 'A self-employed person ... may be engaged full-time in activities intended to earn him a living, but which, despite his diligent efforts, fail to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 

This passage provides no support for the proposition that a self-employed person who is unsuccessful in his or her endeavours is unemployed within the meaning of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Such a person may, in the exercise of the Secretary's discretion under s 595, be so treated , but that is because such a person is not unemployed in fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">37 To enable the reasoning of the Tribunal to be fully understood it is necessary to quote certain passages from the Senior Member's decision, which contain such findings of relevant fact as were made, as follows:
 
 '[3] ... Mr Joss admits he travelled interstate to help select a boat for purchase by the person who paid his expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He also admits he spent some time organising repairs to the boat and received some repayment of expenses in connection with these activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">... 
 ... 
 [6] ... Mr Joss denies that he was productively employed during the relevant period as he was incapable of much activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">... 
 
 [7] ... Mr Joss ... commenced proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW against Hirena Pty Limited and Mr Gerhart Steenbuck for relief under section 106 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">... Mr Joss's applications ... show that Mr Joss sought a declaration or order that the contract entered into between him and the defendants on or about December 1996 was an unfair contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">... 
 ... 
 [9] Mr Joss admitted he spent a lot of time on the Zane Grey preparing it for survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He said he had marine qualifications which equipped him to do this and he went to the boat every day over a lengthy period working out what was needed to prepare the boat for survey .</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He said he spent time in the boat's office ringing people to discuss getting things fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He denied receiving any wages for this activity but gave evidence that he had received money for expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He incurred expenses by making many telephone calls from his mobile phone from the boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">He also needed petrol money for driving his vehicle to and from the boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 [10] Mr Joss said he had a contractual arrangement with a Mr Steenbuck concerning the boat .</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">His understanding was that Mr Steenbuck would supply funds and Mr Joss would get the boat ready for survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">They would then share the boat in partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">...They [referring to Mr Joss and Mr Steenbuck] went to Hamilton Island and also to Western Australia where they saw the boat that Mr Steenbuck, or his company, purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">They then arranged to bring it back to Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Joss said he was not paid anything over that period and did not expect to be paid, at least not there and then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Somewhere down the line, he expected to receive 50 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">
 
 [11] The boat came to Sydney by road and was damaged on the way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Mr Joss looked at the boat and listed the damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">He also had observed some things that needed attention when he saw the boat in W.A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He had already discussed with a broker certain repairs to be done before the boat came to Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">These repairs included fixing a leaking exhaust system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The leak was fixed but other repairs had not been attended to before reaching Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Mr Joss said he arranged for repairs in Sydney sometime around the middle of August [1997].</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">He then worked on the boat or in the office on board the boat sourcing equipment , except when he had his hernia and hip operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 [12] Mr Joss told the Tribunal that he did receive a large sum of money in settlement of his claim before the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He agreed that he had instituted his claim on 2 January 1999 when he and Mr Steenbuck had parted company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He had advised Centrelink around that time [referring to late January 1998, but later identified as 22 January 1998] that he was no longer entitled to disability support pension (sic) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">... 
 
 [13] ... Mr Steenbuck told the Tribunal that he was the manager of a small charter boat company and had employed Mr Joss towards the end of 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He said that his employment became a major job in 1997 when they purchased the boat and it was damaged in an accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">... 
 
 [14] Mr Steenbuck gave evidence that he paid Mr Joss a petrol allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">... 
 
 [15] When asked whether Mr Joss had informed him that he was no longer unfit for work and that his disability support pension [sic] had ceased on 21 January 1998, Mr Steenbuck said it was possible and that he was very surprised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">When asked again if Mr Joss told him when he was no longer unfit, Mr Steenbuck said Mr Joss had received wages before the date 22 January 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 
 [16] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">He [referring to Mr Steenbuck] told the Tribunal he had made cash payments to Mr Joss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He said he made some extra cash payments which were about $150 per week before the boat went into survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">He had later paid outstanding tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">He said that Mr Joss had specifically asked him to pay cash as he had a problem with his need for hip replacements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">... 
 
 CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS 
 
 [17] Mr Joss did receive a substantial amount of money by way of settlement through the Industrial Relations Commission NSW proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">This might give rise to an inference that Mr Joss was employed or self-employed as a partner in a venture in a similar way to claims made in his court pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The orders are ... no basis for reaching any conclusion as to the reasons why Mr Steenbuck and/or his company agreed to compensate Mr Joss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He [referring to Mr Steenbuck] has told the Tribunal that he employed Mr Joss and paid him wages throughout the period of concern to the Secretary but has produced no substantiation of these payments occurring until after Mr Joss declared to the Secretary that he no longer qualified for assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">
 
 [18] Mr Joss told the Tribunal that he was involved in the selection of the boat called the "Zane Grey" and in preparing the boat for survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">He denied that he was paid wages or that he was employed during the period the Secretary suspects he was overpaid Newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mr Joss said that he was finding something to do while he was unable to look for work due to his problems with his hips and hernia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He did not consider he was employed and had not sought wages until he was ready for real work but had received reimbursement for telephone calls made on his own phone and for petrol which he used in driving to and from the boat and activities connected with the boat project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
 [19] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The employer's [referring to Mr Steenbuck's company, Hirena Pty Limited] records ... show that Mr Joss was paid wages only after the time that the Secretary claims Mr Joss was overpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">... 
 
 DID MR JOSS QUALIFY FOR NEWSTART ALLOWANCE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 ... 
 
 [24] I think that there is a possibility that Mr Joss was self-employed if his legitimate expectation was that he would receive 50% of an enterprise connected with the boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">On the other hand, Mr Steenbuck gave conflicting evidence about the position and told the Tribunal that he employed Mr Joss in 1997 onwards and paid him wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Mr Steenbuck did not give evidence that Mr Joss was his partner.</sentence>

<sentence id="s326">I didn't class it as wages because the arrangement that we had was that I would be a partner in the business.</sentence>

 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Except for the period I was having the hernia operation and the hip replacement operation and 7 days after I came out of hospital with the hip operation so there was 5 days with the hernia and 13 days with the hip and I think there were about three or four Sundays where I did not work in that 4 or 5 month-period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">
 
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">How many Sunday's did you say?</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">
 
 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Four or five.</sentence>

 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">So in the period from mid August, when you get the boat to the date in January when you were considered fit to return to work, are we saying you have only had about 12 days and five --- 12 recuperation days and five Sundays when you weren't at work on the vessel?</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">
 
 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">No, that is not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">So what are you saying?</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">I am saying 5 days for the hernia operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Yes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">
 
 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">I went in and out the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Have five further days off so that is 5 days I wasn't at work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Then the following, I think it was 5 or 6 weeks later, I went in for a hip operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">I had 7 days in hospital, 7 days at my daughter's place, that is a total of 14 days in relation to the hip and I am saying that there were four or five Sundays between the time I picked the vessel up in the middle of August and the time of 22 January when I did no work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Those Sundays, the reason for not working on the Sunday was we never had the required equipment and what have you to do it and it wasn't convenient to go to the office and be using the phone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The office was shut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">During that period I did a lot of time at the office and not a great deal of time on the boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">
 
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The time in the office was that spent sourcing materials?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
 
 
 A, Trying to get quotes for different types of equipment, who was going to supply where, what, how, talking to the surveyor about what he was doing, arranging for a shipwright to do some work on the boat, that kind of thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">
 
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">So it is full on from mid August every day bar about 26 days?</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Something like that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">For two operation, recuperations and about five Sundays off?</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">
 
 ... 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">You said: 
 
 
 I wasn't doing my normal employment so I didn't say I was employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Is that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Well, my normal employment is captain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">I wasn't being a captain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">I was looking at problems involved in getting a particular vessel that Mr Steenbuck purchased, how to get it into survey to be able to do the things that he wished to do with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">From middle of August through to 22 January i was doing it in an advisory capacity and instructing the shipwright what to do and trying to find out about the different equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">That is not what I normally do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">I normally simply run a vessel or assist in the running of a vessel or repairing or whatever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">You did understand that you were employed by Mr Steenbuck, didn't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">No, I didn't class it as employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Like I said before, what we did, we agreed on a partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">He was supplying the money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">I was supplying the expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">From that vessel's operation, I was going to be a partner with him and the moneys derived from the business would be split between the two of us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">So did you understand it as business?</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">I understood as a partnership arrangement, that is what I understood right up until I went to see Mr Cassim and he said: well, this is legally this that and the other and we discussed different ways of submitting the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">That was when I believed the partnership thing was sunk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">
 
 
 ...' (emphasis added)
 

47 Mr Steenbuck also gave oral evidence before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">His evidence, under cross-examination by Mr Joss' counsel, included the following:
 
 
 'Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It was the case, wasn't it, that Mr Joss had told you that he is no longer --- was no longer unfit for work and that you would have to commence payment of wages after 22 January 1998, that is the case, isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Mr Grant Joss received wages before that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Did Mr Goltham keep a full and accurate record of all payments made to Mr Joss since Mr Joss became employed by Hirena Proprietary Limited?</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">
 
 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Did he?</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">I assume so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">That was his job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">
 
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The business records from your company, Hirena Proprietary Limited, reflect from 2 February 1998 that the company commenced to pay Mr Joss an amount of money per week which was a gross amount, that is right, isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Net amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">A net amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">That commenced on 6 February 1998, didn't it, and that net amount was $350, wasn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">$80 tax from memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">It included a payment of tax of $80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">It was a net amount and $80 tax was paid on top of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Those records are a full and accurate reflection of the payments that were made to Grant Joss from the time he began employment with Hirena Proprietary Limited, that is right, isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">It was made by an account- by a bookkeeper I paid for so I assume it was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">
 ...' 
 

48 It is apparent that the Tribunal accepted that:
 
 &#8226; Mr Joss was involved in the selection and purchase of the Zane Grey;
 &#8226; Mr Joss went to the boat every day over a lengthy period, including the relevant period, working out what was needed to prepare the boat for survey;
 &#8226; He worked on the boat or in the office on board the boat sourcing equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">

49 Mr Joss' unchallenged evidence was that in the relevant period he worked seven days a week for a minimum of 10 hours per day on the boat with the exception of five days for his hernia operation, 14 days for his hip replacement and four or five Sundays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">50 Mr Joss and Mr Steenbuck had conversations before the relevant period about the nature of the business relationship which would exist between them in relation to the exploitation of the Zane Grey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">These included conversations in which both parties used the word 'partner' or 'partners'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">That such a concept was raised was the subject of evidence from both Mr Joss and Mr Steenbuck.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">51 Mr Joss was of the opinion that the conversations had the effect of constituting the parties as partners in a business exploiting the Zane Grey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">52 Mr Steenbuck disputed that the legal effect of the conversations was the constitution of a partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">His understanding was that throughout the relevant period Mr Joss was a person who performed work for his company for wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">53 Mr Joss sought relief in respect of the contract he propounded in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">That matter was settled with the payment to Mr Joss of $75,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">54 Applying the above principles in relation to what constitutes a person being 'unemployed' within the meaning of s 593(1) of the Act to the findings of fact as made by the Tribunal, the only issue could have been whether Mr Joss was an employee of Mr Steenbuck or his company, or, a partner or joint venturer of Mr Steenbuck and/or his company throughout the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">55 Plainly, Mr Joss was not, during the relevant period, without work or employment in a situation that was temporary and involuntary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">If he was not an employee, he was undoubtedly carrying on business or engaging in work with a view of profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">He was undertaking work on the ship with intensity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">His physical disabilities may have precluded him from personally performing heavy duty work for much of that time, but that was not his responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">He was responsible for arranging for the boat to be repaired and brought into survey in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">His normal work was as a boat's captain, but that is not work that he was pursuing in the period in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">He was applying himself with great vigour to the job in hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">56 In the Secretary's Notice of Appeal to the Court the questions of law said to arise were expressed as:
 
 
 'a) Did the Tribunal misdirect itself in law when construing the meaning of "unemployed" in s.593 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ("the SS Act")?</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">
 
 b) Was it open on the evidence accepted by the Tribunal for it to find that the Respondent was "unemployed" for the purposes of s.593 of the SS Act at relevant times?</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">
 
 c) Did the Tribunal comply with its obligations to give reasons as required by s.43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ")?</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">' 
 

57 The grounds relied upon in the Notice of Appeal were expressed as follows:
 
 
 'a) The Tribunal at [22] of its decision stated that being self-employed "would not prevent him (Mr Joss) from being regarded as unemployed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">This is wrong in principle and the cases referred to by the Tribunal at [22-23] are contrary to that finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">
 
 b) On the Respondent's own evidence, which the Tribunal appears to have accepted in full, the only conclusion open to the Tribunal properly directed was that he was not unemployed at relevant times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">
 
 c) The Tribunal's reasons do not make findings of fact or explain in any comprehensible way why the Tribunal came to the conclusion it did, and as such are not reasons within s.43 of the AAT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">' 
 
 

58 In my opinion the questions of law do arise and should be answered as follows:
 
 (a) Yes
 (b) No
 (c) If the reasons of the Tribunal are so deficient that it is impossible to ascertain whether there was error in the decision-making process then an error of law will have been committed (see Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564).</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Dornan v Riordan concerned a decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, rather than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, however, the principles there enunciated are equally applicable to decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (see the Full Court's decision in McAuliffe at 614-617).</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">In Dornan v Riordan the Full Court comprising Sweeney, Davies and Burchett JJ, said at 568, 574 and 575:
 'It is ... impossible to understand from the reasons given by the Tribunal why it was that the Tribunal adopted the precise base that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">
 ... 
 ... there was in the present case a substantial breach of the Tribunal's duty to state the reasons for its determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">
 ... 
 ... the reasons are so deficient that it is ... impossible to ascertain whether there was any other error in the decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">
 ... 
 ... the Tribunal did not explain its course of reasoning ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">
 

59 It is important to remember, as the Full Court observed in McAuliffe at 616:
 
 'Important as the obligation to provide reasons for the decision is ... the reasons of the tribunal have to be read fairly as a whole and not over-zealously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The reasons of an administrative body are not to be subjected to a minute analysis with "an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error", to adopt the phrase of Lockhart J in Politis v FCT 88 ATC 5,029 at 5,032 ....</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The reasons of an administrative body are meant to inform and not to be reviewed by an eye seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">' 
 

60 In the present case the Tribunal undoubtedly left a number of factual issues hanging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">However, the reasons which were provided were sufficient to enable question (b) to be answered as I have indicated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Whilst compliance by the Tribunal with its obligations to give reasons may have been marginal in this case, I am inclined to the view that the deficiencies in those reasons did not, of itself, amount to an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">61 In the foregoing circumstances the appeal should be allowed, the decision of the Tribunal set aside and the case remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and decided again without the hearing of further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">62 I note that the applicant does not seek costs in respect of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">I certify that the preceding sixty-two (62) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
