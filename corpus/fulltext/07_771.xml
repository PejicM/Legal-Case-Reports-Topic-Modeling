1 These five applications are illustrative of a pattern of migration proceedings instituted in this Court which are an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applications were heard together on 9 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicants are Bangladeshi nationals who applied for protection visas which were refused by delegates of the Minister between 1998 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Each application is brought against a background of extensive litigation, which is detailed in relation to each matter in annexures to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicants have all previously challenged the relevant decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to affirm the decision of a delegate, in the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and in the High Court, on at least one occasion in each Court, and sometimes on a number of occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On every occasion, each applicant has been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">SZASP 
 
2 This is what purports to be a notice of appeal filed 31 March 2007 from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 16 January 2007: see SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant requires leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Federal Magistrate refused an application to reinstate the appellant's substantive application, which had been dismissed on 12 December 2006 in the absence of the appellant when he failed to appear at the first listing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The substantive application had sought orders that the Minister show cause why a remedy should not be granted under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") in relation to a decision of the Tribunal handed down on 27 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The application to the Tribunal was the second application to review the decision of a delegate to refuse to grant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The applicant had stated in a letter to the Tribunal that he was seeking a second review of the delegate's decision because of changed circumstances in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the second application on the basis that it had already discharged its functions to review that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">His Honour concluded that the Tribunal was undoubtedly correct and that the substantive application was doomed to fail were it to proceed to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">3 The draft notice of appeal identified four grounds, namely that the Tribunal failed to accord natural justice, the Tribunal made an error of law by identifying the wrong issue and relying on irrelevant material and/or ignoring relevant material, that the Tribunal failed to exercise jurisdiction or acted in excess of its jurisdiction, and the Tribunal decision was in bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In the absence of particulars, these grounds of appeal are meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 It is necessary to first say something about the applicant's attempt to seek a second review of the delegate's decision in the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Tribunal's conclusion that it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision, having already discharged its functions under the Act to review the delegate's decision, was correct: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Thiyagarajah [2000] HCA 9 ; (2000) 199 CLR 343 at [30] , Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [7] , and Jayasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs &amp; Anor (1997) 76 FCR 301.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal was also correct in finding that changed circumstances did not provide any legal basis for undertaking a second review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The avenue provided by the Act to take into account changed circumstances, at least potentially, is the Minister's power to permit lodgement of a further protection visa application under s 48B of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">SZBXA 
 
5 This applicant has an extensive history not only of instituting proceedings which are an abuse of process but also of failing to appear before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He failed to appear on three occasions in the Court below and again at the hearing before me on 9 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 On 27 February 2007, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 1 February 2007 dismissing an application to set aside orders of 19 December 2006: see SZBXA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 119.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">By process filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 10 February 2006, the applicant had sought judicial review of the Tribunal dismissing a second application to that Tribunal for review of a decision of the delegate refusing to grant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal decided that it had already discharged its functions, having already affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In the Federal Magistrates Court, the applicant failed to appear at the hearing of the Minister's motion for summary dismissal on 6 July 2006, and the Federal Magistrate dismissed the substantive application for non-appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The applicant then filed an application to set aside the orders of 6 July 2006, which was dismissed for non-appearance on 28 August 2006 when there was no appearance by any party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">An application to set aside the orders of 28 August 2006 was dismissed for non-appearance on 19 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On 1 February 2007, when the applicant appeared by telephone, the Federal Magistrate dismissed an application to set aside the orders of 19 December 2006 on the basis that he had not provided a satisfactory explanation for his failure to attend and that there would be no utility in reinstating the substantive application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">7 The draft notice of appeal identified the grounds of appeal as being that the Tribunal had failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act and that it did not follow proper procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Again, there are no particulars and no attempt has been made to identify an error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">SZAFD 
 
8 This is an application for leave to appeal filed 8 March 2007 from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 20 February 2007: SZAFD v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 182.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Federal Magistrate dismissed an application seeking judicial review of a decision of the Tribunal dated 7 January 2003 on the basis that the application was filed outside the prescribed time limit and the Court had no jurisdiction to extend time, by virtue of the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth) and s 477 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Federal Magistrates Court had previously dismissed an application for review of the Tribunal decision on 24 September 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">9 The draft notice of appeal asserted that the Federal Magistrate failed to find an error of law, jurisdictional error, procedural fairness and relief under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It also stated that the "grounds and relief" were "very similar" to Lee v Refugee Review Tribunal; Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It referred also to Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 195 ALR 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In his affidavit filed 8 March 2007, the applicant claimed that the Federal Magistrate did not consider his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He referred also to the fact that he was unrepresented in the proceeding below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Applicant NACS of 2001 
 
10 This is an application for leave to appeal filed 15 March 2007 from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 26 February 2007: see Applicant NACS of 2001 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 302.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Tribunal of 19 September 2006 that it had no jurisdiction to determine an application for review of the decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant a protection visa, having previously affirmed that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The applicant had indicated in a letter to the Tribunal that although the Tribunal had already reviewed the delegate's decision, his situation had changed such that he now faced a greater risk of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Federal Magistrate concluded the application was an abuse of process and ordered that no further application for review of the delegate's decision of any decision of the Tribunal in relation to the delegate's decision was to be made without further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Costs were awarded on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">11 The draft notice of appeal identified broad grounds of appeal and no particulars were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The grounds were that the Tribunal failed to accord natural justice, identified the wrong issue and/or relied on irrelevant material and/or ignored relevant material, failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act and/or acted in excess of its jurisdiction, and that the Tribunal decision was made in bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">12 It is apparent that this applicant also sought to raise changed circumstances when making a second application for review to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">As noted above, the Tribunal was correct in concluding that it had no jurisdiction to conduct a further review of the delegate's decision: see [4].</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Applicant S1000 of 2003 
 
13 This is an application for leave to appeal filed 28 March 2007 from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 8 March 2007: see Applicant S1000/2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 377.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application and found that the Tribunal had been correct in concluding that the Tribunal had already discharged its functions to review the delegate's decision, that decision having already been the subject of a decision of the Tribunal of 20 March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Before the Federal Magistrate, the applicant stated that he wished to put submissions to the Tribunal concerning changed circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">His Honour noted the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the application even if circumstances had changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">His Honour concluded that the application was an abuse of process of the Court, and that the applicant had instituted a vexatious proceeding, and had habitually, persistently, and without reasonable grounds instituted vexatious proceedings in that Court and other Australian Courts, pursuant to Rule 13.11(1) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">His Honour ordered, on the Court's own motion, that the applicant may not continue or institute any proceeding in that Court without leave, and that the applicant was not to file, and the Registry of the Court was not to accept for filing, any further application for review of the delegate's decision, either of the two Tribunal decisions, or any other decision relating to his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">14 The draft notice of appeal identified a number of unparticularised grounds, including that the Tribunal failed to exercise proper procedure and that both the Tribunal and Federal Magistrate denied the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The applicant also stated that the Court had not considered his financial status in imposing costs orders against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Again, in the absence of any particulars, these grounds are meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">15 At the hearing, the applicant in this matter sought, in effect, to raise changed circumstances as a basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction to conduct a further review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He complained that the Federal Magistrate did not look at his claim that his circumstances had changed since September 11 because he did not support terrorism and spoke out against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He submitted that under s 416 of the Act , an applicant is entitled to re-apply to the Tribunal if their circumstances have changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">16 This argument is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Section 416 provides:
 
 Only new information to be considered in later applications for review 
 
 If a non-citizen who has made: 
 
 
 
 (a) an application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision that has been determined by the Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; or 
 (b) applications for reviews of RRT-reviewable decisions that have been determined by the Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; 
 
 
 
 makes a further application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision, the Tribunal, in considering the further application: 
 
 
 
 (c) is not required to consider any information considered in the earlier application or an earlier application; and 
 (d) may have regard to, and take to be correct, any decision that the Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made about or because of that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 

17 As noted earlier, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review the decision of a delegate already the subject of an earlier Tribunal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Section 416 cannot apply in such circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">However, for completeness, it is convenient to note the role of s 416 in the legislative scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The section applies in circumstances where there is a valid application before the Tribunal and enables the Tribunal not to consider claims that were earlier considered by the Tribunal, where an application is made to the Tribunal for review of a delegate's decision not previously the subject of review by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Applicants are prevented from making further applications to the Minister for protection visas unless the Minister exercises his or her power under s 48B of the Act to permit an applicant to make a further application in particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">If the Minister exercises the power under s 48B , and the delegate refuses to grant a protection visa, s 416 of the Act will be enlivened if the applicant applies to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision, in relation to information which the Tribunal considered earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Section 416 of the Act also potentially has work to do in circumstances where the notification of a delegate's decision was not properly made and where applications for review to the Tribunal are not regarded as being out of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Visa status of the applicants and the bridging visa system 
 
18 The Minister was represented by separate solicitors in each of the matters at the hearing on 9 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I was informed by the solicitors that each of the applicants, other than the applicant in SZBXA , held bridging visas (and had earlier held a succession of bridging visas) although in the case of the applicant in SZASP , the solicitor appearing for the Minister was unable to indicate this conclusively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The solicitor appearing for the Minister in SZBXA , Ms Rayment, explained that the applicant in that matter had been an unlawful non-citizen for the past year, but had not been detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">19 In relation to the applicant in SZAFD , there was a period of over one year when the applicant had no legal proceedings on foot, namely between the refusal of special leave by the High Court on 5 August 2005 and the filing of a second application with the Federal Magistrates Court on 3 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The solicitor appearing for the Minister, Mr Reynolds, explained that during that period, the applicant held a bridging visa in connection with an application he made on 6 September 2005 under s 417 of the Act and a request made on that date pursuant to s 48B of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The s 48B request was finalised on 17 March 2006, and the s 417 application was finalised on 6 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He was then granted a further bridging visa pending resolution of the second application to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">20 Mr Markus, the solicitor appearing for the Minister in Applicant S1000 of 2003 also made a number of points or observations regarding the bridging visa system generally, as he was invited to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He submitted that delegates of the Minister responsible for considering applications for bridging visas do not have any power or were not in a position to make findings in relation to competency or the merits of judicial review proceedings brought by applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Typically, applicants apply for bridging visas at regional offices and provide process sealed by a court, whereupon the delegate decides whether he or she is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to a bridging visa, or at least whether the applicant is entitled to apply for such a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Very few delegates at that level have an opportunity, in practice, to consider whether a bridging visa should be refused on discretionary grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The process tended to favour applicants for bridging visas due to the presumption that people challenging decisions concerning substantive visas did so in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The Minister was also conscious of the need not to interfere with the ability of people to exercise their legal rights in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">21 I have been informed on previous occasions, and again by Mr Markus at the hearing of these matters, that a review of current arrangements regarding the granting of bridging visas is underway and that the issues I have raised now on a number of occasions are under active consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It is to be hoped that this results in an appropriate means of reducing the number of these cases, as these cases place a significant and unnecessary burden on judicial resources and the courts more generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Disposition of the applications and consideration 
 
22 The applications in each of the matters must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Were leave granted, none of the appeals would have any prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Each is also an abuse of the process of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">23 In the past six months, I have now had before me nearly 40 migration applications or appeals which are of the same character as these five and which can each be described as an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">By the time these applications reach this Court, it is not uncommon for ten or more judicial officers to have considered and rejected proceedings instituted by the applicants in relation to the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The applicants can have little doubt about the futility of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In the past many cases of the type dealt with in this Court have been the subject of special leave applications to the High Court, which, as far as I am aware, are invariably unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Often a further round of litigant is commenced at a trial level in the Federal Magistrates Court, within three weeks of the application being dismissed by the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">This creates the framework for the litigant to pass through the primary hearing and appeal process again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Experience would suggest that the dismissal of these applications will also lead to application for special leave in the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">24 It is a matter of concern that each of the present applicants, and those who institute like proceedings, have been granted bridging visas repeatedly and, as a consequence, permitted to remain in Australia and prosecute proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">One means of attempting to discourage or prevent the institution of proceedings of this general character is to make orders requiring prior leave of the court before further applications (either in relation to reviews of specific decisions or generally) may be accepted for filing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Such orders are commonly sought by the Minister's solicitors and are often granted, both in this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">As I have indicated to legal representatives appearing for the Minister on previous occasions, it is questionable whether this mechanism is effective in discouraging or preventing such proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Orders of this kind have been made in a number of the present matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In Applicant S1000 of 2003 , such orders were made on two occasions by the Federal Magistrates Court and on one occasion by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The burden of giving effect to such orders is placed on the registry of the relevant court, and in practice, the requirement for leave may merely create another opportunity for litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Additionally, the use of pseudonyms because of s 91X of the Act renders the registry's task more difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is doubtful whether the course of declaring an applicant a vexatious litigant, as occurred in Applicant S1000 of 2003 in the Federal Magistrates Court, is effective in practice as a means of addressing the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">25 An issue of relevance in the grant of bridging visas is of course the need to ensure litigants are not removed from Australia pending legitimate attempts to challenge decisions concerning their right to remain in Australia or the validity of their removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In Tchoylak v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 872 , an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in which the Tribunal found that the appellant was ineligible for a protection visa, the appellant had been removed from Australia by the Minister prior to the hearing before the Full Court of the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Court at [50] to [53] said:
 
 Although we consider that we must dismiss this appeal, we cannot allow the situation to pass without expressing our disquiet at what has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The material filed on behalf of the applicant suggested that there may have been several other recent instances where applicants for review in this Court have been removed from Australia by officers of the Department while their applications were pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Amnesty International claims that Mr Tchoylak case was the third occasion in recent times in which the Department had pre-empted the Court by deporting an applicant while his or her case was pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">When pressed by the respondent for particulars, Amnesty International referred specifically, inter alia, to Kopiev v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1831 per Sackville J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">There the applicant was removed from this country three days before the first directions hearing by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 
 The respondent has filed extensive affidavit material which casts doubt upon whether at least some of Amnesty International's claims are justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is neither necessary nor appropriate that this Court determine whether Mr Tchoylak's case represents an isolated instance, now never likely to be repeated, or whether it is but one of a number of cases where the Department has failed properly to discharge its responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">
 
 The respondent has offered an apology to the Court and, it may be inferred, to the applicant, for what has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">There is no suggestion, in the present case, that the applicant's removal from Australia was the result of anything other than a series of misunderstandings on the part of officers within the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">That, of course, is little comfort to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 The respondent must take responsibility for ensuring that no one is removed from this country while there are proceedings pending in this Court challenging the validity of that removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">We do not accept that any of the various subsections of s 198 of the Act , which impose a duty in the circumstances there specified to remove a non-citizen "as soon as reasonably practicable" can be invoked by the respondent to justify what occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">

26 The Court ordered that the Minister pay the appellant's costs (paid to the applicant's pro bono counsel) on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">27 Courts are entitled to take a critical view of the removal from the country of any person seeking to challenge the validity of removal where he or she has not yet exhausted all reasonable and legitimate avenues of review open to him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This is clearly the situation to which their Honours' comments at [53] were directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">No doubt there are also great practical difficulties in administering legislation in this area, and to closely monitor the circumstances of every individual who is potentially someone who should be removed from Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">However, it is difficult to accept that applicants who have repeatedly instituted unsuccessful and futile proceedings should be allowed to remain in Australia by the grant of bridging visas to continue the cycle of vexatious litigation in the Australian court system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It is also difficult to accept that the repeated grant of bridging visas in relation to such litigation is a necessary and unavoidable by-product of the need to protect the rights of individuals to prosecute proceedings in the courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 I have now also raised on a number of occasions, including at the hearing on 9 May 2007, whether the Minister should have his costs in these cases, where the Minister, or his Department and officers, have failed to remove the applicant from Australia assuming, absent a bridging visa, that would have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In the present proceedings however, I am prepared, with some hesitation, to make orders that each of the applicants pay the Minister's costs and where a fixed costs order has been sought, order that costs be fixed in the amount sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">29 I conclude by noting that almost always litigants in the position of the present applicants have been assisted by others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It may well be that the Department should take steps to identify these individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">If identified, costs orders and other relief might be available against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 I certify that the preceding twenty nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>

 ANNEXURE A: SZASP v MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP (NSD 129 OF 2007) 
 
1 The applicant arrived in Australia on 7 October 1997 and applied for a protection visa on 19 November 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">A delegate of the Minister refused to grant a protection visa on 21 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">On 8 May 1998 he applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He claimed to have been politically active in Bangladesh and to have been persecuted as a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision in a decision handed down on 22 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">2 An application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 October 2004: SZASP v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 657.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Federal Magistrate's decision also notes that the applicant first sought to challenge the Tribunal's decision by joining a class action in the High Court on 20 June 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">3 On 28 February 2005, the Federal Court dismissed an appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision: see SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 151.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The applicant then sought special leave to appeal to the High Court, which was refused on 3 August 2006: see SZASP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCATrans 403.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">4 On 16 August 2006, the applicant made a second application to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision of 21 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">On 26 October 2006, the Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction in the matter in view of its decision of 1 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The applicant then sought review of the second Tribunal decision in the Federal Magistrates Court by application filed 20 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicant failed to appear at the first listing date of 12 December 2006, and the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application for non-appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">On 16 January 2007, the Federal Magistrate refused an application to set aside the orders made on 12 December 2006: see SZASP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 56.</sentence>
