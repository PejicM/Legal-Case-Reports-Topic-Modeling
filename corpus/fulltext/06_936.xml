 Introduction 
 
1 Chemeq Limited (Chemeq) is a public company included in the official list of market for securities operated by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It owns intellectual property associated with an acrolein-based polymeric antimicrobial developed as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention and control of intestinal bacteria diseases in intensively reared livestock (the Chemeq Product).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The technology underlying the Chemeq Product has other possible applications including inorganic sunscreens, preservatives in cosmetics and human pharmaceuticals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 On 22 December 2004 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced proceedings in this Court against Chemeq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">ASIC sought declarations and penalties against the company because it had contravened the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) by failing to disclose to the ASX information material to the price of its shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 Following various interlocutory steps and discussions between ASIC and Chemeq, the number of contraventions alleged was reduced to two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The first of these concerned what might broadly be called cost overruns in the construction of a facility for the manufacture of Chemeq's product at Rockingham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">A figure of $25 million known to the market increased between February 2003 and April 2004 to $35 million, then $45 million, then $50 million without market disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The Second Contravention related to the effect of a patent obtained in the United States relating to a process for formulating the Chemeq product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The patent had no commercial significance, a fact which was not disclosed to the market in a material trading period between 6 and 7 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 Chemeq has admitted these contraventions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">ASIC and Chemeq both submitted that penalties of $150,000 for the First Contravention and $350,000 for the Second Contravention are appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The maximum penalty for which the law provides increased between the time of the first and second contraventions from $200,000 to $1 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">So although the First Contravention was the more serious of the two, the penalty proposed is lower because the maximum penalty applicable is significantly lower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 For the reasons that follow I am satisfied that it is within the power of the Court to make declarations that the contraventions alleged did occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On the Statement of Agreed Facts submitted by the parties, those contraventions are established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I am also satisfied, having regard to the relevant sentencing principles, that the penalties proposed are appropriate and will make orders accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Chemeq will also have to pay ASIC's costs of the proceedings agreed at $170,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The cost overruns in the construction of the Rockingham facility 
 
7 On 30 April 2002 Chemeq informed the ASX, in a media release, that it had begun construction of a commercial production facility at East Rockingham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">After announcing the raising of $5 million at $2 per ordinary share in placements to institutional and other sophisticated investors it added: 
 
 Additionally, Chemeq also announces that it has begun construction of its commercial-scale production facilities in Western Australia, budgeted to cost $25 million over a period of approximately 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The facility, located 40 km south of Perth at East Rockingham, is being built and financed in stages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The plant, on an 8-hectare site, will produce all requirements to 2006/7 and is being built to internationally approved US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 
 

8 Dr Graham Melrose, then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chemeq, was quoted as saying that the first commercial stage of the plant was due to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2003 with immediate sales to Asian countries planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Sales world wide would follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Chemeq product was one of those which it was said would be manufactured at the proposed facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 On 2 August 2002 Chemeq made a announcement to the ASX to the effect that it had raised approximately $8 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It said: 
 
 'Combined with earlier placements to other institutions and sophisticated investors, Chemeq has raised approximately $15.5 million this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">' 
 

 Each new share had carried with it one free option exercisable at $2.30 before 31 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The company expressed its optimism that the additional $8 million in options would be substantially taken up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The release then stated: 
 
 
 'The funds raised will be used for the construction of Chemeq's $25 million manufacturing facilities, which are being built and financed in stages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">' 
 

A release, on 9 August 2002, announced the raising of an additional $2.6 million from institutions and sophisticated investors, bringing the company's total capital raising for the year to $18 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 On 16 December 2002 in a further media release Chemeq referred to the manufacturing facility and said: 
 
 
 ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The eight-hectare site for the manufacturing facility has been granted all regulatory approvals for plant construction of total output 250 tonnes per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Currently, Chemeq is constructing infrastructure for 250 tonnes per annum output, including offices, laboratories, amenities, warehousing and formulation areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">At this stage of construction, flooring, concrete slabs including hydraulic and electrical services in the entire offices, laboratories, amenities, warehousing and formulation areas have been completed; except for the formulation areas, all walls have been completed and roofing structures begun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">' 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Construction is to FDA standards for veterinary manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">FDA regulations limit scale-up rate to 10-fold expansions between successive plants; on this basis, Chemeq is currently constructing a 20 tonne per annum process output --- with 200 tonne per annum planned to immediately follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This additional manufacturing capacity will be majorly funded by cashflows from the 20 tonnes per annum facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">' 
 
 
 

11 On 4 February 2003, Chemeq announced the raising of a further $10.6 million from option holders, bringing its total capital raising for the preceding 12 months to $28.6 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It said: 
 
 'The funds will be used for the construction of Chemeq's $25 million manufacturing facility, which is due for completion towards the end of first-half of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The manufacturing facility is being built on an 8-hectare site, to internationally approved US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 

Initial output from the manufacturing facility would be sold in South Africa and New Zealand where Chemeq had regulatory approvals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Australia, Asia and other international markets were to follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The potential global market was estimated to be worth AUS$10 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">12 A meeting of the directors of Chemeq was held on 10 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The minutes of that meeting record a discussion about Chemeq's relationship with Transfield, the contractor building the East Rockingham facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The minutes recorded, inter alia: 
 
 'Transfield are projecting a cost of $38m; Chemeq believes it will be $36m.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">' 
 

13 In a further media release and announcement to the ASX on 4 April 2003 Chemeq announced that it was upgrading and expanding its 20 tonne per annum manufacturing facility, currently under construction, for production of its veterinary drug.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Included in the announcement were the statements that: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The design of the manufacturing facility has been expanded and up-graded so that production will continue, uninterrupted during periods of maintenance and cleaning; 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The warehousing and formulation areas of the manufacturing facility have been increased, so as to accommodate future productive capacities of 750 tonnes per annum; 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Construction, already designed to FDA standards for veterinary pharmaceuticals --- has now been up-graded for potential manufacture of human pharmaceuticals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">' 
 
 

Chemeq announced that it had executed a new construction contract for its facility with John Holland Pty Ltd with no change in operational staff at the construction site --- those staff having been transferred to John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The anticipated schedules for the facility were: 
 
 
 ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">" Lock-up" in stages, beginning end April 2003; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Occupancy, in stages, beginning end July 2003; 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Commissioning, during August to October 2003 (saleable product is anticipated during this period).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 
 

14 On 20 May 2003 a further announcement was made by way of a status report on the construction of the manufacturing facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The infrastructure in the facilities had been upgraded to accommodate future productive increases of the 20 tonnes per annum process plant to 750 tonnes per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">15 On 25 June 2003 Chemeq announced that it had raised '... $25 million to fund upgrades and expansion of its manufacturing facilities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The money came from a placement of new ordinary shares at $5.35 to institutions and sophisticated investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It was to be partly used for previously announced upgrades and expansion of Chemeq' s 20 tonne per annum manufacturing plant then under construction as follows: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Expansion and upgrade, so that production would continue, uninterrupted during periods of maintenance and cleaning; 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Expanded warehousing and formulation areas of the manufacturing facilities, to accommodate future productive capacities of 750 tonnes per annum; 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Upgrade from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for veterinary pharmaceuticals to manufacturer of human pharmaceuticals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 

Chemeq also said: 
 
 
 'The funds will also be used to expedite the construction of an additional 200 tonne per annum plant as soon as possible, following the completion of the 20 tonne per annum plant within the facilities, due for commencement of commissioning in October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">' 
 

16 At some time prior to a meeting of the Board of Chemeq held on 25 August 2003, members of the Board were provided with a document entitled 'Chemeq Rockingham Production Facility Report for July 2003'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On page 2 of this document there appeared a statement that the forecast final cost of the facility was $45,561,000 of which $22,561,000 had been expended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The report stated: 
 
 'There has been an increase in forecast final cost of $2.6M even after allowing a reduction in contingency by $750k.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">' 
 

17 On 11 September 2003 Chemeq made a further media release and announcement to the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It reported that occupancy of infrastructure areas within the company's manufacturing facility had taken place and that validating and pre-commissioning of facilities had commenced on schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The announcement had continued: 
 
 'Costs of the manufacturing facility, originally budgeted at AUD$25 million for the 20 tonne per annum plant, will be increased, commensurately with the planned upgrade to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards and expansion of the facility to accommodate next stage development, as previously announced on 4 April 2003 and 25 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 Additional costs are expected to be in the order of AUD$10 million and will not be fixed until after the current, competitive tender processes for supply of equipment for the manufacturing facility are completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 Currently, Chemeq has AUD$26 million in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">' 
 

It is agreed that by 30 September 2003 Chemeq's management was aware that the anticipated construction cost of the East Rockingham facility was likely to be in the order of $50 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">18 On 5 November 2003 Chemeq told the ASX that it had exercised a right to purchase the land upon which its manufacturing facility was constructed for AUD$2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Construction of all the infrastructure to accommodate a production rate equivalent to 750 tonnes of active ingredient per annum was complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This infrastructure would support and formulate 20 tonnes per annum of active ingredient from manufacturing plant 1 and 200 tonnes per annum from manufacturing plant 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">19 On 12 December 2003 Chemeq announced that it had raised $20 million from its share purchase plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It stated: 
 
 'The funds will be used firstly, as working capital to finance production and inventory from Chemeq's first manufacturing facilities; secondly, to support the immediate planning and then first stages of construction of Chemeq's second manufacturing facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">' 
 

It is common ground that by December 2003 Chemeq's Board of Directors and its management knew that the anticipated construction cost of the Rockingham facility was likely to exceed $50 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">20 Chemeq's half year report for the half year ended 31 December 2003, submitted to the ASX, disclosed that the book value of its property, plant and equipment was $37.3 million and its total assets were approximately $72 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It identified its prime activity during the half year as the ongoing construction of its manufacturing facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Its loss to 31 December 2003 of AUD$4.169m represented a direct investment into supporting the construction activities and building the company's '... unique future as an Australian manufacturer and seller of its own patented, synthetic pharmaceutical drugs'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">21 In a quarterly cashflow report for the quarter ended 31 March 2004 published to the ASX on 30 April 2004, Chemeq stated that in the quarter ended 31 March 2004 it had made cash payments to the order of $13 million for the acquisition of physical non-current assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Factual background relating to non-disclosure of patent information 
 
22 On 16 February 2000 Chemeq made an application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to the Patents Office of IP Australia which identified the United States as one country in respect of which it sought to obtain intellectual property protection for an invention which was a particular method of formulating the Chemeq Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">23 Patents protecting the Chemeq Product comprise seven families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The PCT application was within one of those families and related to a specific method of improving the efficacy of the Product and its antimicrobial function by preparing it in certain alcohols through a series of steps involving particular temperatures and times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The PCT application was filed with the United States Patent and Trade Marks Office on 8 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The term of patent protection in the United States, as provided in s 154 of Title 35 of the US Code, is 20 years from the date of filing the application for the grant of a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">24 On 10 December 2003 Chemeq made an announcement in the media and to the ASX in relation to its patent approvals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The announcement stated, inter alia:
 
 'Pharmaceutical company Chemeq Ltd ... today announced that it has received approval of patents for its antimicrobials in USA, Europe, Australia, Eurasia and China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">
 
 This family of approved patents include claims protecting all aspects of Chemeq's technology under patent law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This gives Chemeq additional monopolies in manufacture and marketing of their antimicrobials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The claims include: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">New synthetic molecules 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Methods of synthesis of these molecules 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Compositions derived from the formulation of these synthesised new molecules 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Market uses of these compositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 
 
 
 "Importantly, these patents confirm Chemeq's key monopolies in the manufacture and marketing of our unique polymeric antimicrobial for use in pig and poultry markets, globally" said Dr Graham Melrose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chemeq Ltd.' 
 

After referring to the 'key US patent' Chemeq's statement quoted its Chairman Dr Melrose as follows: 
 
 '"Incorporating today's announcement, Chemeq will now have approximately 60 approved patents and 150 patents pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The approval processes on all patents pending are progressing satisfactorily and if approved, would give additional monopolies considerably beyond 2020.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">These processes which generally take in the order of six years in many countries are well progressed by Chemeq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In the meantime national and international patent applications protect our position during the examination processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">"' 
 

25 On 27 August 2004 Chemeq lodged a prospectus with the ASX for non-renouncable rights offer to raise $20.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">At par 3.7 of the prospectus it was stated: 
 
 'PATENTED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 
 
 Chemeq has been granted patents in more than 80 countries including the USA, and countries within Europe and Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Chemeq has more than 175 patents pending which, if granted, will take potential manufacturing and marketing monopolies beyond the year 2020.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Chemeq's key patents are comprehensive and cover molecules, syntheses, compositions and uses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">All intellectual property is 100% owned by Chemeq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">' 
 

26 On 28 September 2004 Chemeq was told by its patent attorneys that the patent seeking protection for the process of formulation in respect of which Chemeq had filed its PCT application on 8 November 2001 was to be granted by the United States Patent and Trade Marks Office on 12 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The term of the patent was to be 20 years from 16 February 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">27 On 6 October 2004 Chemeq issued 8,478,155 fully paid ordinary shares under its non-renouncable rights offer which closed on 27 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The number of its fully paid ordinary shares on issue thereby increased to 101,737,865.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">On the same day, Chemeq made an ASX media release under the headline 'PATENT GIVES PROTECTION TO 2020 AND DISTRIBUTION BEGINS'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The release opened with the statement that Chemeq:
 
 
 ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">[H]as been granted an additional US patent (previously pending only), which extends the company's exclusive protection in manufacture and marketing of its veterinary products in this country, to the year 2020.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">' 
 
 

The announcement went on: 
 
 
 'Granting of this patent means that no other party may manufacture or market Chemeq's CHEMEQ polymeric antimicrobials in the large US market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Already, Chemeq has been given expedited review status for the approval process of its drug (for pigs) in the US market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 Chemeq's technologies are protected by granted patents in 80 countries, plus approximately 175 patents pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The safety and efficacy of Chemeq's technologies have been established over several years, in registered independent international laboratories and successful R &amp; D and commercial field trials in a number of countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">' 
 

There followed under the heading 'Distributed Sales Order' reference to a small additional sale in South Africa of product manufactured in Chemeq's APVMA approved pilot facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 On 7 October the West Australian newspaper published an article including statements attributed to Chemeq that: 
 
 '"[T]he issue of the US patent was a major milestone in Chemeq's bid to sell its polymeric anti-microbial, which is described as a replacement for the use of human antibiotics as growth promoters in pork and poultry production into the lucrative US market" and "[I]t's a most important patent ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In a nutshell, to have these exclusive rights in the most important market is obviously a very big achievement and an important milestone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">"' (sic)
 

29 At the time of the announcement and the report in the newspaper the relevant US patent was known to Chemeq's management not to be material to Chemeq's commercial position in relation to the whole of its intellectual property portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">This was because: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The relevant US patent protected a particular method of formulating the Chemeq Product but not the Chemeq Product itself; 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It is difficult to detect an infringement of the intellectual property rights conferred by the relevant US patent and therefore difficult to enforce those rights, 


 
30 On 7 October 2004 in response to a price query received from the ASX, Chemeq told the ASX that the issue of the relevant US patent while significant from a technical perspective did not represent any change in its commercial position other than to extend its patent protection from 2016, which had been announced in December 2003, to 2020.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Statutory framework 
 
31 Chapter 6CA of the Act is entitled 'CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It came into effect on 11 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Amendments to its provisions came into effect on 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Prior to its enactment the continuous disclosure provisions were found in ss 1001A, B, C and D of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">These imposed a prohibition against intentional, reckless or negligent non-disclosure which are no longer elements of the prohibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Their removal reflects a widening of its scope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">32 Section 674 provides, inter alia: 
 
 (1) Subsection (2) applies to a listed disclosing entity if provisions of the listing rules of a listing market in relation to that entity require the entity to notify the market operator of information about specified events or matters as they arise for the purpose of the operator making that information available to participants in the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">
 
 (2) If: 
 
 
 
 (a) this subsection applies to a listed disclosing entity; and 
 (b) the entity has information that those provisions require the entity to notify to the market operator; and 
 (c) that information: 
 
 (i) is not generally available; and 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) is information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of ED securities of the entity; 
 
 
 
 
 the entity must notify the market operator of that information in accordance with those provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">' 
 

Subsections (2A) to (5) are not material for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">33 Section 676 explains the concept of general availability in relation to information: 
 
 '(1) This section has effect for the purposes of sections 674 and 675.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 (2) Information is generally available if: 
 
 (a) it consists of readily observable matter; or 
 
 
 (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), both of the following subparagraphs apply: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) it has been made known in a manner that would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information; and 
 (ii) since it was so made known, a reasonable period for it to be disseminated among such persons has elapsed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 
 
 
 
 (3) Information is also generally available if it consists of deductions, conclusions or inferences made or drawn from either or both of the following: 
 
 (a) information referred to in paragraph (2)(a); 
 (b) information made known as mentioned in subparagraph (2)(b)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">' 


 Section 677 provides: 
 
 
 'For the purposes of sections 674 and 675, a reasonable person would be taken to expect information to have a material effect on the price or value of ED securities of a disclosing entity if the information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of the ED securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">' 
 

34 The term 'listed disclosing entity' is defined in s 111AL of the Act thus: 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Act, a disclosing entity is a listed disclosing entity if all or any ED securities of the entity are quoted ED securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 (2) For the purposes of this Act, a disclosing entity that is not a listed disclosing entity is an unlisted disclosing entity .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">' 
 

The term 'disclosing entity' is defined in s 111AC thus:
 
 
 '(1) If any securities of a body (except interests in a managed investment scheme) are ED securities, the body is a disclosing entity for the purposes of this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">' 
 

The term 'ED securities' is defined in s 111AD: 
 
 '(1) Securities of a body are ED securities (short for "enhanced disclosure securities") for the purposes of this Act if, and only if: 
 
 
 
 (a) they are ED securities under section 111AE, 111AF, 111AFA, 111AG or 111AI; and 
 (b) they are not declared under section 111AJ not to be ED securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">'

 The importance of continuous disclosure 
 
42 ASIC made submissions in relation to the penalty question about the philosophy behind, and the importance of, continuous disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Among the materials it placed before the Court, was an ASX publication entitled 'Continuous Disclosure The Australian Experience' published on 20 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That report gives a useful overview of some of the relevant history and principles underlying the development of the continuous disclosure regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">43 In 1991 the Australian Companies and Securities Advisory Committee concluded that a statutory system of continuous disclosure would promote confidence in the integrity of Australian capital markets and provide benefits to market participants and management in various ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It would: 
 
 
 '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Overcome the inability of general market forces to guarantee adequate and timely disclosure by disclosing entities; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">encourage greater securities research by investors and advisors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">This ensures that securities prices more closely, and quickly, reflect underlying economic values; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">ensure that equity and loan resources in the Australian market are more effectively channelled into appropriate investments and that funds are withheld or withdrawn from poorly performing disclosing entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">This will promote capital market efficiency; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">assist debtholders (sic) in monitoring performance of disclosing entities and thereby determine whether, or when, to exercise any right to withdraw or reinvest their loan funds, or convert debt to equity; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">act as a further, or substitute, warning device for holders of charges over corporate assets, that breaches in covenants may have taken place, or the risk of default has increased; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">assist potential equity or debt holders of disclosing entities to better evaluate their investment alternatives; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">lessen the possible distorting effects of rumour on securities prices; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">minimise the opportunities for insider trading or similar market abuses; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">improve managerial performance and accountability by giving the market more timely indicators of corporate performance; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">encourage the growth of information systems within disclosing entities, thereby assisting directors to make decisions and to comply with their fiduciary duties; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">reduce the time and costs involved in preparing takeover and prospectuses (sic) documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">' 
 
 

44 As a result of concerns about corporate misconduct in the 1980s a need for enhanced disclosure by companies was identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993 contained provisions which enhanced periodic reporting requirements, and imposed disclosure obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The disclosure regime so introduced was described by the ASX as 'co-regulatory' on the basis that it relies upon the statutory application of the ASX Listing Rules in relation to disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">45 The legislative policy behind continuous disclosure was set out in the Second Reading Speech of the Minister for Administrative Services introducing the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992 into the Senate on 26 November 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He said, inter alia: 
 
 'An effective disclosure system will often be a significant inhibition on questionable corporate conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Knowledge that such conduct will be quickly exposed to the glare of publicity, as well as criticism by shareholders and the financial press, makes it less likely to occur in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 In essence, a well informed market leads to greater investor confidence and in turn to a greater willingness to invest in Australian business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">' 
 
 Parl Deb 26.11.92 at p 3581
 

46 The importance attached to the continuous disclosure provisions of the Act by the legislature is emphasised by the penalties for their contravention which have recently been significantly increased and their widened scope since 2002 which is now not limited to intentional reckless or negligent non-disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">That is not to say that elements of intention or recklessness or negligence will not be relevant to the penalty to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Procedural history 
 
47 On 22 December 2004 ASIC commenced proceedings in this Court seeking declarations and penalties in relation to eight alleged contraventions of the continuous disclosure provisions of s 674(2) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">A statement of claim was filed with the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Chemeq filed an appearance on 4 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Lee J made directions on 4 March 2005 for the filing of Chemeq's defence and any counterclaim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The time limits were extended by consent orders on 19 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">A defence was filed by Chemeq on 27 May 2005 together with a cross-claim for declarations that Chemeq was 'excused' from the various contraventions alleged against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">An amended statement of claim was filed on 17 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Chemeq gave discovery of documents in August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">ASIC was directed to give limited discovery in December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Other pre-trial directions were then given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In February 2006 the time limits for variation of these steps were extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">48 In the event the parties reached a compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">ASIC filed a further amended statement of claim reducing the number of contraventions alleged to two, the first relating to non-disclosure of cost overruns on the construction of the Rockingham facility and the second relating to incomplete disclosure of the commercial relevance of the US patent rights obtained in relation to the Chemeq Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Chemeq admitted these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">49 ASIC submitted that the appropriate penalties under the Act should be as follows: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In respect of the first contravention, 75% of the relevant maximum, being $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In respect of the second contravention, 35% of the relevant maximum, being $350,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Chemeq accepts that these are appropriate penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">


 The contraventions 
 
50 The first contravention alleged against Chemeq related to the non-disclosure of the Rockingham facility cost overruns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">ASIC sought a declaration, which in terms set out the particulars of the alleged contravention thus: 
 
 'Between 10 February 2003 and 30 April 2004 the defendant:

 (b) having information, being the Rockingham Cost Increase Information referred to in paragraph 17 of the further amended statement of claim, that by r 3.1 of the ASX Listing Rules ("Rule 3.1"), it was required to tell the Australian Stock Exchange Limited ("ASX")' 
 (d) did not notify ASX of the Rockingham Cost Increase Information in accordance with Rule 3.1, 
 
 
 
 when the Rockingham Cost Increase Information was throughout the period referred to: 
 
 (d) not generally available; 
 
 
 (e) information which a reasonable person will expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the fully paid ordinary shares in the defendant.</sentence>

51 Paragraph 17 of the further amended statement of claim described the Rockingham Cost Increase Information thus: 
 
 'Throughout the period from 10 February 2003 to 30 April 2004: 
 
 
 
 (a) the information that Chemeq expected the construction costs of the Rockingham facility to be:

53 The "US Patent Information" referred to in the asserted contravention was defined in par 24 of the further amended statement of claim in the following terms: 
 
 'The relevant US patent was to the knowledge of Chemeq's management not material to Chemeq in the context of the whole of its intellectual property portfolio because: 
 
 
 
 (a) the relevant US patent protected a particular method of formulating the Chemeq Product but not the Chemeq Product itself; 
 (b) it is difficult to detect an infringement of the intellectual property rights conferred by the relevant US patent and therefore difficult to enforce those rights, 
 
 
 
 and by reason of those matters Chemeq's management knew that the issue of the relevant US patent did not represent any material change in Chemeq's commercial position (" the US Patent Information ").</sentence>

<sentence id="s268">76 On 26 October 2004, the Chemeq Board met and approved a Corporate Governance Principles and Practices Manual which comprised a number of separate documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">One of them set out policy and procedure for continuous disclosure and ASX announcements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Several statements made in the separate documents comprised in the Corporate Governance Principles and Practices Manual deal with the company's continuous disclosure obligations.</sentence>

 (1) review the material information reported by Senior Management; 
 (2) determine, in consultation with the CEO and other relevant members of the Executive, whether any of the material information is required to be disclosed to the ASX; and 
 (3) coordinate the actual form of disclosure with the relevant members of management and its release to the ASX (as set out in item 4.3 below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Induction of Directors and Other Key Personnel

78 The policy went on at par 2.2 thus: 
 
 ' Your obligations 
 
 As soon as you become aware of information that: 
 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">is not generally available (ie the information in question has not been included in any Annual Report, ASX Release or other publication of the Company); and 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">which may be price sensitive (ie it is likely to have a financial or reputational impact upon the Company that may be considered material), 
 
 
 
 you must provide to the CEO and Company Secretary the following information: 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">a general description of the matter; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">details of the parties involved; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">the relevant date of the event or transaction; 
 
 
 .</sentence>

 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">the names of any in-house or external advisers involved in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">' 
 
 

79 The policy set out the disclosure obligations under ASX Listing Rule 3.1 and explanations of the terms used in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Exceptions to ASX disclosure obligations were set out in par 3.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The circumstances in which contravention could arise were set out in par 5, together with a statement of the penalties for such contraventions which could be imposed upon the company and its officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Mr Bosch's opinion of the Corporate Governance and Disclosure Systems 
 
80 Mr Bosch made the point that Chemeq is a small listed company which employed 15 people in 2002 and 29 in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">He said that from 2001 to 2004 the resources available to the company for considering fast changing governance matters or establishing and maintaining increasingly complex compliance procedures were very limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">He expressed the opinion that the company's compliance and governance performance had to be considered against that background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">81 Mr Bosch described the statement adopted by the Board on 5 February 2002 as a valuable step forward in the circumstances of the time particularly considering the size of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The minutes of the meeting of the Corporate Governance Committee of 25 August 2003 demonstrated a continuing attention to corporate governance matters and the desire to comply with the new ASX principles and recommendations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">He described the Corporate Governance Statement adopted on 25 August 2003 as 'a substantial improvement in the governance of the company'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">82 Mr Bosch pointed to the review of the Standard Operating Procedures concerning ASX announcements in October 2003 as a demonstration of Chemeq's concern about compliance in the area of continuous disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">In relation to the Corporate Governance Manual of 26 October 2004 he said: 
 
 'The corporate governance Manual, which was adopted on 26 th October 2004, and which presumably was produced with the assistance of the consultants, includes a number of separate documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">In my opinion they are thorough and detailed and, allowing for Chemeq's size and nature, cover the matters in the ASX Recommendations appropriately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">While not fully complying with all the 28 Recommendations of the ASX they set out a high standard of corporate governance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The statement "Continuous Disclosure &amp; ASX Announcements --- Policy and Procedure" makes clear the Board's commitment to compliance, the responsibilities of individuals and the processes to be followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">' 
 

Mr Bosch described the documents adopted in October 2004 as practical and workable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The statement on continuous disclosure in the Annual Report was 'clear, reflected appropriately the Company's obligations, and was likely to give confidence to shareholders and potential investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">'
 
83 Mr Bosch pointed out that the ASX website showed that Chemeq had made numerous statements between 2001 and 2004 in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">The numbers of statements thus characterised were as follows: 
 
 2001 33 statements
 2002 73 statements
 2003 54 statements
 2004 76 statements 


 The culture of compliance 
 
84 In considering the appropriate penalty for the contravention by a corporation of a regulatory requirement, whether it be a requirement imposed by the Act or the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) or other regulatory frameworks, it is relevant to consider whether the corporation has in place policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with such requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">85 The Court will consider the form and content of the policies and procedures and also the measures adopted by the corporation to ensure that they are understood and applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">A well drafted set of policies and procedures will mean little if there is no follow up in terms of training of company officers (including directors) and, where appropriate, refresher training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">In the present case there is provision for induction training but no clear evidence of follow-up and refresher training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">86 Compliance policies and procedures will not be effective unless there is, within the corporation, a degree of awareness and sensitivity to the need to consider regulatory obligations as a routine incident of corporate decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">This kind of general sensitivity to the issues underpins what is sometimes called a 'culture of compliance'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">It does not require a risk averse mentality in the conduct of the company's business, but rather a kind of inbuilt mental check list as a background to decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">This may be more difficult to achieve where, as in the present case, there is a positive obligation that is not related to any particular decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The conduct of corporate business may involve consideration of the many shifting circumstances that make up a dynamic business environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">To identify those matters, including changes in circumstance, which attract the obligation of continuous disclosure, may not always be a straightforward exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">There will be clear cases, and not so clear cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">There should be some process for ensuring that changes in circumstances or market information requiring disclosure are identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Absent a positive monitoring mechanism, the company's compliance system may leave open the risk of non-disclosure by oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">87 It must be accepted that there will be differing opinions in particular instances about what requires disclosure and what does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">From the point of view of proper risk management against the possibility of contravention, a conservative approach which favours disclosure is to be preferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Certainly those who play calculated risk games of non-disclosure in the shadow of the Rules cannot expect indulgence from the courts if their assessments are not accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">88 As appears from par 11 of the ASX Guidance Note 8 entitled 'Continuous Disclosure: Listing Rule 3.1 ': 
 
 'The integrity of the market is enhanced if continuous disclosure is carried out in the "spirit" of the Listing Rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">' 
 

This is also reflected in Listing Rule 19.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">
 
 
 

89 I am satisfied that, since the contraventions to which it has admitted, Chemeq has made substantial efforts to upgrade its compliance systems relating to continuing disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It may be however that consideration should be given to some mechanism for providing internal early warning to officers of the company of material information or change in circumstances that may require disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The principles informing penalty 
 
90 The pecuniary penalties which the Act applies are punitive in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Their character is not adequately described by the rather anodyne term 'protective' --- Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [35] --- [37], [41] --- [43] and [99].</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Consistently with the characterisation as punitive the object of the penalties is general and specific deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">That is the deterrence of those who might be tempted not to comply with the law and the deterrence of the particular contravenor who might be tempted to re-offend --- Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Donovan (1998) 28 ACSR 583 at 608 (Cooper J), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80 at 114 (Santow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">91 In Donovan Cooper J was concerned with the application of penalties under s 1317EA(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">He said of the section that: 
 
 'Its purpose in an appropriate case is to punish, but principally imposition of a pecuniary penalty is to act as a personal deterrent and a deterrent to the general public against a repetition of like conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">' 
 

The same approach was adopted by Santow J in Adler in which his Honour said (at [125]):
 
 
 'It is well established that the principal purpose of a pecuniary penalty is to act as a personal deterrent and a deterrent to the general public against a repetition of like conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">' 
 

92 In the context of competition law in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 (at 174 [17]) Finkelstein J said: 
 
 'In antitrust cases retribution has no real role to play.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Nor does rehabilitation, but for different reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Those who view retribution as an appropriate theory of punishment hold that the offender must be given some punishment because he "ought" to be punished: the "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" approach to criminality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The proponents of this view see some social satisfaction in a "just" punishment, perhaps because it can be regarded as repayment to society for the violation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">It might also be justified as suppressing acts of private vengeance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, society is moving away from using a punishment for retribution even in purely criminal cases and, to my mind, it has no role to play in relation to the punishment of a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">One difficulty is that if punishment is to be regarded as an exercise of morality, presumably there must be some relationship between the harm intended by the criminal act and the harm inflicted on the offender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">But as there is no measurable relationship between the two types of harm, there is no reasonable basis for choosing a particular penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Rehabilitation is a concept that has no useful role to play regarding corporations for one cannot rehabilitate a legal fiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">So, if the purpose of antitrust laws is to define certain socially intolerable conduct, deterrence must be the means by which a corporation is to be hindered from engaging in that conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">' 
 

The general approach thus outlined is also relevant to the imposition of penalties for breach of the Act particularly as in this case, breaches of provisions designed to maintain an informed market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">
 

93 The deliberateness of a corporation's contravening act or omission may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the risk of that corporation reoffending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">That is relevant to particular deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">When a corporation takes a calculated risk by intentionally or recklessly failing to disclose material information to the market, it may be inferred that there is a corporate culture which encourages or, at least, tolerates or permits decision-making which expressly or implicitly weighs the benefit of non-compliance against the risk if non-compliance is detected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">For such deliberate conduct, the risk associated with re-offending must be set at a high level by high penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">It is not necessary or useful to tread upon the shifting sands of moral denunciation in having regard to issues such as intention or recklessness in fixing penalty --- cf however, the helpful and comprehensive discussion of the issue, albeit with a different perspective, in the context of competition law penalties by Yeung K in Securing Compliance :A Principled Approach (Hart Publishing, 2004, at Chapter 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">94 Where non-disclosure conduct amounts to fraud by the deliberate non-disclosure of information calculated to affect decision-making by potential investors or creditors, the Court should not hesitate, as an incident of its penalty fixing process, to identify the unacceptable character of such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">However the continuous disclosure obligation imposes a duty not limited to abstention from intentional breach, or the avoidance of recklessness or carelessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Its possible contraventions will cover a wide range of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">In such a case it is preferable to find a common principle applicable to the full range of conduct by reference to considerations of deterrence rather than super-added qualitative considerations of uncertain provenance relating to the morality of the particular contravenor's actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Factors relevant to the imposition of penalty 
 
95 The factors relevant to the level of penalty for contravention of the continuing disclosure provisions of the Act may be identified in part by reference to the elements of the contravention set out in the Act where those elements accommodate a spectrum of possibilities affecting its seriousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The greater the seriousness of the contravention when measured by reference to those elements, the greater the harm that will be done if like re-offending should occur and the higher the penalty that should be imposed to minimise that risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Issues of deliberation, recklessness and negligence are also relevant to risk of recurrence and what is necessary to deter such conduct by the particular company and others in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">96 The presence or absence of compliance systems is of importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">It is desirable also that the Court, in fixing penalty, is made aware of the reasons for the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">This may enable it to determine whether there were inadequate compliance systems or whether the contravention involved aberrant disregard by an individual of relevant policies and procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The seniority of those in the company who were involved in the contravention is also relevant because it goes to the risk of recurrence and the extent to which their conduct is likely to be noticed by subordinates within the company and by others in the wider corporate community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The degree of damage, if any, inflicted on the market by the non-disclosure is relevant as part of the exercise of assessing the seriousness of the contravention and so the level of risk associated with re-offending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">97 The acknowledgment by a corporation that it has contravened the law, its cooperation with the regulator in that regard, the steps it has taken internally to avoid repetition and relevant changes in the composition of the board or senior management should also be taken into account in the kind of risk assessment that informs a deterrent approach to punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">98 It may also be relevant to consider the impact, if any, on shareholders when a penalty is sought against a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Penalties imposed on officers of the corporation for their part in such contraventions affect those officers alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Penalties imposed on the corporation may affect shareholders including those who have become shareholders on a set of assumptions induced by the very non-disclosure complained of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">In some cases it is possible also that creditors may be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Who then is being deterred when only the corporation is penalised?</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">I am not sure that there is a satisfactory answer to this concern within the present statutory scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">One might imagine that if a penalty is to be significant to a corporation it will also be significant to its shareholders in its impact on the capital which backs their shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">In a company with capitalisation as high as that of Chemeq, the impact on individual shareholders may be insignificant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The penalties that count most are likely to be those imposed on the responsible individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Nevertheless the law as presently framed requires the assumption that the contravening corporation is a person distinct from its shareholders and that it can be deterred by the imposition of appropriate penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">99 From the preceding discussion I extract the following factors relevant to the level of penalty for contravention of the continuous disclosure provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The list is non-exhaustive: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The extent to which the information not disclosed would have been expected to and (if applicable) did affect the price of the contravening company's shares (s 674(2)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The extent to which the information, if not generally available, would have been discoverable upon inquiry by a third party (s 676(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The extent (if any) to which acquirers or disposers of the company's shares were materially prejudiced by the non-disclosure (s 1317G(1A)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">The extent to which (if at all) the contravention was the result of deliberate or reckless conduct by the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The extent to which the contravention was the result of negligent conduct by the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The period of time over which the contravention occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The existence, within the corporation, of compliance systems in relation to its disclosure obligations including provisions for and evidence of education and internal enforcement of such systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Remedial and disciplinary steps taken after the contravention and directed to putting in place a compliance system or improving existing systems and disciplining officers responsible for the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The seniority of officers responsible for the non-disclosure and whether they included directors of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Whether the directors of the corporation were aware of the facts which ought to have been disclosed and, if not, what processes were in place at the time, or put in place after the contravention to ensure their awareness of such facts in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Any change in the composition of the board or senior managers since the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The degree of the corporation's cooperation with the regulator including any admission of contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">The prevalence of the particular class of non-disclosure in the wider corporate community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">


 The role of the Court where proposed orders are agreed 
 
100 When a regulator brings action to enforce the provisions of a public statute and agreed orders and penalties are proposed, it is not the role of the Court merely to rubber stamp them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">In this respect what I said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (1999) 161 ALR 79 is relevant in the present case (at 79]: 
 
 'As a general principle fair and appropriate settlements are encouraged to reduce the burden of litigation on both public and private resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Courts are frequently asked to play their part by accepting formal undertakings or making orders by consent which prohibit parties from certain conduct or require them to do certain things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Sometimes they are asked to impose agreed pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">In carrying out those functions, courts are conscious of the public interest in the settlement of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">They must also be conscious, however, that the laws they apply are public laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">It is in the public interest that, in considering agreements between parties requiring orders of the court, the court does not act as a mere rubber stamp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">What is proposed must always be scrutinised to determine whether the undertakings or consent orders are within power and are appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">' 
 

101 In relation to proposed pecuniary penalties, Burchett and Kiefel JJ said in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 (at 291):
 
 'There is an important public policy involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">' 
 

102 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 619 , Weinberg J referred to what he considered to be the 'somewhat undesirable practice on the part of the ACCC in presenting this Court with a specific figure as an 'agreed pecuniary penalty'' (at [32]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">While acknowledging that both the ACCC and Colgate had accepted that the figure proposed was in no way binding upon the Court, his Honour could not find a single instance when the Court had not in the past endorsed such a figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">His Honour went on (at [34]): 
 
 'It is difficult to imagine that the parties would propose a pecuniary penalty that is so clearly beyond the permissible range that the Court will depart from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">As the authorities presently stand, the Court is bound to impose an agreed pecuniary penalty, save in such circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">' 
 

His Honour acknowledged the importance of the principles enunciated in NW Frozen Foods and, in particular, the need for corporations to have certainty of outcome if they were to be encouraged to engage in negotiated settlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">He was bound by those principles and the well-established line of authority to accept that the Court would not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">His Honour said: 
 
 
 'However, there are dangers associated with this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">The Court may be seen, perhaps not altogether incorrectly, to act as a 'rubber stamp' in simply approving a decision taken at an executive level by a body charged with investigating and prosecuting contraventions of the Act, but having no role in actually imposing particular sanctions for those contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Negotiated settlements are an important vehicle for resolving complex matters such as those involving the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">It must be borne in mind, however, that there is a public interest in ensuring that corporations that engage of behaviour of the kind that occurred in this case are dealt with appropriately, and that proper recognition is given to the need for specific and general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">There are important parallels between the fixing of a pecuniary penalty under s 76 , and the ordinary sentencing process which is quintessentially a matter for the courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">' 
 

His Honour made clear that he was not critical of a joint submission between regulator and contravenor about what might be the appropriate range of pecuniary penalties to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">A submission couched in those terms could assist in achieving a measure of certainty and consistency of treatment with other like cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">103 I agree, with respect, with the remarks of Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In the end, however, no 'agreed penalty' can bind the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Consistently with NW Frozen Foods the Court will apply a principle of judicial restraint in deciding whether or not to make orders in the terms proposed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">But that principle of judicial restraint is not a self imposed constraint equating the role of the Court to one of judicial review of a sentencing discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Such a self imposed limitation could amount to an abdication of the duty that the Court has to exercise the jurisdiction which is invoked and the powers conferred upon it by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">NW Frozen Foods does not, in my opinion, confine the Court to the imposition of a penalty differing from the agreed penalty only where the agreed penalty would be outside the range of penalties which could be imposed in the proper exercise of a sentencing discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The restraint which is applied by the Court to regulatory settlements is informed by practical considerations which differ from the principles and criteria informing its judicial review function or the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in relation to discretionary judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">104 In this case, ASIC and Chemeq have proposed that certain penalties would be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Such a proposal, in my opinion, leaves it open to the Court to determine that some other penalty might be more appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In so deciding, the Court would apply the restraint principle to which I have already referred and not lightly come to a different outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Whether the penalties proposed are appropriate 
 
105 ASIC submitted that the first contravention ought to be considered as one of the most serious possible contraventions of a listed company's continuous disclosure obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">It pointed to the significance of the construction of the Rockingham facility to Chemeq's principal activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">That activity is the production and sale of the Chemeq Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Chemeq could not produce commercial quantities of the product and therefore achieve sales until it had completed the construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Moreover, its main physical asset was at all material times the Rockingham facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">106 ASIC submitted that Chemeq specifically represented to the market the expected costs of construction of the 20 tonne facility in April 2002 as being $25 million and in September 2003 as being $35 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">As at 31 December 2002 its total assets were approximately $16 million and as at 31 December 2003 its total assets were approximately $72 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">ASIC submitted that Chemeq's market capitalisation combined the value attributed by investors to its intellectual property, its physical assets and its ability to sell the Chemeq Product at a profit in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">During the relevant period Chemeq announced its intention to upgrade the facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">It continued to make announcements about the progress of construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">However, it did not announce the increased costs of the 20 tonne facility despite the statements regarding the costs of the facility referred to earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">107 The statement to the market in September 2003, referred to in the statement of agreed facts, was incomplete and failed to fully inform the market of the true position at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">ASIC submitted that, by way of contrast, during the relevant period, Chemeq frequently used ASX announcements to provide positive news for the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">In the result, investors were informed of the potential value of the Chemeq Product and of its plans for the future but not of substantial cost overruns in the Rockingham facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">They were serious and involved an increase in cost to build the facility from 40% to 100% over the amount previously announced to the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">108 The cost incurred in building facilities before Chemeq could start producing commercial quantities of its product were important factors that investors needed to know when deciding whether to acquire Chemeq shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">That cost represented the initial investment required which investors needed to weigh up against the expectation of a future income and the risks associated with that expectation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Moreover, ASIC submitted, the fact that Chemeq was experiencing significant cost overruns would have been relevant to investors' assessment about its ability to deliver on key milestones and on its planning and management capabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">The consequence was that the price of Chemeq shares during the relevant period may have been higher than it would have been if the information had been disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The uninformed market in Chemeq shares lasted for a period of approximately fourteen and a half months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">109 ASIC pointed out that during his period Chemeq raised approximately $40 million from investors for the purpose of funding upgrades and expansion of its manufacturing facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">32,389 trades were executed on ASX from 10 February 2003 to 40 April 2004 with a total of 39,978,393 shares traded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Chemeq had and has few, if any, institutional shareholders but attracted many small shareholders as investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">110 ASIC submitted that to give full effect to principles of specific and general deterrence the contravention required a penalty at or close to the maximum amount provided by the law in force prior to 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">It demonstrated a disregard of the requirements of the ASX Listing Rules and s 674(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">It was submitted that it is appropriate to demonstrate to Chemeq and to other listed companies that such disregard of their obligation will not be tolerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">111 It was submitted on behalf of Chemeq that it was reasonable to infer that at least some of the trading in its shares at least since its admission to the S &amp; P ASX 200 Index was index driven rather than because of any appreciation of its individual situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">There was no allegation that Chemeq or any of its directors or officers acted dishonestly or sought to profit or gain from the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Chemeq has not previously been found to have contravened the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Its failure to appreciate that it should have disclosed the construction cost overrun was said to be one of a lack of understanding, rather than a calculated attempt to deceive the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">112 Having regard to the facts outlined earlier, I am satisfied that: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The information not disclosed would have been expected to significantly affect the price of Chemeq's shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">The information was not readily discoverable upon inquiry by a third party and a fortiori by small investors of the kind that make up the bulk of Chemeq's shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">There is a reasonable risk that acquirers of the company's shares were materially prejudiced by the non-disclosure, although that risk is not quantified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The contravention was not the result of deliberate or reckless conduct by the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">It cannot however be dismissed as mere carelessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The directors and officers of Chemeq during the relevant period were kept informed of the cost overruns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">It simply does not seem to have occurred to them that this was a matter which required disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">This suggests that at the time the Board of Chemeq had a serious lack of appreciation of its obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">During the relevant period there do not seem to have been in place effective compliance systems in relation to the disclosure obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">However, those which have been put in place subsequently, whilst not beyond improvement, represent a substantially increased commitment by the company to meeting its obligation in this respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Responsibility for the contravention is to be located at the most senior levels of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The composition of the Board and senior managers of Chemeq has changed substantially since the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Chemeq has cooperated with the regulator and has admitted the relevant contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">There is no evidence as to the prevalence of the particular class of non-disclosure in the wider corporate community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">

113 In the circumstances, I am satisfied that a penalty at the higher end of the range is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Given the absence of any dishonesty, the cooperation of the corporation with ASIC, the review of its compliance systems and the change in composition in the Board and senior management, I am satisfied that the penalty as proposed, fixed at 75% of the applicable maximum, is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">114 In relation to the Second Contravention, ASIC submitted that it ought to be considered as 'moderately serious'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">ASIC submitted that the disclosure obligation arose as a result of Chemeq's own announcement of 6 October 2004 overstating the significance of the relevant US patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">That overstatement can be seen by comparing the admitted facts as to the commercial significance of the patent with the message conveyed by the 6 October announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">There was a significant increase, in the order of 58% in the market price of Chemeq's shares and the overstatement was likely to have contributed to that increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">115 Chemeq was required to make the announcement of 7 October 2004 in order to clarify the true position about the significance of the US patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It only made that announcement after a query from the ASX on 7 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">It did not immediately seek to rectify the position despite the obvious market response to its first announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">116 ASIC pointed out that the Second Contravention continued for almost two full trading days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">During that time about 7,000 trades were executed and 26,821,595 shares were traded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">By way of contrast, on 5 October only 522,680 Chemeq shares were traded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Following Chemeq's announcement on 7 October 2004 its share price fell substantially in the order of 15%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">117 ASIC submitted that the principles of specific and general deterrence required a penalty at, or close to, 50% of the maximum amount provided by the law in force after 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">It submitted that the events of 6 and 7 October demonstrated a continuing carelessness by Chemeq with respect to the accuracy and completeness of its disclosures to ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">It demonstrated a slowness to correct misapprehension of the significance of the grant of the US patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">118 Chemeq submitted that in considering the effect of the information on the market value of its shares it was necessary to take account of the fact that it had finalised the issue of 8,478,155 new shares on 6 October 2004 and that share price volatility commenced prior to the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">There was also other information contained in the 6 October 2004 announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Nevertheless Chemeq accepted, for the purposes of these proceedings, that some trading may have occurred as a result of its failure to promptly tell the market the US patent information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Chemeq also pointed to the absence of dishonesty in relation to the announcement and its admission of the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">It responded to the ASX query regarding the US patent within the timeframe stipulated by the ASX, which response 'cured the contravention'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">119 In my opinion, the matters referred to by ASIC in its submissions, which I accept, has justified a penalty at the level for which it contends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The same mitigating factors to which I referred in relation to the First Contravention apply in relation to the Second Contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">In the circumstances, a penalty for the Second Contravention of $350,000, being 35% of the relevant maximum is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Conclusion 
 
120 For the preceding reasons, I will make the declarations sought by ASIC and the penalties proposed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The Chemeq cross-claim will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">There will be an order that Chemeq pay ASIC's agreed costs of $170,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty (120) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
