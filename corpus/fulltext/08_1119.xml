<sentences>
<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The first respondent (Niugini Mining) has several cost orders in its favour against the applicant Mr Roderick Salfinger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The orders were made in favour of Niugini Mining against Mr Salfinger on 30 March 2007 (the Injunction Order), 29 August 2007 (the Adjournment Order) and 18 October 2007 (the Separate Question Order).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Niugini Mining now seeks orders pursuant to O 62 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules that the costs in respect of each of these three orders be assessed as gross sums.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 O 62 r 4 relevantly provides as follows: 
 (2) Where the Court orders that costs be paid to any person, the Court may further order that as to the whole or any part of the costs specified in the order, instead of taxed costs, that person shall be entitled to: ... 
 
 (c) a gross sum specified in the order; or
 
 (d) a sum in respect of costs to be ascertained in such manner as the Court may direct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">
 
 (3) The Court may make an order under subrule (2) at any time, whether or not an order that costs be paid to a person has previously been made or entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The Chief Justice has issued Practice Note No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">27, which is to the effect that an application under O 62 r 4(2)(c) must be accompanied by an affidavit stating the amount of the gross sum sought to be specified in the order, how the gross sum has been arrived at and how it is justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Such an affidavit has been filed in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It is the affidavit of Mr John Lobban, sworn 15 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The purpose of the rule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of the taxation process: Beach Petroleum v LV Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An order that costs be assessed as a gross sum does not require that any process similar to that involved in taxation should take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">However, the power must be exercised judicially and after giving the parties adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: Ualesi t/a Australian Empire Imports v Expeditors International Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Notice 
 
5 I am satisfied that Mr Salfinger was given adequate notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">There has been filed an affidavit of service by Mr Jeremy Ian Chenoweth, which is to the effect that on 15 July he sent the relevant papers to the applicant at two addresses in British Columbia, Canada, where Mr Salfinger formerly lived and one address in Mentone, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 One of the British Columbia addresses was located by searching for Mr Salfinger's name in the White Pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is also an address at which the Niugini Mining's Canadian agent served material on Mr Salfinger in a Supreme Court proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The other British Columbia address is an address used by Mr Salfinger in a previous affidavit filed in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Mentone address is another address used by him as an address for service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 On 16 July Mr Chenoweth also caused his secretary to send a copy of the documents to a Melbourne fax number, which is a number that Mr Chenoweth has used to communicate with Mr Salfinger previously in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 On the same day he caused the documents to be sent to a Canadian fax number, which he has also used to communicate with Mr Salfinger previously in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He also sent a letter to Mr Tom Glynn of Glynn's Lawyers, the firm which represented Mr Salfinger in the appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court, enclosing the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Glynn took instructions from Mr Salfinger as recently as 5 May 2008 in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 Also on 16 July Mr Chenoweth sent an email to Mr Salfinger at rod.salfinger@yahoo.ca enclosing the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That email address has frequently been used by Mr Salfinger to correspond with Mr Lobban and his firm in these proceedings and during the course of the appeal to the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Salfinger used that email address to correspond with Mr Lobban as recently as 5 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">10 Also on 16 July Mr Lobban sent a second email to Mr Salfinger at the email address mentioned serving further pages of the affidavit of Mr Lobban.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">11 At the date of Mr Chenoweth's affidavit none of the various letters and emails sent to Mr Salfinger had been returned to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">12 After the commencement of the hearing of the motion on 29 July, Mr Salfinger appeared on video link from Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He claimed that he had not received the documents, but that his mother had told him that she had received a bundle of papers in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Salfinger claimed that he had been at a remote location in British Columbia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">As I have previously found in these proceedings, Mr Salfinger is not a man on whom I could place any credit whatsoever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 I am satisfied that Niugini Mining has taken all reasonable steps to bring this matter to the attention of Mr Salfinger, including service on him of the relevant documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that these documents have come to the attention of Mr Salfinger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Bias 
 
14 Mr Salfinger also made an application that I disqualify myself on the grounds of apprehended bias, the main ground of which appeared to be that I had sat as the trial judge on the hearing of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's claim against Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd, the substantive judgment in respect of which was Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The further details alleged by Mr Salfinger in that respect are scandalous and do not bear repetition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I reject the apprehended bias claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Gross sum costs order 
 
15 One of the relevant factors determining whether to make an order for costs as a gross sum is whether the party required to meet the costs order would be likely to meet those costs: Sony Entertainment (Aust) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As stated above, the exercise of the rule contemplates:
 ...a much broader brush than would be applied in taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The gross sum can only be fixed broadly having regard to the information before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">( Sony Entertainment at [197]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 Counsel for Niugini Mining has submitted, and I accept, that the following factors lead to the conclusion that gross costs orders are appropriate in this case: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Niugini Mining is unlikely to recover any of its costs from Mr Salfinger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He has consistently sought to demonstrate that he lacks the financial means by which he might fulfil any costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Salfinger appears to have no real property assets in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">A significant number of companies with which he is associated have been deregistered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">He apparently resides in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He does not appear to be usually resident in Australia and his address for service in Australia that he has previously given in these proceedings is not his own residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">He has resisted attempts to locate and serve him with material in respect of taxation in proceedings before the Victorian Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He has consistently shown little intention to comply with court orders and directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">He has made repeated attempts to delay the progress of the matter at first instance and on appeal and in respect of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">To date Niugini Mining has not been able to recover any of its costs from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">17 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make gross sum costs orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Such an order may be made notwithstanding that previous orders have been made for taxed costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">18 As to the appropriate amount, Niugini Mining have had costs assessed by Hickey &amp; Garrett, legal costs consultants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It is apparent from the affidavit of Mr Lobban that the gross sum costs orders sought are significantly less than the amount of the costs actually paid by Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">There are a number of costs that have not been included in the assessments as they were not able to be determined at the time the files were submitted for assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The figures do not include counsels' fees for the three days of the actual hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In addition, there were significant costs thrown away during the course of defending the proceedings as a result of Mr Salfinger's non-observance of court orders and directions which are not reflected in the assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">19 The Hickey &amp; Garrett figures were:
 (a) in respect of the Injunction Order, professional costs of $7,475 plus disbursements of $9,299.72, a total of $16,774.72; (b) in respect of the Adjournment Order, professional costs of $1,094 plus disbursements of $75, a total of $1,169; (c) in respect of the Separate Question Order, professional costs of $48,661.00 plus disbursements of $32,965.77, a total of $81,626.77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">20 Accordingly I will order that: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr Salfinger pay to Niugini Mining pursuant to the order of 30 March 2007 the sum of $16,774 for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Salfinger pay to Niugini Mining pursuant to the order of 29 August 2007 the sum of $1,169 for costs
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Mr Salfinger pay to Niugini Mining pursuant to the order of 18 October 2007 the sum of $81,626 for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Associate:
