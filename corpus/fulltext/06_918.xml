 4 In late 1997, at a luncheon held by Dutch private bankers, Mees Pierson, David Hazlett became aware of the IS &amp; PL Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He instructed Cameron Brae's advisers, principally Hancock &amp; Associates, to make further enquiries about the IS &amp; PL Fund after which the directors of Cameron Brae carried a series of resolutions related to the contribution of $500,000 to the IS &amp; PL Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The minutes of the directors' meeting of 7 May 1998 contained the following record;
 
 'IS &amp; PL SUPERANNUATION FUND: 
 
 The Chairman tabled an Information Circular from International Superannuation &amp; Pensions Ltd, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked with the letter "A" ("the Circular"), in relation to IS &amp; PL Superannuation Fund ("the Fund").</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 The Directors considered the Circular and UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED as follows: : 
 
 FIRST RESOLUTION: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is in the commercial and business interests of the Company to become a Participating Employer of the Fund and to make contributions to the Fund for the purpose of the Trustee providing superannuation benefits as it thinks fit by way of distributions to Discretionary Class Members who are employees of the Company who have retired or become totally and permanently disabled pursuant to the terms of the Trust Deed of the Fund for the following reasons: 
 (a) the Discretionary Class Members to whom superannuation benefits may be paid from the Fund will be limited to selected employees of the Company who are invited by the Company to become Discretionary Class Members of the Fund: 
 (b) contributions by the Company will fund distributions which are only authorised to be made so as to provide for superannuation benefits to Discretionary Class Members who are employees of the Company who have retired or become totally and permanently disabled: 
 (c) it is apprehended that employees will only be invited by the Company to become Discretionary Class Members of the Fund and that contributions will only be made by the Company to the Fund when it is considered appropriate so as to fulfil one or more of the following objectives: 
 
 
 (i) reward successful personal performance and effort in the employment of the Company; 
 (ii) encourage and promote successful and/or improved personal performance and effort in the employment of the Company; 
 (iii) reward fidelity of employees of the Company; 
 (iv) encourage and promote greater fidelity of employees to the Company, including so as to encourage employees to remain in the employment of the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 (d) by virtue of Discretionary Class Members who become recipients of superannuation benefits and payment of superannuation benefits to any Discretionary Class Members remaining within the absolute discretion of the Trustee, the Fund is sufficiently flexible to suit: 
 
 
 (i) the circumstances, needs and individual performance of employees who are Discretionary Class Members, who can be paid different amounts and types of benefits or paid no benefits depending on such matters as the Trustee considers appropriate, including their respective financial needs and circumstances on retirement and their personal contribution towards the growth, performance and profitability of the Company's business; 
 (ii) the circumstances of the Company, since the provision of superannuation benefits from the Fund is not restricted to persons who are employees at the time a contribution is made but may include future employees and the general cessation of membership of the Fund on termination of employment takes into account departures from the Company's workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 (e) since the Fund is located and invests overseas and is managed by experienced overseas fund managers, it offers lower risk as a result of greater investment diversification through investment of superannuation benefits in international markets rather than investment of such benefits being restricted to Australia and therefore subject to the vagaries of the relatively small Australian market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 SECOND RESOLUTION .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">: 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That the Company apply to become a Participating Employer of the Fund and complete such documents as may be necessary in this regard and DAVID HAZLETT shall be authorised to sign any such documents for and on behalf of the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 THIRD RESOLUTION: 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">That the Company nominate selected employees as Discretionary Class Members of the Fund and make contributions so as to promote and foster the objectives set out in the First Resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">' 
 

 
5 At an apparently separate meeting of the directors of Cameron Brae on the same day, the following further resolution, according to the minutes, was carried;
 
 'The Directors UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED to nominate the person(s) named below ("the Prospective Member(s)") to become (a) Discretionary Class Member(s) of IS &amp; PL Superannuation Fund ("the Fund") on the basis that they are (an) Employee(s) and fulfil the necessary criteria for nomination for membership to the Fund as set out in the Company's standard Invitation to Become a Discretionary Class Member of the Fund and that they be requested to complete (an) Application(s) for Membership of the Fund:

 The issues for decision

 (i) Whether s 82AAE of the Act authorised a deduction from Cameron Brae's income of $500,000;
 (ii) Alternatively, whether that deduction was an allowable deduction under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act;
 (iii) Whether penalty tax imposed by the Commissioner in the assessment for the 1997 year of income was validly imposed pursuant to s 226K of the 1936 Act .</sentence>

36 The proceedings numbered VID 469 of 2003 raise for determination these issues in respect of the assessment of Cameron Brae's liability for fringe benefits tax for the fringe benefits tax year ended 31 March 1999:
 
 (i) Whether a fringe benefit was provided at the time when Cameron Brae made the contribution to the IS &amp; PL Fund;
 (ii) If so, how the relevant fringe benefit was to be valued;
 (iii) If not, whether the provisions of s 67 of the FBTA Act authorised the Commissioner to increase the fringe benefits tax amount applicable to Cameron Brae in the relevant fringe benefit tax year and thus the amount of fringe benefits tax payable;
 (iv) Whether the penalty tax included by the Commissioner in the amended assessment for the fringe benefit tax year ended 31 March 1999 was validly imposed.</sentence>

 The submissions 
 
37 The parties each made detailed written submissions in support of their separate cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It is convenient to examine each part of those submissions as it arises in relation to one or other of the issues identified above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Deductibility under s 82AAE 
 
 38 Counsel for the Commissioner contended that the contribution to the IS &amp; PL Fund was not an allowable deduction under s 82AAE of the Act because the discretionary provisions governing the IS &amp; PL Fund, in particular cl 53(b) of the Trust Deed, which is set out at [ 3 ] above, precluded it from coming within what is connoted by a "provident, benefit, superannuation or retirement fund".</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">39 Although that expression is not defined in the Act , Hill J in Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1 at 15 considered that assistance in understanding its meaning can be derived from this observation of Windeyer J in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (No.2) (1966) 40 ALJR 265, at 278:
 
 'There is no definition in the Act of a superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The meaning of the term must therefore depend upon ordinary usage, the attributes of a thing thus denominated being those which things ordinarily so described have...the connotation of the phrase in the Act must be determined by one's general knowledge of the extent of the denotation of the phrase in common parlance...I have come to the conclusion that there is no single attribute of a superannuation fund established for the benefit of employees except that it must be a fund bona fide devoted as its sole purpose to providing for employees who are participants money benefits (or benefits having a monetary value) upon their reaching a prescribed age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">' 


 
40 Hill J in Walstern also noted that a similar view of the meaning of the expression "provident, benefit or superannuation fund" had been taken by Kitto J in Mahony v Commissioner of Taxation (1967) 41 ALJR 232 where his Honour said, at 232;
 
 'There was no definition in the Act of 'a provident, benefit or superannuation fund', and the meaning of the several expressions must therefore be arrived at in light of ordinary usage and with only one piece of assistance to be gathered from the immediate context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Since a fund, if its income was to be exempt under the provision, was separately required to be one established for the benefit of employees, each of the three descriptive words 'provident', 'benefit' and 'superannuation' must be taken to have connoted a purpose narrower than the purpose of conferring benefit, in a completely general sense, upon employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Precise definition may be difficult, and in any case is unnecessary for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">All that need be recognised is that just as 'provident' and 'superannuation' both referred to the provision of a particular kind of benefit' --- in the one case a provision against contemplated contingencies, and in the other case a provision, to arise on an employee's retirement or death or other cessation of employment, of a subvention for him or his estate or persons towards whom he may have stood in some kind of relation commonly giving rise to a legal or moral responsibility --- so 'benefit' must have meant a benefit, not in a general sense, but characterized by some specific future purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">A funeral benefit is a familiar example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">' 


 
41 In the Commissioner's submission, the IS &amp; PL Fund is not, as far as it provides for Discretionary Class members, a superannuation fund because its governing deed does not provide that individual employees will benefit from the moneys set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Rather, the terms of the deed confer upon the Trustee an absolute discretion as to whether to pay any benefit to or for the benefit of a Discretionary Class member, when any benefit will be paid in relation to such a member in respect of whom a benefit payment event has occurred and the amount, proportion or value of any benefit which the Trustee may determine to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">42 It was acknowledged on behalf of Cameron Brae that the discretionary nature of the trusts on which funds are held under the IS &amp; PL trust was one of the matters which initially attracted it to contribute to what, it contended, was a superannuation fund within the meaning of the legislation because it was being established for the benefit of two of its employees, David Hazlett and Andrew Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">43 Counsel for Cameron Brae submitted that discretionary powers conferred on the Trustee by cl 53(b) in respect of Discretionary Class members are consistent with the provisions of superannuation funds generally, the trustees of which commonly determine the extent to which beneficiaries with interests in the fund will become entitled (see Lord Foscote writing extrajudicially in The Fetters on Trustees' Discretions (2002) 16 Trust Law International 214 at 214).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It was also submitted for Cameron Brae that the present right of a member of a superannuation fund is no more than an expectancy; Re Coram; Ex parte Official Trustee (1992) 36 FCR 250, at 254.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Nevertheless, it was pointed out, in the same submission, that, upon the occurrence of a benefit payment event in the present case, the catalogue of "benefit events" in cl 53(c)(i) reproduced at [ 3 ] above makes it clear that one or other or both of the employees would ultimately receive a benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">44 However, even if the IS &amp; PL Fund can properly be regarded as a superannuation fund for the purposes of s 82AAE, that will not be determinative of the question of whether Cameron Brae was entitled to a deduction pursuant to that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Thus, it is necessary to consider the Commissioner's further or alternative argument that a contribution to the IS &amp; PL Fund in respect of Discretionary Class members fails to qualify for a deduction under s 82AAE because the legislation requires the contribution to have been made for the sole purpose of making provision for superannuation benefits for employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">45 For the contribution to the IS &amp; PL Fund to be deductible under s 82AAE, the contribution must be "for the purpose of making provision for superannuation benefits for an eligible employee".</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In Walstern Hill J considered that the phrase "the purpose" in s 82AAE connotes a sole, rather than dominant or principal, purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">His Honour noted that this view was also taken by Pincus J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Roche (1991) 105 ALR 95 at 103.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">On the other hand, Hill J noted in Walstern that a deduction would not be lost if the directors of a taxpayer/employer incidentally took into account, in making a contribution, the tax benefits which the Act makes available where a contribution is made to a superannuation fund properly so-called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In such a case, it may be that the tax deduction is a consequence, rather than a purpose, of the contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">46 An examination of the evidence related to Cameron Brae's purpose in contributing to the IS &amp; PL Fund reveals that an actuating reason was the perception that an existing superannuation fund, the CBP Fund, which had been set up to provide superannuation benefits solely for David Hazlett, was "over funded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">David Hazlett's explanation of this perception occurs in these terms at par 10 of his affidavit sworn 30 November 2004;
 
 'In or about June 1993 Allen told me that the CBP Fund was "over funded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Allen explained to me that this meant that the Applicant should not make any further significant employer contributions to the CBP Fund because any extra benefits paid to me upon my retirement from the additional employer contributions would be taxed at the maximum personal tax rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He explained to me that this was largely due to the relatively low reasonable benefits limit ("RBL") that I was entitled to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Since June 1993 it has therefore been the usual practice of the Applicant only to make contributions to the CBP Fund to the extent considered necessary to satisfy the minimum level of contributions required for superannuation guarantee charge purposes and/or to cover expenses of the CBP Fund which have accrued in the year of the contribution or in prior income years, and not to make tax deductible contributions up to the maximum level allowed under Australian tax laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">...' 


 
 47 In the same affidavit David Hazlett explained the reason for nominating Andrew Hazlett as a Discretionary Class member of the IS &amp; PL Fund by referring to the fact that Andrew had worked part-time for Cameron Brae in 1998 and had become a full-time employee in 2001 ascending to gradually more responsible positions from then until 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The paragraphs of David Hazlett's affidavit sworn 30 November 2004 directed to the position of Andrew Hazlett include the following:
 
 '19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">At about the time the applicant made the contribution to IS &amp; PL Allen and I had been working on a succession plan for the Group which would see Andrew succeeding me upon my retirement or death if he was up to the task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Under that plan, Andrew started as a junior employee of the Applicant on a part time basis performing mechanical work on boat engines for BWM, the position he held when the Applicant made the superannuation contribution to IS &amp; PL in May 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 ......... 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In consultation with Allen, I planned that the Applicant's contributions to IS &amp; PL would assist in achieving the Applicant's objectives under the succession plan as the funds contributed to IS &amp; PL could be used to provide retirement benefits either for Andrew or me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The funds contributed to IS &amp; PL could be used to provide Andrew with an incentive to stay with the Group until his retirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Allen and I also believed that if things didn't work out with Andrew, then IS &amp; PL was structured in a way that the trustee of IS &amp; PL was not locked into paying Andrew any particular amount or level of benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If Andrew left the Group before my retirement, the Applicant could apply to the trustee to pay most or all of the superannuation benefits to me on my retirement in addition to any superannuation benefits that I could receive from the CBP Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">This flexibility appealed to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">' 


 
 48 An explanation for the nomination of David Hazlett and Andrew Hazlett as the beneficiaries of the IS &amp; PL Fund established by Cameron Brae's contribution of $500,000 to that fund is also to be found in the affidavit sworn 7 November 2004 of another director of Cameron Brae, Peter George Currie where this passage occurs;
 
 'The first I heard about the proposal that the Applicant should make a contribution to the IS &amp; PL Superannuation Fund was when David Hazlett raised the idea during a meeting at the Ingleburn office of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I recall discussing the proposal with Mr Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I recall that the Applicant relied on Mr Ken Allen for detailed professional advice in relation to the contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I also recall David Hazlett informing me at the time that Andrew Hazlett was a potential beneficiary of the superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">At the time I was aware that the Cameron Brae Pension Fund held benefits of approximately $1 million to which David Hazlett alone would be entitled on retirement, and that Andrew Hazlett had no interest in the Cameron Brae Pension Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">I was also familiar with the Applicant's cash and working capital position and I believed that it was capable of funding a payment of $500,000 to the IS &amp; PL Fund and that it was reasonable for it to do so for the benefit of David Hazlett and Andrew Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">' 


That evidence of David Hazlett and Mr Currie suggests that Cameron Brae had two related objectives which were not entirely consistent with an intention to provide superannuation benefits for either or both employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The decision to nominate each of David and Andrew Hazlett as members of the discretionary class established by cl 45(ba) of the trust deed attracted to any contribution made in respect of either of those employees the restriction contained in cl 22(a)(ii) of the trust deed which provides:
 
 'Discretionary Class Members shall not make, and the Trustee shall not accept, Contributions to the Fund from Discretionary Class Members in their capacity as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">' 


 
49 As the name indicates, "Discretionary Class Members" did not have a vested or assured entitlement to any payment out of the Fund even in the event of death, disablement or retirement from Cameron Brae after reaching a stipulated retiring age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The amount which each of David Hazlett and Andrew Hazlett should receive and, indeed, whether he should receive anything at all was entirely at the discretion of the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">50 Those circumstances strongly suggest that Cameron Brae's sole, or even its principal, purpose in making the contribution was not to make provision for either David or Andrew Hazlett or his dependants to enable him or them to cope with the exigencies of death, disablement or retirement from employment by Cameron Brae.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Had the making of such a provision been Cameron Brae's sole or main concern, it would have been more appropriate for David Hazlett and Andrew Hazlett to have been nominated as members of the "Original Class" of members of the IS &amp; PL Fund pursuant to cl 45(b) of the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">A nomination in that form would have secured to each member, upon his retirement at or after attaining the age of 55 years or upon reaching the age of 65 years, payment of the amount standing to the credit of his accumulation account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It would also have enabled each of David and Andrew Hazlett to have made "member contributions" to the Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">That facility is denied to Discretionary Class members by cl 22(a)(ii) reproduced at [ 48 ] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">51 It is true, as Counsel for Cameron Brae pointed out, that no part of the contribution which it made to the IS &amp; PL Fund has been lent back to Cameron Brae for use as working capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">That feature distinguishes the present case from Walstern where Hill J found, at 18, that the directors of the company had created a superannuation scheme in order to "give effect to their desire to take money out of Walstern to invest for their benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">" However, a purpose described in those terms is by no means exhaustive of those which may preclude a contribution to a superannuation fund or scheme from being one "for the purpose of making provision for superannuation benefits for an eligible employee" within the meaning of s 82AAE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">52 It may also be doubted whether a contribution to a fund administered with a view ultimately to providing benefits to a few of a wider class of employees in respect of whom the employer's contributions were purportedly made has been made for "the purpose" stipulated in s 82AAE; see Raymor Contractors Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1991) 21 ATR 1410.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">53 I am prepared, for the purposes of the argument, to give effect to the presumption erected by s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) that the words "for an eligible employee" in s 82AAE import the plural and do not require each contribution to be made for the benefit of a single, identified, or specific employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Nevertheless, if, in the present case, the contribution be regarded as having been made for the benefit of the two employees, David and Andrew Hazlett, it cannot, for the reasons already explained, be said to have been made solely for the purpose of making provision for superannuation benefits for them as a class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">That is principally because one Discretionary Member could be totally deprived by an adverse exercise of the Trustee's discretion of any payment out of the Fund despite having satisfied one or other of the requirements on which superannuation benefits are normally conditioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">54 I am reinforced in this conclusion by several further circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In the first place, there is no evidence that the directors of Cameron Brae gave any consideration, before making the contribution, to what would be an appropriate benefit to be provided to either David or Andrew Hazlett by way of superannuation, if and when he qualified for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It has to be borne in mind that, in 1998, David Hazlett was already aged 52 years and had, as Mr Currie has deposed, an existing entitlement on retirement to approximately $1 million from the CBP Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">I accept that a permissible motive for making contributions to a superannuation fund may be the attraction and retention of suitable employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It was therefore legitimate for the directors to structure a generous superannuation benefit for Andrew Hazlett in the event that he was "up to the task" of succeeding his father as managing director of Cameron Brae.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">However, for the reasons explained above, by nominating Andrew solely as a Discretionary Class member, the directors did not assure him of any superannuation benefit even if the succession plan were implemented as hoped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Nor was any attempt made to apportion the contribution to reward successful or improved performance or effort or fidelity by either David or Andrew Hazlett as contemplated by par 1(c) of the directors' resolution reproduced at [ 4 ] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">55 The sole shareholder of Cameron Brae has at all times been Fincove Pty Ltd as trustee of the D C Hazlett Trust, a discretionary trust of which David Hazlett and his family are beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I infer that, in 1998, the sole directing or controlling mind of Cameron Brae was that of David Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In the five years between 1997 and 2001 he had uniformly drawn a salary of, in round figures, $70,000 a year, a very modest remuneration for the managing director of a company claiming to work 60 hours a week whose taxable income (after claiming the disputed deduction) ranged in the same period between $376,700 and just over $1,577,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The evidence does not indicate how the after tax income of Cameron Brae was distributed to the beneficiaries of the D C Hazlett Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">56 In these circumstances, I find that the purpose of Cameron Brae in making the contribution of $500,000 to the IS &amp; PL Fund was to enable David Hazlett, and, if David Hazlett chose, Andrew Hazlett, to take money out of the company as what would be called superannuation benefits, it being recognised that David Hazlett's benefits under the existing CBP Fund could not be increased in a tax effective way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">It follows that the contribution was not made for the sole purpose of providing superannuation benefits for eligible employees within the meaning of s 82AAE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Deductibility under section 8-1 of the 1997 Act 
 
57 In light of the conclusion just reached that the contribution of $500,000 was not deductible under s 82AAE, it is necessary to consider an alternative argument advanced on behalf of Cameron Brae invoking s 8-1 of the 1997 Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The text of s 8-1(1) of the 1997 Act is set out at [ 20 ] above and provided for a deduction of a loss or outgoing incurred in gaining or producing a taxpayer's assessable income unless it was "a loss or outgoing of capital or of a capital nature".</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In Walstern, Hill J considered that the appropriate test to be adopted in applying s 8-1(1) is that set out in these terms in the joint judgment of Deane and Fisher JJ as members of a Full Court of this Court in Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1980) 49 FLR 183 at 208;
 
 'An outgoing will be deductible where, objectively, it is reasonably capable of being seen as desirable or appropriate from the point of view of the pursuit of the business ends of the business of the taxpayer and those responsible for carrying on the business so saw it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 


 
58 In the same joint judgment, their Honours observed, at 210, that the fact that the legitimate ends of a business carried on by a company might encompass what is in the personal interests of the directors or employees of the company does not prevent the outgoing from having been incurred in carrying on the business of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">59 In Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 5201; 51 ATR 629 Kiefel J held, in the circumstances of that case, where the taxpayer, which carried on a motor dealership, had contributed funds to an employee incentive trust, there was not the requisite connection with assessable income or the business ends of the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Rather, the advantage sought was to benefit the principals of the business in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In Walstern, the facts of the case warranted a contrary conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">60 In the present case, the purpose of Cameron Brae in making the payment to the IS &amp; PL Fund, which has been identified as serving its business ends, was to attract Andrew Hazlett to become a full-time employee of the company and remain in its employ until he should succeed his father as managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It is therefore necessary to determine whether the contribution made in 1998 could, objectively, be reasonably seen at that time as desirable or appropriate in pursuit of that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">I have not been persuaded that the contribution in the form and amount in which it was made could reasonably be regarded, looking at the matter objectively, as likely to advance the business interests of Cameron Brae.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Andrew Hazlett, at the time when the payment was made, was only 26 years of age and working as a part-time mechanic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">He had apparently not revealed by then any conspicuous commercial or administrative acumen so that his father saw him as succeeding to the position of managing director only "if he was up to the task".</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Moreover, as David Hazlett frankly conceded in the passage from his affidavit reproduced at [ 47 ] above, he and Mr Allen conceived that the contribution would be made in such a way that the so-called superannuation benefit would accrue to David Hazlett "if things didn't work out with Andrew".</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Nor could it seriously be suggested that, in 1998, a provision of a further superannuation benefit was appropriate or desirable to preserve David Hazlett's continuing involvement in Cameron Brae's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">61 A related consideration tends to the same conclusion, even if, contrary to my clear impression, the attraction and retention of Andrew Hazlett as a full-time employee were objectively capable of advancing Cameron Brae's business interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">That is the fact that, because the benefit under the IS &amp; PL Fund was only available to him contingently on the exercise of an unfettered discretion, the contribution to the Fund, when viewed objectively, was not calculated to achieve the desired end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">As already indicated at [ 53 ] above, as a Discretionary Member, Andrew Hazlett could be totally deprived of any payment out of the Fund by an adverse exercise of the Trustee's discretion even if Cameron Brae's avowed purpose of attracting and retaining his services were achieved by his succeeding his father as managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">62 Counsel for the Commissioner pointed out that Cameron Brae had surplus profits available for distribution in the 1998 income year and that the only employees whom it invited to join the new fund were its effective controller, David Hazlett, and his son, Andrew Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The economic benefit of the contribution of $500,000 could have been made available to either or both of them without their becoming Discretionary Members of the IS &amp; PL Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">63 Without particularizing them, Cameron Brae contended that the facts of the present case differ significantly from those in Essenbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Neither the objective circumstances nor the evidence of the subjective intentions of the directors of Cameron Brae suggest that the contribution was made by way of effecting a distribution of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Accordingly, it was submitted that the Court should follow the approach taken by Hill J in Walstern and treat the outgoing as having been incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income of Cameron Brae.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">64 In Essenbourne the taxpayer, on 30 June 1997, made a contribution of $252,000 to an employee incentive trust in which three brothers who worked in various managerial capacities in the taxpayer's business were each allotted an equal number of units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">It was said on behalf of the taxpayer that its purpose in making the contribution was to provide an incentive for one of the brothers, Sam Marino, to continue his involvement in the business as he had allegedly expressed a desire to pursue some outside activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Kiefel J held that the evidence was insufficient to make out that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Her Honour was influenced in reaching that conclusion by the fact that the three brothers were to share equally under the new employee incentive trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">She went on to say, at [33];
 
 'As against the prospect that Essenbourne's purpose was to tie Sam to the business, is that the brothers sought to share profits in a tax effective way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">I tend to the view that Sam Marino's position was not really a reason for the payment of the contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I do not accept as likely that he referred to there being an imbalance in the superannuation contributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">So far as concerns whether he was dissatisfied and wanted to leave the dealership, these are matters about which he could have given evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In these circumstances I conclude that his evidence in this regard would not have assisted Essenbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">A conclusion that the payment was simply to provide for the three brothers and at the same time to obtain the advantages outlined is more confidently arrived at.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">A sharing of profits by the three brothers does not have the necessary connexion to Essenbourne's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The outgoing is not deductible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' 


 
65 In my view, there are sufficient parallels between the present case and the facts in Essenbourne to warrant the same conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">It is true that Andrew Hazlett did not have the same length of service or involvement in Cameron Brae's business as Sam Marino had in that of Essenbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">However, as already indicated, the need for his attraction and retention was not as acute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Nor was it subjectively perceived by David Hazlett as a compelling factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Moreover, the discretion remained in the present case, which did not exist in Essenbourne , for the accumulated IS &amp; PL Fund to be distributed wholly or disproportionately in favour of David Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">As he candidly volunteered in the passage from par 21 of his affidavit quoted at [ 47 ] above, it was that element of flexibility inherent in the scheme involving the contribution of $500,000 which appealed to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">66 For these reasons, I have been unable to impute to Cameron Brae objectively, or its directors subjectively, the view that the contribution was desirable or appropriate in the pursuit of the business ends of Cameron Brae's enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">It follows that it is unnecessary to consider whether the contribution was of capital or of a capital nature within the meaning of s 8-1(2) of the 1997 Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Fringe Benefits Tax 
 
67 A distinctive feature of the FBTA Act is that it imposes tax on a "fringe benefit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">As defined in s 136(1) of that Act , which is reproduced at [ 22 ] above, a fringe benefit must, for the purposes of this case, be provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee by the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It must also be provided during the year of tax or provided in respect of the year of tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">As well, it must be provided in respect of the employment of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">68 Counsel for the Commissioner have contended that the contribution of $500,000 by Cameron Brae to the IS &amp; PL Fund was a fringe benefit because it involved the provision of a "property benefit" or a "residual benefit" to the employees, David and Andrew Hazlett, or to an associate of theirs, being the IS &amp; PL Fund itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">However, it will be clear from the analysis which I have undertaken earlier in these reasons that, until the Trustee of the IS &amp; PL Fund has exercised the discretion reposed by the trust deed, neither David nor Andrew Hazlett can be said to have been "provided" with a benefit of any kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">69 That, I consider, was the feature on which Kiefel J and Hill J respectively fixed in Essenbourne and Walstern as the criterion for the imposition on the presumptive employer of liability for fringe benefits tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In the latter case, Hill J observed, at [87]-[88];
 
 'As I have already noted, I would, as a matter of comity, follow the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless the case was either distinguishable or I was of the view that the decision was clearly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">On this point the case is not distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Further, far from being of the view that her Honour was clearly wrong, I am of the view that her Honour was clearly right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The definition of 'fringe benefit' in s 136(1) of the FBTA Act makes clear the importance of identification of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The benefit itself is one which is said to be 'in relation to an employee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The benefit is required to have been provided to the employee (or associate of the employee) and is required to be in respect of the employment of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The definition of 'property fringe benefit', (if that is the kind of benefit relied upon) requires relevantly provision of property to a particular person there referred to as 'the recipient'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The valuation formula relevantly here requires that there be a benefit provided 'to a person' in respect of the employment of an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Any contribution made by an individual employee is taken into account in determining the taxable value of the benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Although not relevant in the present case, the exclusion of a benefit otherwise deductible to an employee contemplates taking into account the specific circumstances of the employee himself or herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">
 It is not surprising that the legislation requires a link between the benefit and a particular employee (or associate of a particular employee) because historically the purpose of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act is to provide a specific means of taxing benefits which are a substitute for income to an employee and in respect of which the provisions of the 1936 Act and particular s 26(e) were thought to be defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Income tax is a tax upon the taxable income of a particular employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">While fringe benefits tax is a tax for which an employer is made liable and is payable at the maximum personal income tax rate, the theory of fringe benefits tax legislation is that it operates as a final withholding tax payable by the employer on amounts that essentially are or would be income of the employee: see Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 235 ; (1999) 90 FCR 274 and National Australia Bank Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 46 FCR 252 at 262 per Ryan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">' 


 
70 His Honour went on to hold, at [91] that, at the time when the trustee of the Walstern contribution made an allocation between the two presumptive employees, Ronald Medich and Roy Medich, there was a provision of property "namely the benefit in the trust fund constituted by the money which was tangible property so that there was a property benefit as defined in the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">" By contrast, as I have already pointed out, there has been no allocation by the Trustee of the IS &amp; PL Fund between David and Andrew Hazlett as Discretionary Beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Accordingly, neither of them can yet be said to have received, by reason of Cameron Brae's contribution, a benefit in respect of any year of tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">A similar consideration was regarded by Merkel J as decisive at first instance in Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] ATC 4,674 where, at the time when the contribution was made, no employees of the taxpayer had become beneficiaries of the incentive fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">71 At least equally significant in the present case is the fact, implicit in the findings made earlier in these reasons, that the contribution of $500,000 was not made by Cameron Brae in its capacity as the employer of David and Andrew Hazlett in respect of the employment of either of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">That finding was contrary to the contention of Cameron Brae that the contribution was by way of providing superannuation benefits to those employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Had that contention been upheld, the contribution would have been into a non-complying fund as defined in s 267(1) of the Act and so would not have been exempt from fringe benefits tax by virtue of s 136(1)(j)(i) of the FBTA Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">In this respect the present case is distinguishable from Caelli Constructions (Vic) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1467 where Kenny J found that payments made to a building industry redundancy fund were made in respect of the employment of each employee for whom a "Workers Account" had been raised in the books of the fund to which payments were credited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">72 Because the contribution provided no entitlement in the nature of a superannuation benefit to either David or Andrew Hazlett, but only an expectancy of a favourable exercise of discretion by the Trustee of the IS &amp; PL Fund, it cannot be characterized as having been made in respect of the employment of either of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">This feature assimilates the present case to Indooroopilly Children Services (Qld) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 734 and provides a further point of distinction from Caelli (supra).</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The contribution was made, as I have found, to establish a flexible mechanism for distributing, between David and Andrew Hazlett, surplus income derived by Cameron Brae in the tax year ended 30 July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The fact that it was expected, or hoped, that an entitlement in Cameron Brae to a deduction under s 82AAE of the Act or s 8-1(1) of the 1997 Act would render it tax effective is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">73 Merely because a benefit is provided by one person to another who happens, coincidentally, to be an employee of the provider, does not entail that the provision is one in respect of the employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">If it were otherwise, a gift, for example, by a father to his son who happened to be employed in the father's business, would be taxable as a fringe benefit whereas an otherwise identical gift to another child not so employed would not be exigible to FBT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">As Kiefel J observed in Essenbourne , at [56];
 
 'The link between the benefit and the employment of the employee is required to be sufficient or material: J &amp; G Knowles , ATC 4157-4158; FCR 409-410.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It arises because of the words "in respect of the employment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">A mere causal link with the employment of the employee will not be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Essenbourne submits that, at least until the issue of Bonus Units, there is not a sufficient connexion with the brothers' employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">It seems to me that the substantial link at this point is as between the payment and the deduction sought by Essenbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">It is not necessary for me to further consider the point for, in my view, the payment by Essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">' 


 
 74 For these reasons, I have similarly concluded that, in the events which have happened, the contribution to the IS &amp; PL Fund has not conferred a fringe benefit on either David or Andrew Hazlett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider the application of the anti-avoidance provisions in s 67 of the FBTA Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Cameron Brae's appeal in proceedings numbered VID 469 of 2003 must, accordingly, be upheld, the Commissioner's decision to disallow its notice of objection must be set aside and the objection to the assessment of fringe benefits tax should be allowed in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Penalty Tax 
 
 75 In the Commissioner's view, Cameron Brae attracted a liability to penalty tax pursuant to s 226K of the Act , which provides;
 
 'Subject to this Part, if: 
 (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
 
 
 (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the taxpayer, in a taxation statement, treating an income tax law as applying in relation to a matter 
 
 
 or identical matters in a particular way; and 
 
 
 (c) the shortfall or part, as the case may be, so caused exceeded whichever is the higher off 
 (i) $10,000; or 
 (ii) 1% of the taxpayer's return tax for that year; and 
 (d) when the statement was made, it was not reasonably arguable that the way in which the application of the law was treated was correct; 
 
 
 the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the shortfall or part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">' 


 
76 Section 222C of the Act provides that a matter is "reasonably arguable" if, having regard to the relevant authorities and the matter in relation to which the law is applied, it would be concluded that what is argued for is about as likely as not to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Section 222C(4) defines "authority" as including taxation legislation, material admissible under s 15AB(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (such as explanatory memoranda and second reading speeches), a decision of a court and a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">77 Counsel for Cameron Brae submitted that, if it were held that the contribution of $500,00 was not deductible, its contention that the contribution was deductible nevertheless satisfied the criteria for establishing a reasonably arguable position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The applicant relied on the guidelines for the application of s 226K outlined by Hill J in Walstern and endorsed by a Full Court of this Court in Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 213 ALR 450; (2004) 58 ATR 210; 2005 ATC 4001, at [108].</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">78 In Walstern, Hill J emphasised that, when considering whether an argument advanced by a taxpayer is about as likely as not correct, the decision-maker does so from the standpoint that the taxpayer's argument has already been found to be wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">It was therefore submitted on behalf of Cameron Brae, that the Court, having reached this point in its consideration, should be careful not to allow hindsight to affect its view of the merits of the taxpayer's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">It was said to be sufficient, as Hill J made clear in Walstern , if, after weighing the contentions for and against liability to tax, the balance is such that those advanced by the taxpayer can objectively be said to be one that "while wrong could be argued on rational grounds to be right".</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">79 I have not overlooked the caveat against hindsight which Hill J entered in his very clear explanation in Walstern of the application of s 226K of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">However, it should be apparent from the foregoing reasons that the contribution of $500,000 was not deductible because it could not be characterized as having been made for the sole purpose of providing superannuation benefits for employees of Cameron Brae or as having been an outgoing incurred in gaining or producing Cameron Brae's assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The inability to characterize the contribution in either of those ways reflected provisions in the IS &amp; PL Trust Deed, the existing superannuation provisions for David Hazlett, other circumstances personal to David and Andrew Hazlett and aspects of Cameron Brae's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">It was not objectively arguable that a different view could respectably be taken of any of those matters, particularly in light of the candid concessions made in some of the affidavits relied on by the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">On the other hand, the arguments for deductibility depended on a selective analysis of the trust deed, and a blinkered concentration on what were perceived to be the commercial advantages to Cameron Brae of attracting and retaining Andrew Hazlett's participation in the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the claim for the deduction reflected an application of the law which, when the claim was made, was reasonably arguable as having been correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Conclusion 
 
80 For the reasons explained between [ 38 ] and [ 66 ] and from [ 75 ] to [ 79 ] above, Cameron Brae's appeal against the disallowance of its objection to the amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1998 has totally failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">There will therefore be an order in proceedings numbered VID 419 of 2003 that the application be dismissed and that Cameron Brae pay the Commissioner's costs of that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">81 In respect of the assessment of fringe benefits tax, the dispositive orders have already been indicated at [ 74 ] of these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">There will also be an order in those proceedings numbered VID 469 of 2003 that the Commissioner pay Cameron Brae's costs of those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">I certify that the preceding eighty-one (81) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Ryan.</sentence>
