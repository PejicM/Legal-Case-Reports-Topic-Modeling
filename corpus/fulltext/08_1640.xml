 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 19 September 2008 I published reasons for judgment in relation to the substantive issues raised in these three proceedings: see Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 I directed the parties to attempt to agree on the orders to be made, including orders as to costs, and failing agreement to provide the forms of orders for which they would respectively contend and written submissions in support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Having failed to agree, they provided the forms of orders and written submissions mentioned, on which I have now heard oral elaboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 These reasons relate to the orders now to be made consistently with the earlier reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I will use the abbreviated forms of reference that I used in those reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">SEVERANCE 
 
4 The first issue raised concerns the effect of the success that Telstra had in the Request and Primus proceedings (not the Chime proceeding) in relation to the backdating issue: see Section F (Disconnection Charges, Backdating and the "No Charge Period") at [508]---[571] of the earlier reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">(For convenience the parties have used the expression "Ground F" and I will do likewise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">) The relevant grounds were 10(a), (b) and (c) in the Request proceeding and 4(a), (b) and (c) in the Primus proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Telstra submits that there cannot or should not be a severance in relation to cl 5A(i) of Schedule 2 of the final determinations in each of the Request proceeding and the Primus proceeding, and that the effect of its success in relation to that clause is that each final determination as a whole must or should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Request and Primus submit that there must or should be a severance, that is to say, that only cl 5A(i) should be set aside and that the issue of disconnection charges outside a MNM in the period 15 November 2006 to 22 August 2007 should be remitted to ACCC for determination in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">(For the remainder of these reasons I will refer only to the Final Determination, being the final determination in the Request proceeding, but my reasons apply equally to the final determination in the Primus proceeding).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 Section 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (AI Act) provides:
 (1) If a provision confers on an authority the power to make an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 nor a rule of court, then, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 ...
 (c) any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation, and so as not to exceed the power of the authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">(2) If any instrument so made would, but for subsection (1), be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 (3) ... 
 
 
It was common ground that these provisions applied to a "written determination on access" made by ACCC under s 152CP of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 Section 16(1) of the ADJR Act provides that on an application for an order of review in respect of a decision to which that Act applies, the Court may, in its discretion, make all or any of certain orders, including:
 (a) an order quashing or setting aside the decision, or a part of the decision, ...; (b) an order referring the matter to which the decision relates to the person who made the decision for further consideration, subject to such directions as the court thinks fit; ... [my emphasis] 
The proceeding was in one aspect an application under the ADJR Act for judicial review of a decision to which the ADJR Act applied (see [103] of the earlier reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Final Determination was a "decision" in respect of which s 16(1) gives the Court the powers set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 The question is whether, as a matter of discretion, the Court should now exercise the the power to set aside a part of the Final Determination, namely, the part in cl 5A(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 Telstra accepts that the position at common law is that severance is possible unless the Final Determination would, with the invalid part excised, have a different effect or operation in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">However, Telstra submits that severance is not possible in the present case because:
 
 
 (a) Ground F of its nature renders the entirety of the affected final determinations invalid; and 
 
 
 
 (b) appropriate orders could not be made to give effect to a decision by the Court that the final determinations are severable, because under Pt XIC of the Act it is not open to the ACCC to re-exercise the power under s 152CP while a (severed) final determination is in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 

9 I will deal with these two arguments in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Telstra's first argument: Ground F of its nature renders the entirety of the affected final determinations invalid 
 
10 In my opinion, Telstra's first argument should not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">11 Telstra submits that it should be assumed that it succeeded in relation to cl 5A(i) on all three of grounds 10(a), (b) and (c) (in the Request proceeding) and 4(a), (b) and (c) (in the Primus proceeding).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I proceed accordingly (see [513]-[518] and [570] of the earlier reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 In oral submissions, senior counsel for Telstra directed this first argument mainly to Telstra's ground 10(c) which was that ACCC fell into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Telstra submits that at common law the inevitable result of its success in relation to cl 5A(i) is that the entire Final Determination is a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Telstra cites in support Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 ; and Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 Telstra submits that its success on the other two grounds (failure to take into account a relevant consideration and procedural ulta vires) yields the same result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 Telstra also submits that the result is the same under the ADJR Act as at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">15 In my opinion, the authorities cited by Telstra do not preclude the possibility of severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">None of them raised an issue of severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">16 Contrary to Telstra's submission, the authorities show that where there has been an invalid exercise of an administrative power, including on the ground of jurisdictional error, the Court will consider whether it is appropriate to find a severable valid exercise of power: cf Biyiksiz v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 352 at 12; Re Australian Industrial Relations Commission; Ex parte Smith [2004] FCAFC 271 at [85] - [88] ; Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24 ; (2008) 166 FCR 91 at [97] - [107] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">17 It is true that the whole of the Final Determination is "a written determination on access by the access seeker to the declared service": see s 152CP(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It is also true that subject to s 152DNA's provision in relation to backdating, the obligations imposed by s 152CR(1) and s 152AQA(6) apply generally to the making of the whole of the Final Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, this does not demonstrate a legislative intention to exclude the possibility of severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Indeed, s 152DNA suggests that the legislature regarded the operation of a Final Determination in relation to a period prior to the date 21 days after the determination is made (see s 152DN(1)) as different or potentially different from the provisions of a Final Determination to operate after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">18 The structure of the Final Determination invites severance of cl 5A(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Clause 7 of the Final Determination categorises the terms and conditions of access as follows:
 
 
 (a) LSS annual charges, as per Schedule 1;
 (b) LSS single connection and disconnection charges, as per Schedule 2;
 (c) Terms and conditions to apply to a Managed Migration Network (MNM) involving the LSS, as per Schedule 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 

(I note that cl 7 in the Primus final determination does not contain identical wording to cl 7 of the Final Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">However, importantly, like the Final Determination, it categorises the terms and conditions of access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">)
 
19 Schedule 2 is divided into three parts headed:
 
 
 LSS 'single' connection charges 
 LSS 'single' disconnection charges 
 Definitions 
 
 

20 Under the second of these headings are cll 5, 5A, 6 and 7, which were set out at [419] of the earlier reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The general provision as to the amount of charge payable for the disconnection of a LSS outside of a MNM is found in cl 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">21 It is cl 5A that deals with the circumstances in which a disconnection charge is not payable at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The two categories of circumstances in which a disconnection charge is not payable are set out respectively in paras (i) and (ii) of cl 5A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Not only are they structurally separated, but the course of reasoning that gave rise to them differs as between the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In the FD Statement of Reasons, after dealing with disconnection charges, the churn process and "Option 2", and expressing the conclusion that the resulting arrangements should apply from the time the Final Determination took effect (22 August 2007) until 31 December 2007, ACCC stated in relation to the period before 22 August 2007:
 Until 15 November 2006, charges will be payable on all LSS disconnections, as the Commission considers that it was likely to have been reasonable for a LSS churn process not to be implemented before this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">For the period between 15 November 2006 until the time the final determination takes effect, no disconnection charges will be payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">This maintains the position taken at the interim determination stage in the absence of a Telstra LSS churn process, and Telstra's advice that in practice those arrangements did not support Telstra applying charges for any LSS disconnections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">22 In sum, both the structure of the Final Determination and the FD Statement of Reasons demonstrates that ACCC was treating the question of charges to be made for disconnections effected prior to 22 August 2007 as a discrete self-contained matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">23 At common law, a provision is severable if it is a straightforward matter to isolate it from the remaining provisions and the remaining provisions are not affected in their meaning and operation by severing the invalid part: cf Harrington v Lowe (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 327-8; Evans v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 at [61] --- [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The common law test is satisfied in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">24 Section 46 of the AI Act (set out at [5] above) requires severance, because the structure and effect of the Final Determination clearly expose "the extent" to which the Final Determination is and the extent to which it is not in excess of power: cf Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner [1995] HCA 16 ; (1995) 183 CLR 323 at 347-348 per Dawson J; Evans v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 at [63] --- [65].</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">25 It is not to the point that I upheld Telstra's challenge in so far as it attacked cl 5A(i) on the ground that ACCC had not complied with provisions (ss 152CR(1) and 152AQA(6)) that applied generally to the making of the Final Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">To hold that those provisions applied to the issue dealt with in cl 5A(i) just as they applied to other aspects of the Final Determination explains why cl 5A(i) was to be set aside but does not address the issue of severability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">26 Telstra relies on the decision of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) (2007) 99 ALD 268 ( Telstra v ACCC (No 3) ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That case concerned a Pt A competition notice issued by ACCC under s 151AKA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Section 151AKA(10) provided, relevantly, that ACCC must not issue such a notice unless it had first given the addressee carrier or carriage service provider a written notice inviting it to make a submission to ACCC on the proposal to issue the Pt A competition notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">27 In her earlier reasons ( Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) (2008) 240 ALR 135) her Honour had held that a notice of invitation in purported compliance with s 151AKA(10)(a) that ACCC had in fact given to Telstra differed from the later Pt A competition notice in its subject-matter and the kind of anti-competitive conduct it described, as a result of which Telstra had been denied procedural fairness and natural justice under the Act and at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">28 In Telstra v ACCC (No 3) , ACCC sought leave to argue that there should be a severance of the respective parts of the Pt A competition notice pursuant to s 46 of the AI Act so as to preserve the validity of those parts which had been notified in the notice of invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Her Honour held (at [83]---[91]) that there could not be a severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She held that s 46 had no application to a decision made under an Act as distinct from an instrument (at [55]) and also distinguished between questions of severance involving an "excess of power" and a lack of power to make an entire instrument (at [57]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">29 It suffices to say that s 151AKA(10) was a prohibition on the issuing of a Pt A competition notice unless ACCC had first taken the steps mandated by s 151AKA(10)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">30 The statutory provisions in the present case are different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Section 152CR(1) required ACCC to take specified matters into account in making a decision, namely, a final determination, and s 152AQA required ACCC to have regard to any determination of principles relating to the price of access to a declared service if it was required to arbitrate (make a decision upon) an access dispute under Div 8 in relation to that service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">31 These positive requirements are not implied prohibitions against the making of any decision on the access dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In the absence of a special provision like that found in s 152DNA(7), the requirements apply generally to the making of a final determination as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">As noted earlier, I do not accept that the legislature intended that an entire final determination should always fall to the ground just because ACCC failed to comply with its statutory obligations in respect to any discrete part of it: cf Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">32 Excision of cl 5A(i) does not cause the remainder of the Final Determination to operate in an unintended manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The remainder of the Final Determination is perfectly capable of operating as intended in respect of all periods except that from 15 November 2006 to 22 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Telstra's second argument: appropriate orders could not be made to give effect to a decision by the Court that the final determinations are severable, because under Pt XIC of the Act it is not open to the ACCC to re-exercise the power under s 152CP while a (severed) final determination is in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
33 At the outset, Telstra draws attention to orders which would typically be made on a successful application for judicial review where there was no issue of severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In such a case, the order would ordinarily be that the whole of a final determination be set aside and the access dispute be remitted to ACCC for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In such a case, ACCC's duty under s 152CP(1) would remain unexercised and the access dispute that had been notified under s 152CM would remain pending and unresolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">ACCC would therefore remain under the duty imposed by s 152CP(1) to make a written determination on access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">34 Telstra argues that if there is to be a severance in the present case, orders would be made under s 16(1)(a) of the ADJR Act setting aside cl 5A(i) and under s 16(1)(b) referring the access dispute to ACCC for further consideration according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">35 Telstra submits, however, that the statutory framework demonstrates that such orders would be inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">36 Telstra submits that if part of a final determination is left standing and valid, the access dispute that had been notified to ACCC pursuant to s 152CM would not remain pending, because that particular access dispute would have been determined under s 152CP by the final determination that was the subject of the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">According to Telstra, the severed surviving part of the final determination can be valid only if it is itself a final determination within s 152CP(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">37 According to Telstra's submissions, ACCC would have to make a second determination under s 152CP(1) and (2), yet, according to Telstra, this would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Telstra supports its submission as follows:
 3.19 The language of s 152CP(1) contemplates that an access dispute is determined by the making of only one final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The only other grounds on which an arbitration may be terminated are set out in s 152CS(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Pursuant to s 152CP(1), the ACCC's duty is "to make a written determination on access by the access seeker to the declared service [emphasis added] and pursuant to s 152CP(2) "the determination" [emphasis added] may deal with any matter relating to access by the access seeker to the declared service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The power to make a final determination depends upon the existence of a pending notification made under s 152CM which initiates the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">If that notification is withdrawn, the ACCC has no power to make a final determination or an interim determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">(Act s 152CN(3)) Where a final determination has already been made, there can also be no remaining power to make a further final determination in relation to matters not the subject of the first final determination, since the notification is no longer pending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The arbitration which it initiated was terminated on the making of the first final determination, which remains valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">3.20 The legislative intention is that the power under s 152CP be exercised by making only one final determination, not two, nor a series of final determinations dealing with various matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">If that were possible, the ACCC could make a final determination of matters which were the basis for notification of the dispute and later make a second final determination dealing with matters which were not the basis for notification of the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">This could also occur in the reverse order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Section 152CP does not contain any time limitation as to the making of a final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The process of making subsequent final determinations would be unlimited as to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The arbitration would not be terminated by the first final determination and the access dispute could be never-ending with no certainty as to when it would ultimately be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">3.21 However the legislative intention evident in s 152CP(1) is that a single final determination is made and that this single final determination "terminates" the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">3.22 The correctness of this construction is reinforced by other provisions in Pt XIC of the Act, dealing with interim determinations, and variation of interim determinations and final determinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">3.23 Section 152CPA(1) provides that a determination may be expressed as an interim determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Unless sooner revoked, (Act s 152CPA(5)) an interim determination remains in force for the period specified in it, which must be a period of not longer than 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">(Act s 152CPA(5)) It may be extended for only one further period of 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">(Act s 152CPA(5A)) The Act contemplates that there may be a series of determinations, but these are to be expressed as "interim determinations" and that the regime of interim determinations operates for no more than a total of 24 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">3.24 Section 152CPA(2) expressly provides that an interim determination does not terminate an arbitration or relieve the ACCC of its duty to make "a final determination" [emphasis added].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Sections 152CPA(2) and 152CP(1) indicate that the determination of a dispute is not to occur on a rolling basis with regard to various matters but rather is to be made in one decision which is a final determination made under s 152CP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">3.25 Any determination governing the dispute during the period prior to the determination of the dispute is made in accordance with different procedural requirements than those applying to the making of the final determination which terminates the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In particular, an interim determination may in certain circumstances be made or varied without the ACCC's observing the principles of procedural fairness, (Act s 152CPA(3),(12)) and the ACCC has a discretion but not a duty to take into account the matters set out in s 152CR(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">(Act s 152CR(3),(4)) 3.26 Provision is made in Part XIC for variation of interim determinations and of final determinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Pursuant to s 152CM(5)(b), an access dispute may be notified about whether a previous determination ought to be varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">This could be an interim determination or a final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Pursuant to s 152CPA(10)-(12) the ACCC may vary an interim determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Pursuant to s 152DT(1) the ACCC may vary a final determination on the application of any party to it, but cannot vary it if any other party objects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The note to s 152DT(1) states that if the parties cannot agree on a variation, a new access dispute can be notified under s 152CM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Further, the ACCC's power to make a variation under s 152DT is subject to the duty imposed by s 152CQ and 152CR as if it were the making of a final determination following notification of an access dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">(Act s 152DT(2)) 3.27 These provisions powerfully indicate that Part XIC contemplates that where an access dispute is terminated by a final determination, there is only one final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">If multiple final determinations could be made in relation to a particular notification of an access dispute, there would be no work for s 152DT to do in a case where, for example, the parties recognise after the event that a particular matter ought to be brought to the attention of the ACCC as a matter which ought to have been, but was not, covered by the final determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Once a final determination has been made in relation to a particular notification, any subsequent final determination in relation to that notification and arbitration must be made in accordance with the terms of s 152DT or be a separate final determination made after a new arbitration has been initiated by a notification made under s 152CM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">38 In response, ACCC draws attention to subss (1) and (3A) of s 33 of the AI Act, which provide:
 (1) Where an Act confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as occasion requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">(3A) Where an Act confers a power to make, grant or issue any instrument (including rules, regulations or by-laws) with respect to particular matters (however the matters are described), the power shall be construed as including a power to make, grant or issue such an instrument with respect to some only of those matters or with respect to a particular class or particular classes of those matters and to make different provision with respect to different matters or different classes of matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">ACCC submits that Pt XIC must be construed in conjunction with these provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">According to ACCC's submission, these provisions empower ACCC to make a final determination in parts, at different times, and in respect of different aspects of an access dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">39 ACCC submits, however, that if the Court should reject this submission, s 16(1)(a) and (b) (see [6] above) would permit the Court to set aside cl 5A(i) and to remit the entire access dispute to ACCC with a direction that it not further consider any other part of the access dispute dealt with in the other provisions of the Final Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">40 Request and Primus make the following submissions in response to Telstra's submission based on the framework of Pt XIC:
 
&#8226; Section 23 of the AI Act provides that, unless the contrary intention is expressed, words in the singular include the plural, and it follows that s 152CP of the Act allows ACCC to make more than one written determination on an access dispute that it is arbitrating;
 
&#8226; There is no reason in principle why there can not be more than one determination by ACCC, and there would have to be more than one if issues in dispute had been notified under s 152CM as separate access disputes;
 
&#8226; The Act itself recognises that a final determination may be found in separate written documents provided at different times (see s 152CLA(2), s 152 DT, s 152DC(1)(f)); 
 
&#8226; Cases in the criminal context in which a power to make an 'order' has been held not to permit severance of a conviction and fine on the one hand and forfeiture on the other, are distinguishable and far removed from the present context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">41 Notwithstanding the interesting submission made on behalf of Telstra, I do not think that its argument prevails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">42 Section 23 of the AI Act has the effect that in any Act, unless the contrary intention appears, words in the singular number include the plural.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I refer, too, to s 33(1) and (3A) of the AI Act set out at [38] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">43 In the light of these provisions, I do not see why, under s 152CP(1), it would not have been open to ACCC to make a written determination on all aspects of the present access disputes other than the question addressed in cl 5A(i), and then subsequently to make a written determination dealing with that aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I do not think it matters whether this be regarded as two written determinations or a single written determination expressed in two instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">44 While the power of deferral given by s 152CLA(2) applies only where ACCC receives an access undertaking and therefore would not have been available in the present case, the aspect of that provision that allows deferral of consideration of part of an access dispute demonstrates that it is not inherently inconsistent with Pt XIC that an access dispute be considered in parts and separate determinations made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">45 Similarly, the possibility of a series of access disputes being notified in respect of the various issues rather than a single access dispute in respect of those issues, points in the same direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">46 What is essential is that the Court be satisfied that there be severable issues and resolutions of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In the present case there was a discrete issue as to disconnection charges in respect of disconnections effected in the period 15 November 2006 to 22 August 2007, and that discrete issue was addressed entirely within cl 5A(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">47 I see no inconsistency with Pt XIC in my setting aside cl 5A(i) and remitting the subject matter of it for consideration and determination by ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">48 The result will be that the determination of 1 August 2007 will remain on foot resolving all other aspects of the access dispute, and that there will be a further determination to be made under s 152CP on the issue remitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">COSTS 
 
49 ACCC does not seek any order for costs in its favour and no other party seeks an order for costs against ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Accordingly it is appropriate that as between ACCC and the other parties, there be no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">50 Ground F (Disconnection Charges, Backdating and the "No Charge Period") was not applicable in the Chime proceeding (NSD 1560 of 2007): it was relied on only in the Request proceeding (NSD 1744 of 2007) and the Primus proceeding (NSD 1743 of 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It is common ground that the Chime proceeding should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However, in that proceeding also there are issues concerning costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">51 First, the application by Request, Primus and Chime (the second respondents) to reopen to adduce further evidence, which related to Ground A (Telstra's Cost Model) and Ground E (Disconnection Charges, Churn Process and "Option 2") was brought in all three proceedings, and I treat the motion as having, in substance, failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If the costs of that motion were to follow the event, the second respondents would be ordered to pay Telstra's costs of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">52 Second, the position concerning preparation of the Court Books was complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In the first place, four of the Court Books were Common Court Books, that is to say, they were common to all three proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The cost of preparing them should be apportioned, one-third to each of the three proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">53 Third, Telstra submits that the bulk of its costs in preparing the Court Books for all three proceedings would have been required in the Request and Primus proceedings even if Telstra had limited its case to the ground on which it succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I do not see, however, why this should affect the order to be made in the Chime proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">54 Fourth, originally there was an eleventh ground on which Telstra relied: see the earlier reasons at [7] and [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This was that the LSS Declaration was a legislative rather than an administrative act, and was invalid for failure to comply with certain provisions of the LI Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Following the hearing, however, the Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Act 2008 (Cth) was enacted, as a result of which the ground was not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Telstra submits that I should conclude that that ground would have succeeded and would have meant failure of all three proceedings, including the Chime proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I do not so conclude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Although the ground was on foot throughout the hearing and submissions were made in relation to it, I had not formed a view in relation to it by the time when it ceased to be pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">55 There were several interlocutory hearings concerning the effect of the Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Act 2008 (Cth) and as to the positions to be taken by the parties, in particular by Telstra, in relation to its effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The LI Act ground was referred to as Telstra's "nuclear point".</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The intention was to convey the idea that if successful this legal argument would have been fatal to the entire Final Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Although no evidence was directed to the issue, its importance was reflected in the fact that it attracted lengthy written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The second respondents are not entitled to recover costs associated with their resistance to Telstra's attack on this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">56 Telstra submits that it is artificial to distinguish between the Chime proceeding and the other two proceedings, and that it should be left to the three companies to make internal arrangements for the apportionment of liability as between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">However, counsel for Request, Primus and Chime points out that the three companies are independent of each other and that it cannot be assumed that agreement would be reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">On this basis, I think that I must make a separate order appropriate to each proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">57 Doing the best I can, I think that in the Chime proceeding, Telstra should be ordered to pay something in the range of 90 to 95% of Chime's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">I will make it the mid point of that range - 92.5%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The 7.5% allowance takes into account the work undertaken by Chime's legal representatives in relation to the ground not pressed and also Chime's failure on the motion to reopen and adduce further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Moreover, in referring to "Chime's costs" on which the 92.5% is to be calculated do not include two-thirds of the costs of Request, Primus and Chime on preparing the Common Court Books, because those two-thirds are to be treated as costs of Request and Primus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">58 I turn now to the Request and Primus proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">It will be clear, from what I have said above, that in relation to preparation of the Common Court Books, one-third is to be attributed to the Request proceeding and one-third to the Primus proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">59 The major issue raised in relation to costs in respect of the Request and Primus proceedings concerns Telstra's success on Ground F. Prima facie, Telstra should have its costs on that ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">60 The parties have made submissions directed showing the importance or unimportance of Ground F. In view of the severability of cl 5A(i) and the limited period (15 November 2006 to 22 August 2007) to which it was relevant and the undisputed fact that Telstra did not in fact make disconnection charges in respect of disconnections occurring during that period, or that if it did so, it did so to a very minor extent, I think that as a commercial matter, Telstra's success on Ground F does not loom large in the scheme of things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">61 Two particular submissions should be noted before I state my conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">62 Telstra submits that a sizeable amount of the transcript reveals a cross-examination of Telstra's witnesses that serves no useful purpose, and that the second respondents should not get their costs of that cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I do not accept the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I noted at [387] of the earlier reasons one concession made by a Telstra witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">More importantly, however, in the course of a very hard fought litigious contest of the present kind, one should not be too ready to penalise a party for an extensive cross-examination even if it does not contribute to the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">63 The second respondents submit that Telstra should be ordered to pay indemnity costs in respect of the period since the making of my orders of 7 October 2008 because Telstra did not negotiate in good faith towards reaching agreement on the orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The submission was not elaborated upon in oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I am not satisfied that the submission is supported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">64 Doing the best I can, I think that Telstra should be ordered to pay something in the range of 80 to 85% of Request's costs and 82.5% of Primus's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In each case, I will make it the mid point of that range --- 82.5%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Again, when I refer to "Request's costs" and "Primus's costs", I include in each case only one-third of the costs of preparation of the Common Court Books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">CONCLUSION 
 
65 For the above reasons, there will be orders as set out in the orders pages attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
