1 In these proceedings the applicant ('Ms Obieta'), a former student at TAFE Sydney Institute, Ultimo ('TAFE') claims relief in respect of conduct allegedly committed by her teachers, fellow students, TAFE and the Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Board ('VETAB').</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Ms Obieta claims that such conduct was unlawful as it constituted breaches of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ('the RDA'), the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ('the SDA') and against Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('the HREOC Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">2 TAFE is an organisation within the NSW Department of Education ('the Department').</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">VETAB is a body corporate which was constituted by the now superseded Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Act 1990 (NSW) (see now: Vocational Education and Training Act 2005 (NSW)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I SUMMARY OF FACTS 
 
3 In 2003---2004 Ms Obieta was enrolled at the TAFE Sydney Institute, Ultimo undertaking a two year part time course known as the Diploma of Business-Legal Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Although no cause for complaint arose in 2003, during May of 2004 Ms Obieta made allegations with respect to the conduct of her course, and against Mr David Norman, her teacher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Such complaints were made only after Ms Obieta received a grading of credit in her examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">She claimed that she was entitled to a mark entitling her to the grade of distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Her allegations against other teachers arose in consequence of their refusal to accede to her demands for higher marks to qualify her for a distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Her complaints against TAFE, VETAB and the Department were made following her dissatisfaction with the rejection by them of the complaints against her teachers and the administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">4 On 24 May 2004 Ms Obieta had raised matters of complaint concerning the alleged conduct of Mr Norman with the Head Teacher, Business Administration and Technology, Ms Nereda Catherine Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Those issues concerned not only the alleged conduct of Mr Norman in the classroom but also raised a complaint alleging discrimination based upon Ms Obieta's assertion that she was deliberately awarded poor results for her examination work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">5 On 7 June 2004 Ms Illingworth interviewed Ms Obieta in the presence of Ms Ellen Margaret Lawson, Head Teacher of Business Administration, and Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Ms Obieta claims that at this meeting Ms Lawson prevented her from speaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Ms Obieta complained that she had not been awarded correct marks for her examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">She also claimed that Mr Norman discriminated against her in class as detailed in the issues discussed hereunder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">6 Ms Illingworth requested that Mr Norman provide an apology in respect of statements made in a class discussion which Ms Obieta claims were discriminatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">During this meeting, and in an attempt to resolve their differences, Mr Norman agreed to provide an apology for any misunderstanding arising out of the class discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">However whether the apology was to be given to the class, or to Ms Obieta, is a matter in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">An apology was provided, as detailed in the issues, which Ms Obieta claims did not accord with the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">7 Ms Illingworth also arranged for Ms Obieta's examination paper to be reassessed by Mr William Stewart, a teacher in the Business Administration and Technology teaching section of TAFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">On 29 July 2004 another meeting was held convened by Ms Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Present at that meeting was Ms Obieta, Ms Illingworth, Ms Lawson and Mr Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Ms Clifton, another Head Teacher, arrived later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">By the date of this meeting, Mr Stewart had re-marked Ms Obieta's examination paper, as well as the examination papers of all other students in Ms Obieta's class, except one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Mr Stewart increased the marks of Ms Obieta by 2%, which made no difference to her grade of 'credit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Ms Obieta demanded a distinction, but Mr Stewart explained that he was unable to justify the award of the additional marks necessary for Ms Obieta to achieve such grade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">8 During that meeting Ms Obieta complained that Ms Illingworth, Ms Lawson and Mr Stewart had racially and sexually discriminated against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Ms Obieta also claimed that Mr Stewart was not a qualified assessor to re-mark her paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">9 Ms Obieta then complained to Ms Terri Connellan, Assistant Director, Educational Programs of TAFE concerning the conduct of Mr Norman, Ms Illingworth, Ms Lawson and Mr Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">As Ms Conellan was absent on leave at that time, Mr Peter Hassett, Chief Education Officer of TAFE reviewed Ms Obieta's complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">10 In relation to the reassessment of Ms Obieta's assignment, Mr Hassett satisfied himself that TAFE's Review of Results Policy had been followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 11 August 2004 he informed Ms Obieta that following his investigation he believed that the review process was carried out in an equitable manner and that the amendments suggested by Mr Stewart to the original marks granted should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">On 26 August 2004 Ms Obieta responded complaining that Mr Norman continued to be unpleasant and intimidating towards her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">11 Ms Connellan had tried unsuccessfully to contact Ms Obieta on 2 and 3 September 2004 requesting Ms Obieta to contact her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In the absence of any reply Ms Connellan wrote to Ms Obieta on 8 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Such letter requested that Ms Obieta telephone Ms Connellan's assistant to arrange a suitable time to meet with a view to resolving her issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">No response was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">On 20 September 2004 Ms Connellan contacted VETAB to advise that she could take no further action because of the absence of communication from Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">12 Thereafter Ms Obieta wrote to Margaret Anne Willis, Director of Quality Assurance Services of the NSW Department of Education and Training, complaining of her treatment by Ms Connellan and reiterating the complaints against her teachers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Having reviewed the complaints of Ms Obieta and the conduct by the Officers of TAFE in the review of the complaint, Ms Willis wrote to Ms Obieta on 4 February 2005 stating that VETAB had conducted an investigation of her complaint and was satisfied with the way in which TAFE had managed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">13 Ms Obieta thereafter referred the conduct of Mr Norman, TAFE and VETAB to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ('the Commission').</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">14 Ms Obieta instituted these proceedings nominating the Commission as the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">However, Ms Obieta later instituted separate proceedings against the Commission (see Lina Obieta v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2006] FCA 1684) and the Court ordered that the Commission be removed as first respondent to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">15 The fifth and sixth respondents were fellow students of Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Ms Obieta has alleged that they engaged in conduct which was unlawful pursuant to the SDA, RDA and the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">16 A section entitled 'Specific Issues' considered hereunder contains details of the 48 issues raised by Ms Obieta of alleged discrimination, harassment and victimisation under the RDA and SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It follows the same order as contained in the Statement of the Precise Matters raised against each respondent contained in Ms Obieta's submissions filed on 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Such document was prepared in response to the Court's direction that Ms Obieta provide a list of precise matters upon which she relied and the sections of the relevant legislation which she claimed were breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">17 Some of the alleged breaches refer to definition or explanatory sections, which cannot give rise to a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Accordingly the Court will make no reference to the alleged breaches of such sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Further, no cause of action can arise from an alleged breach of an International Convention as claimed by Ms Obieta (see Tasmanian Wilderness Society Inc and Others v Fraser and Others [1982] HCA 37 ; (1982) 153 CLR 270 at 274 per Mason J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Accordingly the Court will similarly not refer to articles of International Conventions which Ms Obieta claims have been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">II SPECIFIC ISSUES 
 COMPLAINTS AGAINST MR NORMAN 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">'Blue eyed --- Brown eyed' incident 
 
18 Mr Norman was Ms Obieta's teacher of the modules Interaction in a Legal Office , Interaction with Other Parties and Advocacy Skills , each of which were part of the TAFE course for the Diploma of Business-Legal Studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">19 On Wednesday 5 May 2004 during a class exercise relating to discrimination, Mr Norman proposed that the class be divided into different groups and that each group would be required to report, either ' for' a particular argument or ' against ' it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">He made a comment to the effect ' my two blue-eyed good friends over here would report that there is discrimination and the other group would report there is no discrimination '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Ms Obieta says that Mr Norman indicated that one who would be advocating that there was no discrimination came from the Philippines, thereby indicating Ms Obieta, and the other had a history of China, thereby indicating Ms Chong, another student in the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Ms Obieta claims that by reason of Mr Norman saying such words loudly and repeatedly on two occasions, she felt discriminated against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">She alleges that such conduct breached ss 9 and 18C of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">20 Mr Norman states that as part of the Advocacy Skills module he decided that a short class debate would be appropriate to give the class confidence in public speaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Following a discussion amongst the class members it was agreed that 'discrimination in Australia' was an appropriate topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">He requested Ms Obieta and Ms Chong to debate that there was no discrimination and addressed two other students and asked them to prepare the opposite argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Mr Norman has deposed that the four students selected were chosen solely because they were sitting closest to him in the front row of the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He acknowledges that Ms Obieta requested that she debate that there was discrimination but as he considered she would benefit from arguing the opposite case to improve her advocacy skills, he said to Ms Obieta words to the following effect:
 
 'Being a good advocate often means having to work outside your comfort zone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">As such I would like you to debate there is no discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">' 

21 Mr Norman says he referred to the ' Blue-eyed --- Brown-eyed Forum ' which had recently been broadcast on television and asked the class whether they had seen such program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He said to the class words to the effect:
 
 'Did anybody see this show?</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It was a fascinating example of how discrimination can be highlighted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">' 

22 Mr Norman says that before the debate commenced he said to Ms Obieta and Ms Chong:
 
 'I don't know if you have ever been discriminated against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">I would hope not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Nevertheless I think it is important that you use tonight's exercise to debate that there is no discrimination in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">As an advocate you will find that you will be confronted with situations where you don't agree with the position or views of your client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">That's part of being an advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">You have to follow the client's instructions.</sentence>

23 Mr Norman says it was at that stage that he invited the four students to commence their debate and states that he said:

<sentence id="s201">Refugee allegation 
 
33 Ms Obieta claims that on one occasion in class Mr Norman said words to the effect, ' who is a refugee here ', ' Lina did you come here by boat ' and after Ms Obieta's reply that she was not a refugee but an immigrant Mr Norman said ' I do not know the difference between an immigrant and a refugee '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Ms Obieta claims that these comments of Mr Norman's involved a distinction, exclusion or reference based on race, colour, descent or ethnic origin to offend, humiliate, insult and intimidate Ms Obieta in front of the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Such conduct is claimed to be a breach of ss 9 and 18C of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">34 Mr Norman denies that the discussion took place in the terms stated by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He recalls that during the discussion Ms Obieta volunteered that she was a refugee and then after further class discussions she aggressively denied that she was a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Mr Norman denies that he said to Ms Obieta ' Lina, did you come here by boat ', and he denies that anything that was said in this discussion was designed to discriminate, offend, humiliate, intimidate or insult Ms Obieta.</sentence>

36 On 19 May 2004, a class discussion was held concerning a recent program televised on Australian Story relating to an Afghan detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Mr Norman asked the class to consider the general needs of detainees.</sentence>

<sentence id="s223">Ms Obieta claims that she felt sexually harassed and humiliated on that ground and therefore Ms Obieta claims that his conduct breached s 28F of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">38 Mr Norman denies that a conversation took place in the manner described by Ms Obieta and denies particularly that he said the words attributed to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He says that the class discussion commenced to consider the issues an advocate would need to consider if they were representing a detainee.</sentence>

<sentence id="s227">It was in the context of discussing health issues that the question of sexual relations and birth control arose.</sentence>

<sentence id="s229">Mr Norman responded, ' What do you mean?</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">' Ms Davis responded, ' You know, entertainment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">'
 
39 Mr Norman understood Ms Davis reference to ' entertainment' to be a reference to sexual relationships and he accordingly said ' Do you mean sexual health issues?</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' He says he made such statement because he wished to maintain the class focus on issues that would need to be considered by an advocate acting for a detainee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The class discussion then moved on to consider the issues of sexual health and birth control and how an advocate for a detainee would need to give consideration to such matters if they arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">He particularly recalls the issue of birth control because the class discussion moved on to consider the possible impact of HIV and Hepatitis on a person in detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">40 Ms Davis acknowledges that following a discussion considering the needs of a detainee she raised in a sarcastic manner the entertainment needs and acknowledged that she meant the sexual health needs of a detainee.</sentence>

<sentence id="s237">Reference to shoes of Imelda Marcos 
 
41 Ms Obieta alleges that Mr Norman said to her during class discussions, ' Lina, isn't it Imelda Marcos that comes from the Philippines where you come from ' and ' how are the 3000 shoes of Imelda Marcos?</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">' 
 
42 Ms Obieta claims that Mr Norman made these comments regarding Imelda Marcos and her shoes drawing a distinction based on race or ethnic background that were offensive, humiliating, insulting and designed to incite contempt towards Ms Obieta from other members of the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Ms Obieta claims that conduct breached ss 9, 17 and 18C of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">43 Mr Norman denies that he said the words attributed to him.</sentence>

<sentence id="s251">She claims that the names of other students were called out, but not hers and as such claims that this is a breach of ss 9 and 13 of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">49 Mr Norman says that when he marks the class roll he only calls out the names of students who he cannot readily see or recognise when looking around the classroom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">As Ms Obieta invariably sat at the same seat at the front of the classroom she was always visible and it was not necessary for him to call her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">50 Ms Davis recalls Mr Norman stating in class that it was necessary for him to keep the class roll as part of his duty of care to ensure that if a student was injured there was a record of those present in class and of those who had left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In answer to a question by a student who wished to know why Mr Norman was diligent in keeping the class roll, he responded that he was aware that if students were receiving Austudy, they were required to attend 80% of classes and that the record was keep for that purpose also.</sentence>

<sentence id="s274">' Mr Norman says he responded in a calm manner and he denied that he got ' very angry ' or that he ' yelled ' at Ms Obieta as she claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Nor did he angrily question her why she had asked the question as she alleges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He denies there was any dispute with Ms Obieta as alleged.</sentence>

<sentence id="s284">You were raped over and over again for a very long period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">' Ms Obieta claims that such remarks were repeated many times and were yelled by Mr Norman whilst he was in a rage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">She claims that his behaviour was sexual verbal behaviour appertaining or imputed generally to women and that therefore she was sexually harassed by Mr Norman in breach of ss 28F and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">60 Mr Norman denies he said the words attributed to him on that occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">61 Ms Davis recalls the incident and says that she never heard such words being said by Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Victimisation 
 
62 Ms Obieta claims that Mr Norman victimised her during her period of study with TAFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Following her complaint to Ms Illingworth concerning Mr Norman's conduct, Mr Norman continued to provide her with less favourable treatment and interfered with her work and learning conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">She claimed that he would dictate fast and mumble with the effect that she had to stop taking notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">She claimed that he was picking on her all the time and was frequently calling her attention in class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">She claims Mr Norman sexually harassed, intimidated and humiliated her and demeaned her dignity as a woman on 25 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">He intentionally repeated his unfair marking of her class test and showed less favourable treatment to her than other students in the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">He did not mark her class test of 17 November 2004 fairly which gave her a lower grade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">He impaired her enjoyment or her right to enjoy, in a non-discriminatory learning and work environment which made her work or study environment unpleasant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">63 Ms Obieta claims that Mr Norman's discriminatory conduct was unnecessary to the performance of his professional duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Accordingly she claims that Mr Norman's conduct breached s 9 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">64 Mr Norman denies any such discriminatory conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">65 Ms Fogarty testified that she never saw Mr Norman become aggressive towards Ms Obieta and said that he was always polite and answered questions from any student including Ms Obieta in a polite and helpful manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Writing on the board 
 
66 Ms Obieta claims that Mr Norman requested her to write her assignment, being a letter to a client, on the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">She says that she told Mr Norman that the letter was too long to write on the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">She alleges that Mr Norman then asked her to stand up in front of the class next to him to read the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">She says she refused and told Mr Norman that he could use the projector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Mr Norman declined to do so and then informed her that she could read the letter from her seat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">67 Ms Obieta claims that he did not ask other students to write on the blackboard or to stand up in front of the class next to him to read their work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Accordingly, as she was the only one who was asked to do this task she was discriminated against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Ms Obieta accordingly claims a breach of s 9 of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">68 Mr Norman does not recall the particular incident in question and believes that he would not have asked Ms Obieta to write her letter on the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Rather, he would have asked the students to note on the board in point form the essential parts of a report or letter they had prepared so that the information could form the basis of a class discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Mr Norman says his teaching technique was to ask a number of students to read out work they had prepared so that the class was provided with a variety of information from which the class discussion could then occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">69 Ms Davis said that Mr Norman asked other students to write on the board when necessary and that he often asked students to come forward and make a presentation, especially in advocacy classes.</sentence>

<sentence id="s316">Costs agreement 
 
71 Ms Obieta alleges that Mr Norman provided her with wrong information relating to the need for a costs agreement in a victim's compensation matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Ms Obieta says that she argued with Mr Norman and told him that since a motor vehicle accident claim for personal injuries requires a costs agreement, the same should apply to a victim's compensation claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">She says that Mrs Elfert verified that the information provided by Mr Norman was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">She says that the information was intentionally misleading and accordingly breached of ss 9, 13 and 27 of the RDA and s 21 and s 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">72 Mr Norman responds that he explained to Ms Obieta that since solicitor's fees for a victim are paid by the Victim's Compensation Tribunal rather than through a costs agreement with the client, it was not necessary to have a costs agreement with the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">He says he also explained to her that if it was a personal injury matter, such as a motor vehicle accident or worker's compensation matter, a costs agreement should be forwarded to the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">73 Mr Norman denies Ms Obieta's allegation that there was any argument and says that at all times he remained calm in attempting to explain to Ms Obieta that it was not necessary that a costs agreement be prepared for a client in a victim's compensation matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Date of course ending 
 
74 Ms Obieta claims that Mr Norman asked the class when classes finished for the year and Ms Obieta answered that it would be ' up to the first week of December '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The other Australian students said that the last exam would be in December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Mr Norman thanked the Australian students, but not Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Ms Obieta claims he repeated the ' thank you ' and said ' I appreciate that very much ' on three occasions to the other students.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Ms Obieta claims that he thereby showed favouritism to the Australian students and that such conduct was a breach of s 9 of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">75 Mr Norman says that in class on 22 September 2004 he did not have with him his timetable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">As he wanted to know how much class time was left to cover the remaining materials in the course, he asked the class whether anyone knew when the course finished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Ms Obieta replied that the course finished in December in the previous year and accordingly the course would finish in December this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Ms de Souza responded that the last exam was in December but the classes actually finished in November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">He recalls that there was some disagreement between Ms Obieta and Ms de Souza but as it was disrupting the class he said that he would check the timetable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">76 Ms Davis recalls that Mr Norman asked the class whether anyone remembered when the teaching semester finished and the exams commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">She recalls Ms Obieta responding that because the class finished in December in the previous year, it would finish in December of that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Ms Davis then recalls Ms de Souza then said that the last exam was in December in the previous year and that the class would finish in November.</sentence>

<sentence id="s340">He referred to Ms Roxanna Ramos as ' Roxan' in his greeting to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">He called upon Ms Cecilia Cordova to recite a passage and referred to her as ' Lina' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Ms Obieta claims that when Mr Norman apologised for calling Ms Cordova 'Lina', this created hostility from other students in the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">She claims that Mr Norman's less favourable treatment of her had the effect of violating or impairing her rights on an equal footing with other students and made her feel ridiculed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">As such she claims that she was subjected to harassment or bullying which is at law, ' being subject to any other detriment '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Such conduct is alleged to be a breach of ss 9, 17 and 27 of the RDA and s 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">78 Mr Norman says that he inadvertently referred to Ms Cordova as Lina, realised his mistake and apologised to Ms Cordova.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">He states that it was not an attempt by him to incite other students to feel contempt for Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Approach of Mr Norman to Ms Obieta 
 
79 Ms Obieta states that during the class discussion on 8 September 2004, Mr Norman came closer to her, looked at her and said in a nasty way:
 
 'Oh, I don't want to be representing a client who assaulted somebody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">' 

80 She states that all the students looked at her and laughed and that Mr Norman created a hostile environment which was harassment or bullying and therefore she was ' subject to any other detriment '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Such conduct is alleged to be in breach of ss 9, 17 and 27 of the RDA and s 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">81 Mr Norman is not certain what the alleged incident relates to and does not recall it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">He maintains that he was always civil and polite when he was responding to questions from Ms Obieta, as well as questions from any other student, and that he did not address Ms Obieta at any time in a 'nasty' manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Credit/distinction 
 
82 Ms Obieta claims that on 10 November 2004 Mr Norman created a hostile and intimidating environment and deliberately created problems for her with other students because he repeatedly stated that she received a 'distinction' in her case study whereas the other students got a 'credit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">She states that the other students became angry and argued and wanted to know why Mr Norman marked the case study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">She claims that previously Mr Norman had indicated that the case study would not be marked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">As a result Ms Obieta claims that she was harassed and bullied and that the conduct of Mr Norman breached ss 9, 17 and 27 of the RDA and s 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">83 Mr Norman states that when the students were asked to do their assignments he informed them that it would be a percentage graded assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">He states that on 3 November 2004 when the students submitted their assignments there was uncertainty in his mind whether the advice he had provided concerning the grading was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">He advised the students of his uncertainty on 3 November 2004 and told them that he would seek clarification from Ms Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">He duly obtained the advice and spoke to the class on 10 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">He informed them that he had been told that it had been necessary for that piece of work to be given a percentage grading and he had graded the assignments accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">He advised the class that two students had received distinctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">One such student was Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">84 Mr Norman acknowledged that there was some disquiet in the class on 10 November 2004 but says that questions were directed at him and were concerned with the previous conflicting advice he had provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">He states that the disquiet was not the fact that Ms Obieta had been awarded a distinction and he refutes that he was attempting to incite the class to feel contempt towards Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">85 Ms Davis recalls that when an assignment was returned there was some confusion concerning the grading of the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">19.</sentence>

86 On 25 November 2004, Mr Norman returned the students' class tests in the Legal Costing module.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Ms Obieta testifies that Mr Norman did not come to her desk to return the papers but stood at the printer and threw her papers at her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">She found Mr Norman's behaviour offensive and rude, and intimidating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Further, Mr Norman omitted to mark two questions in her class test with the result that she received a lower grade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">She was the only student who complained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">She says she had an argument with Mr Norman and felt that Mr Norman was victimising her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">She claims that his treatment of her was discriminatory and breached ss 9, 13, 27 of the RDA and s 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">87 Mr Norman responds that the class being taken on that day was being conducted by Mrs Elfert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">He attended at the commencement of the class to return the class tests to the students.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">He denies that he 'threw' Ms Obieta's class test at her and says that he handed it back to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">After it was handed back, Ms Obieta approached him and began questioning him in relation to the grading.</sentence>

<sentence id="s510">Ms Obieta says it was also agreed that Mr Norman would apologise to her in front of the class but that Mr Norman only apologised to the class and not to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Accordingly, Ms Obieta claims that Ms Illingworth failed to comply with the agreement to have her test reviewed independently and to have her papers marked by an independent assessor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">122 Ms Obieta claims that she was therefore discriminated against by Ms Illingworth in breach of ss 9 and 13 of the RDA and s 21 of the SDA.</sentence>

<sentence id="s520">Ms Illingworth responded that she had not done so because Mr Norman, a part-time teacher, had not been at TAFE since she last spoke with Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">On the afternoon of 26 May 2004 Ms Illingworth and Mr Norman had a conversation in which Mr Norman was asked to re-mark the exam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">126 On Monday 31 May 2004 Ms Illingworth received a letter of complaint from Ms Obieta concerning Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Ms Illingworth informed Ms Obieta that no examination papers would be returned until Mr Norman was instructed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The only complaint made by Ms Obieta in the letter was in relation to her marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Upon receiving such letter Ms Illingworth telephoned Ms Obieta to tell her that such letter did not make any complaints of the kind she had referred to during her brief conversation with Ms Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">127 A meeting was then arranged for Ms Obieta, Ms Illingworth and Mr Norman on 7 June 2004.</sentence>

<sentence id="s531">Ms Illingworth says that she agreed to arrange for an independent assessor who was one of the day teachers, to review the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Because Ms Obieta then alleged bias, Ms Illingworth informed her that the class tests of all the students would be re-marked and compared to each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">129 With regard to the ' hostile people ' remark which was discussed, Mr Norman responded that he made reference to that issue in a light-hearted fashion to bring the class to order.</sentence>

<sentence id="s538">Ms Norman explained that he had raised the issue of ' sex and condom ' relevantly in class discussions on health issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">132 With regard to the 'Centrelink' issues, Ms Illingworth noted that there was no way of resolving the disagreement between Mr Norman and Ms Obieta and accordingly said that she would interview the class members concerning the issues raised by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">133 Ms Illingworth denies that it was agreed that Mr Norman would apologise personally to Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">She states that it was agreed that Mr Norman would apologise to the class for any offence or misunderstanding caused by the class discussion and Mr Norman indicated that he was prepared to do so.</sentence>

<sentence id="s543">135 Miss Illingworth then interviewed 21 students.</sentence>

<sentence id="s545">136 Ms Illingworth received Mr Stewart's results of the review and re-mark, which made minor adjustments to 7 of 25 student's results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">In Ms Obieta's case, the marks were marginally increased for the class examination from 67.5 to 69.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Such adjustment did not alter the grade awarded to Ms Obieta.</sentence>

<sentence id="s579">As a consequence she claims that Ms Illingworth's conduct involved an exclusion and preference which denied her access to benefits, and that she was discriminated against in breach of ss 9 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">147 Ms Obieta also claims that the first to fourth respondents failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop discrimination and victimisation and failed to implement its ' Staff and Student Policies '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">148 Mr Stewart has no recollection of such conversations.</sentence>

<sentence id="s584">Mr Stewart was not an assessor

<sentence id="s585">She says that she claimed that Mr Stewart was not an assessor and advised Ms Illingworth that the agreement for an assessment of her class test by an independent assessor had not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Ms Obieta also claims that she advised Ms Illingworth that the test was unfairly reassessed and re-marked by Mr Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">She claims that Ms Illingworth refused to provide her with a further reassessment and accordingly Ms Obieta claims that she was discriminated against in breach of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">150 Ms Illingworth states that Mr Stewart was a teacher in the daytime class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Mr Stewart testified that he holds qualifications issued by the Commonwealth Government which qualifies him as an assessor and teacher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Ms Illingworth maintains that there was no breach of the agreement as alleged, since Ms Obieta's class test was marked by Mr Stewart, who was independent.</sentence>

<sentence id="s598">Ms Obieta claims Ms Illingworth's conduct discriminated against her in breach of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>

<sentence id="s644">He believed that a formal request would need to have been sent by an applicant for information to the Freedom of Information Unit of the Department of Education and Training for response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">Mr Hassett acknowledges that his assumptions may have been incorrect but his action in declining to make the invitation available was not because of Ms Obieta's background, race or sex.</sentence>

<sentence id="s671">Vicarious liability of VETAB 
 
180 Ms Obieta says VETAB replied acknowledging receipt of her complaint and states that Ms Dawn Grayce, Senior Project Officer, informed her that organisations such as TAFE were required to comply with the Standards of the Australian Quality Training Framework and that VETAB was responsible for monitoring such compliance.</sentence>

<sentence id="s689">Failure to obtain diploma 
 
186 Ms Obieta claims that she received her Transcript of Record from TAFE in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">It established that she failed two modules, namely Litigation and Routine Legal Office Functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Such courses were conducted by Mrs Elfert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">187 Ms Obieta alleges that TAFE discriminated against her in breach of ss 9 and 13 of the RDA, and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA because she was not awarded the Diploma due to her fail results in the two subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">188 Ms Illingworth's affidavit sworn 13 September 2006 states that Category A exams of which Litigation and Routine Legal Office Functions were comprised, were marked by a marking panel which is separate from the teachers of the Business Administration and Technology at TAFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">The affidavit also states that once the papers have been marked they are forwarded directly to the Students Records Department at each college and therefore a teacher would not know the grading of a student from their class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">189 Mrs Elfert testified that although she was a member of the marking panel there are 'strict protocols' in place to prevent a person marking the papers of a student from that person's own college and that she did not have access to Ms Obieta's exam papers nor did she mark them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">COMPLAINT AGAINST DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND VETAB

<sentence id="s697">Failure to take appropriate action 
 
190 Ms Obieta says that VETAB advised her by letter dated 4 February 2005 that it was satisfied by the way in which TAFE had conducted the complaint against it and that the conduct of Mr Norman did not constitute discrimination towards any student.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">However VETAB did not respond regarding the results of the audit of the students' records in relation to discrepancies and failed to respond to the complaints regarding bullying and victimisation by the students.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">She says VETAB did nothing to resolve her complaints and failed to take any appropriate action.</sentence>

<sentence id="s704">She also claims that TAFE discriminated against her under the SDA arising out of the same conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">193 Ms Obieta claims that TAFE failed to take appropriate action to resolve all the discrimination that occurred during her period of study and failed her in the course which prevented her from obtaining her qualification.</sentence>

<sentence id="s708">45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">V ictimisation in relation to exclusion from supplementary exams 
 
195 Ms Obieta says she was not given any options or advice in relation to the two modules she failed and was never given the opportunity to sit for a supplementary exam until she lodged a complaint with the Commission for discrimination and victimisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">She said that she learnt of the availability of supplementary exams from the submission of Mr Phillip Carroll of TAFE which was provided to the Commission dated 10 October.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">Accordingly Ms Obieta claims that she was discriminated against in breach of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">196 The affidavits of Mrs Elfert and Ms Illingworth state that it is the responsibility of students to request supplementary examinations, the procedure for which is set out in the ' Revised Policy on Review of Results' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Ms Davis and Ms Fogarty stated in oral evidence that Ms Illingworth had told the students on a number of occasions that if they failed a Category A exam it was their responsibility to approach her as Head Teacher, to make arrangements to undertake revision exercises and supplementary exams.</sentence>

197 Ms Obieta says that on 17 March 2005 her solicitor, Ms Jill Yates of Hargreaves Practice, wrote to TAFE on her behalf concerning her complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">However TAFE did not offer the opportunity to do any supplementary exam and therefore discriminated against her in breach of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">198 The Department and TAFE refer to the affidavits of Mrs Elfert and Ms Illingworth which state that it is the responsibility of the student to arrange for supplementary exams after failing a Category A exam, as referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">199 Ms Davis testified that Ms Illingworth often told class members of the procedure to be followed if they failed Category A examinations, namely that they should approach her and ask her to make arrangements to do revision exercises and supplementary exams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">200 Ms Fogarty also testified that Ms Illingworth told the students of the process to be followed if they failed a Category A examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">Her evidence confirmed that of Ms Davis and of Ms Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">TAFE did not award Diploma 
 
201 Ms Obieta complains that TAFE discriminated against her and that she did not obtain her qualification because she was excluded from revision exercises and excluded from doing the supplementary examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">As such it is claimed that this constituted breaches of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">202 The Department and TAFE make the same response as in 46 above and deny the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">TAFE did not award Diploma and hindered career opportunities 
 
203 Ms Obieta claims that TAFE victimised her, has caused damage and affected her life, health and career opportunities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">She also claims to have lost her self esteem and confidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">Accordingly she was discriminated against by TAFE in breach of ss 9 , 13 and 27 of the RDA and ss 21 and 94 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">204 The Department and TAFE deny the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">III RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
205 The majority of the claims of Ms Obieta are made under specified provisions of the RDA and the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Ms Obieta claims that the conduct of the first, second and third respondents and that of several of their employees and also of Mr Norman, Ms Davis and Ms Fogarty and other students, variously constitutes racial discrimination pursuant to ss 9 , 10 , 13 , 18 and 18C of the RDA, intimidating and coercive behaviour in breach of s 27(2) of the RDA, inciting unlawful acts under s 17 of the RDA, and vicarious liability pursuant to ss 18A and 18E of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">Ms Obieta also makes allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment purportedly pursuant to ss 5 , 21 , 28A of the SDA, allegations of sexual harassment specifically in the context of educational institutions pursuant to s 28F of the SDA, allegations that the respondents have committed the offence of victimisation pursuant to s 94 of the SDA, allegations that the respondents have caused, instructed, induced, aided or permitted another person to do an act that would be unlawful under the SDA pursuant to s 105 of the SDA, and claims of vicarious liability pursuant to s 106 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">In addition, Ms Obieta claims that the respondents have breached provisions of the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (entered into force 2 January 1969) ('ICERD'), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (entered into force 23 March 1976) ('ICCPR'), the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (entered into force 27 August 1983) ('CEDAW') and the Convention Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation , (entered into force 15 June 1960) ('CDREO').</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">Racial Discrimination 
 
206 Section 9(1) of the RDA makes it unlawful for a person to do any act that constitutes racial discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">207 For Ms Obieta to establish that any of the conduct of which she complains amounts to racial discrimination under s 9(1) of the RDA she must establish the occurrence of an act involving 'a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin' which had the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing of Ms Obieta's human rights or fundamental freedoms: see s 9(1) of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">208 The elements that Ms Obieta must establish to prove race discrimination within the meaning of s 9(1) of the RDA are as follows: a person must do an 'act'; the act must involve either a 'distinction', 'exclusion', 'restriction' or 'preference' in the areas of 'social' or 'cultural' life or any 'field of public life'; the act must be based on race; the act must have either the purpose or the effect of impairing a human right; and the relevant 'human right' is identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">209 The expression 'act' is not defined in the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">The determination of whether there has been a 'distinction', 'exclusion', 'restriction' or 'preference' must be determined objectively based on an assessment of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">210 The requirement to identify that the particular 'distinction', 'exclusion', 'restriction' or 'preference' was ' based on' Ms Obieta's race has been the subject of judicial determination in Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another (1998) 91 FCR 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">At [33] the Court considered that the words 'based on' required a test of 'sufficient connection' with race rather than a 'causal nexus'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Weinberg J distinguished the expression 'based on' from other constructions used elsewhere in Federal anti-discrimination legislation (such as 'by reason of' or 'on the ground of').</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">The words 'based on' encompass a broader meaning of 'by reference to' and are not limited to 'by reason of' (at [30]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">What is required is a close relationship, between the designated characteristic and the impugned conduct, which is not necessarily causal (at [33]): see also Baird and Others v Queensland (No 1) (2005) 224 ALR 541 and Commonwealth v McEvoy and Another [1999] FCA 105 ; (1999) 94 FCR 341 for an analysis of the meaning of 'based on'.</sentence>

<sentence id="s748">The Full Court at [40] said: 
 
 ' It is for the applicant who complains of racial discrimination to make out his or her case on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">It may be accepted that it is unusual to find direct evidence of racial discrimination, and the outcome of a case will usually depend on what inferences it is proper to draw from the primary facts found: Glasgow City Council v Zafar [1997] UKHL 54 ; [1998] 2 All ER 953, 958.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">There may be cases in which the motivation may be subconscious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">There may be cases in which the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence is that, whether or not the employer realised it at the time or not, race was the reason it acted as it did: Nagarajan v London Regional Transport [1999] UKHL 36 ; [1999] 3 WLR 425, 433.</sentence>

213 Under s 9 it is also necessary to establish the relevant human right which has been impaired because of race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">The expression 'human right' for the purpose of the RDA incorporates the rights set out in the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) scheduled to the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">The preamble to the RDA recites the entry into force of the CERD and the desirability of parliament making provision for giving effect to the CERD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">Von Doussa J in Commonwealth v McEvoy and Another 94 FCR noted at [31] that:
 
 'It is apparent that in adopting the phrase "race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin" in s 9...Parliament has transported into the domestic law of Australia, through the RDA, text from Article 1.1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination' 

214 In addition it was noted in Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11 ; (1985) 159 CLR 70 that for the purposes of s 9 of the RDA 'human rights' may include those included in other international instruments to which Australia is a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">One such other instrument is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (as provided in Schedule 2 to the HREOC Act) which is relied upon by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">215 To succeed in establishing a claim under s 9(1A) of the RDA that there was an act involving a distinction based on, or done by reason of, her race, colour, decent or national or ethnic origin, Ms Obieta must establish that a term, condition or requirement that was not reasonable in the circumstances was imposed upon her (see s 9(1A)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">As was held by McHugh J in Waters and Others v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349 at 406 in reference to a similar provision in Victorian anti-discrimination legislation (see s 17(5)(a) Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (Vic)), such term, condition or requirement would need to be identified with precision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">216 Further, under s 9(1A)(b) Ms Obieta must established that she does not or cannot comply with the term, condition or requirement and under s 9(1A)(c), that the requirement has the purpose or effect of interfering with the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as Ms Obieta, of any relevant human right or fundamental freedom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">217 Section 10 of the RDA relevantly provides for a right of equality before the law and that the laws of the Commonwealth, States and Territories are to apply generally to all people regardless of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">Ms Obieta must show that under a particular law, she does not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or that she enjoys that right to a more limited extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Once this has been established then notwithstanding the particular law in question, by force of this section, she is entitled to enjoy the right to the same extent as persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">218 Section 13 of the RDA specifically deals with the provision of goods and services to the public and makes it unlawful for a person to refuse or fail to supply goods or services to another person or to do so on less favourable terms because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origins of that other person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">To establish a claim under this section, Ms Obieta must establish that by reason of her race, colour or national or ethnic origin or that of any of her relatives or associates, the supply of goods or services was refused to her or that there was a failure on her demand to supply such goods or services (s 13(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">Such claim could be established if such goods or services were supplied to Ms Obieta on terms or conditions less favourable than such goods and services would otherwise be supplied by reason of Ms Obieta's race, colour or national or ethnic origin or that of her relatives or associates (s 13(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">219 Section 18 of the RDA is a deeming provision which provides that if an act is done for two or more reasons and one of the reasons is because of the race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin of a person, then for the purposes of Part II of the RDA, the act is taken to have been done for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">Under s 18(b) there is no requirement that the reason for the act being the race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin of the person be the dominant reason or a substantial reason for doing the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">220 Section 18A of the RDA provides that employers or principals are vicariously liable for the acts of their employees or agents in circumstances that if the act was done by the employer or principal it would be unlawful under Part II of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Section 18A(2) provides that vicarious liability does not apply to an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">For Ms Obieta to establish a claim under this section she must establish that there was an act; that the act was done by an employee or agent of a person; that the act was done in connection with his or her duties as an employee or agent (s 18A(1)(a)); and that the act would be unlawful under Part II of the RDA if it were done by that person (s 18A(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">221 Section 18C of the RDA makes it unlawful for a person to do any act (otherwise than in private) if the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people (see s 18C(1)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Pursuant to s 18C(1)(b), the act must have been done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or all of the people in the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">Thus the first inquiry of s 18C is whether the act in question, can in the circumstances be regarded as reasonably likely to offend or humiliate a person in Ms Obieta's position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">222 In Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Another [2004] FCAFC 16 ; (2004) 135 FCR 105, French J observed at, [69] that the words ' offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate ' are to be considered according to ' their ordinary meaning, in their context, acknowledging their somewhat elastic content and having regard to the objectives of the legislation...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">These objectives, it was noted, are to be gleaned not only from the words of the legislation but also from extraneous material such as, inter alia, the Second Reading Speech of the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 (Cth) ('Second Reading Speech').</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">The Second Reading Speech provides that the Act was intended to ' close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour ': see Bropho 135 FCR at [70].</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">In Creek v Cairns Post Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1007 ; (2001) 112 FCR 352 at 356-357 Kiefel J said that the conduct which is encompassed by s 18C of the RDA is that which has, ' profound and serious effects not to be likened to mere slights '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">223 Section 18C of the RDA requires the satisfaction of an objective test of the likelihood that the act complained of will have the prohibited effect: see Hagan v Trustees of the Toowoomba Sports Ground Trust [2000] FCA 1615 at [15] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">The objective nature of the test was also considered in Bropho 135 FCR where French J at [66] citing the Second Reading Speech said: 
 
 'Community standards of behaviour rather than the subjective views of the complainant are taken into account' (Australia, House of Representatives Debates (1994), p334).</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">

224 A similar observation of the requirement of objectivity was made by Brown FM in Kelly-Country v Beers and Another [2004] FMCA 336 ; (2004) 207 ALR 421 at [84] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">225 The question of causation that arises in the application of s 18C(1)(a) has been considered in numerous cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">In Purvis v New South Wales (Department of Education and Training) and Another [2003] HCA 62 ; (2003) 202 ALR 133 at 138 the High Court explained per Gleeson CJ, at 171-2 per McHugh and Kirby JJ, at 187 per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, that the accepted test for causation in the context of anti-discrimination legislation focuses on the 'genuine basis' or 'the true basis' or 'real reason' for the act of the alleged discriminator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">The question of causation was also considered in Bropho 135 FCR at [71] wherein French J referred to the description by Kiefel J in Creek v Cairns Post 112 FCR at [28] of the key causation issue as 'whether anything suggests race as a factor' in the act in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">Kiefel J at [23] adopted the approach to the construction of statutory provisions similar to s 9 of the RDA taken by McHugh J in Waters 173 CLR at 401.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">226 In the latter case McHugh J said referring to s 17(1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (Vic):
 
 'The words "on the grounds of" and "by reason of" require a causal connexion between the act of the discriminator which treats a person less favourably and the status ... of the person the subject of that act ("the victim").</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">The status ... of the victim must be at least one of the factors which moved the discriminator to act as she or he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">' 

227 In Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515 at [31] Carr J agreed with the adoption by Kiefel J of the approach taken by McHugh J in Waters 173 CLR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">At 31 Carr J said: 
 
 'The authorities on the issue of causation in the context of the discrimination legislation were reviewed by Kiefel J in Cairns Post at [19]-[27].</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">It seems clear from what her Honour said at [22] that she regarded the assessment of a reason as being an objective one, but not one which excluded any evidence of the relevant person's intention or motive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">Regard was to be had to all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">I respectfully agree with that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">' 

228 Section 18E of the RDA is essentially similar to the vicarious liability provision in s 18A of the RDA except insofar as s 18E provides for the vicarious liability of employers or principals for acts of their employees or agents rendered unlawful pursuant to the provisions of Part IIA of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">For Ms Obieta to establish claims under this provision she would have to satisfy the same elements as for s 18A of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">229 Section 27(2) of the RDA provides for offences relating to the administration of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">To establish her claims pursuant to this section Ms Obieta must demonstrate that the particular respondent acted in a way to intimidate or coerce, or impose any pecuniary or other penalty on Ms Obieta 'by reason that' Ms Obieta had made or proposed to make a complaint of unlawful discrimination, or had furnished or proposed to furnish information to the Commission, or proposed to attend a conference held under the RDA or the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">In Microsoft Corporation and Another v Marks (No 1) 1996 69 FCR 117 Beaumont J noted at 137 that a proceeding should be classified as civil or criminal when it is commenced, and where the substance and object of the proceedings are remedial the proceeding should be classified as civil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">230 Despite the fact that one of the options of the Court in s 27(2) of the RDA is the imposition of a penal sentence, it has been held that the civil standard should nevertheless apply where the substance of the proceedings are civil (see In Marriage of Lindsey (1995) 128 FLR 46).</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">The majority of the High Court in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd and Others [1992] HCA 66 ; (1992) 110 ALR 449 has emphasised the fact that the ordinary standard of proof in civil litigation is proof on the balance of probabilities even when the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud (see Rejfek and Another v McElroy and Another [1965] HCA 46 ; (1965) 112 CLR 517 at 519-21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">It was also held in that case that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">231 Under s 17(a) of the RDA it is unlawful for a person to incite the doing of acts made unlawful by a provision of Part II of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Further s 17(b) makes it unlawful for a person to assist or promote the doing of such an act (whether by financial assistance or otherwise).</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">In Shaikh v Campbell &amp; Nivona Pty Ltd [1998] HREOCA 13 (24 April 1998), in referring to s 17 of the RDA, Commissioner Innes AM stated at 8:

<sentence id="s809">Incitement denotes encouragement in an active way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">' 

232 To establish her claims pursuant to this section, Ms Obieta must show that the particular respondents were actively inciting or encouraging behaviour that is made unlawful by a provision of Part II of the RDA (s 17(a)) or that the respondents assisted or promoted the doing of such acts (s 17(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">Sexual Discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation 
 
233 Section 5 of the SDA provides a definition of sex discrimination under the SDA and does not of itself give rise to a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">It essentially provides the conditions that are required before a person called the 'discriminator' (s 5(1)) can be found to have discriminated against another person called the 'aggrieved person' (s 5(1)) on the grounds of the sex of the aggrieved person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Under s 5(1) if by reason of the sex of the aggrieved person, or a characteristic that generally pertains to or is generally imputed to a person of that sex, the discriminator treats the aggrieved person less favourably than the discriminator treats or would treat a person of the opposite sex, then the discriminator has discriminated against the aggrieved person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Ms Obieta must establish that the respondent in question treated her less favourably than the respondent would treat a person of the opposite sex in circumstances that are the same or not materially different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">234 Section 21(2) of the SDA renders it unlawful for an education authority to discriminate against a student on the grounds, inter alia, of the student's sex relevantly by denying or limiting the student's access to any benefit provided by the educational authority (s 21(2)(a)); or by subjecting the student to any other detriment ( s 21(2)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">235 For Ms Obieta to establish a claim under s 21(2)(a) of the SDA she must prove that the respondents discriminated against her on the ground of her sex pursuant to the definition in s 5 of the SDA, either by denying or limiting her access to any benefits provided by the educational authority (s 21(2)(a)) or by subjecting her to any other detriment (s 21(2)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">236 In Sivananthan v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Service [2001] NSWADT 44 , a case which considered, inter alia, the meaning of 'detriment' in comparable state legislation, the Administrative Decisions Tribunal ('ADT') found that the word 'detriment' should be given its common meaning of 'loss, damage or injury' (at [40]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">It was also said in that case that '[t]he detriment suffered... must be real and not trivial' and 'whether something constitutes a detriment must be determined objectively and not subjectively' (at [41]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">In Damiano and Another v Wilkinson and Another [2004] FMCA 891 at [23] Baumann FM considered the meaning of detriment gleaned from three authorities as follows: 
 
 '...

237 Similar to s 5 of the SDA, s 28A of the SDA is a definitional section and does not of itself give rise to a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">It provides the definition of sexual harassment and in order for Ms Obieta to establish that any of the conduct alleged constitutes sexual harassment she must establish that a person made an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours to her (s 28A(1)(a)) or that a person engaged in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature directed at her (s 28A(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">This section prescribes an objective test as it is a requirement that the impugned conduct occurred:
 
 'in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that... [Ms Obieta] ... would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</sentence>

238 Section 28A(2) defines 'conduct of a sexual nature' as including 'making a statement of a sexual nature to a person, or in the presence of a person, whether the statement is made orally or in writing' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">Where it is alleged that conduct is unlawful under the SDA, the context of the conduct must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">In Cooke v Plauen Holdings [2001] FMCA 91 , Driver FM observed that whether an act or statement can constitute sexual harassment will depend upon the nature or the quality of the act or statement.</sentence>

<sentence id="s827">240 Pursuant to s 94(1) of the SDA it is an offence for a person to commit an act of victimisation against another person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">Pursuant to s 94(2) Ms Obieta is required to establish that the relevant respondent subjected, or threatened to subject her to any detriment on the grounds that Ms Obieta had or was believed to have made or proposed to make a complaint under the SDA or under the HREOC Act (s 94(2)(a)); or that Ms Obieta had brought or proposed to bring proceedings under the SDA or the HREOC Act against any person (s 94(2)(b)); or that Ms Obieta had furnished or produced or proposed to furnish or produce any information or documents to anybody exercising functions under the SDA or the HREOC Act (s 94(2)(c)); or that Ms Obieta had attended or proposed to attend a conference held under the SDA or the HREOC Act (s 94(2)(d)); or that Ms Obieta appeared or proposed to appear as a witness in proceedings under the SDA or the HREOC Act (s 94(2)(e)); or that Ms Obeita has reasonably asserted or proposed to assert any rights under the SDA or the HREOC Act (s 94(2)(f)); or that Ms Obieta had made an allegation that a person had done an act that is unlawful under Part II of the SDA (s 94(2)(g)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">In Damiano [2004] FMCA 891 Baumann FM at [22] said, referring to Bailey v ANU (1995) EOC 92-744, that for victimisation to be established under comparable legislation one of the grounds under a section comparable to s 94(2) of the SDA must be a 'substantial and operative' factor for the alleged action.</sentence>

243 Ms Kim Hua Chong provided two affidavits in support of Ms Obieta's allegations dated 16 June 2006 and 16 September 2006 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">Ms Chong told the Court that the affidavits were prepared by herself with the assistance of her cousin who is a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">Many passages were identical, both in the words used and in the punctuation, to the passages relating to the same incidents and recitation contained in Ms Obieta's affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">This was apparent in numerous instances in both her affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">244 On 18 October 2006 Ms Chong swore that she did not consult with Ms Obieta, and did not see Ms Obieta's affidavits before she prepared her own affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">She swore that the content of her affidavit was from her own memory, and that her cousin assisted her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">She denied that her cousin had a copy of Ms Obieta's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">245 Ms Chong also swore that despite the fact that she was only asked to provide her affidavits close to the time they were sworn, that she nevertheless was able to recollect in detail events and conversations which occurred almost 18 months previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">Ms Chong reiterated that she had not collaborated with Ms Obieta and that the content of the affidavits was from her own recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">246 At the request of counsel for the first to fourth respondents, the Court provided a warning relating to perjury and the Court adjourned.</sentence>

<sentence id="s864">However, it was impossible to know whether such recollection resulted from the text of the affidavits which Ms Obieta prepared for her, or from independent recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">For this reason, and taking into consideration the fact that she had provided no independent evidence of substance, the Court places no weight on her testimony or affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">250 Ms Chong withdrew as a witness after Ms Obieta acknowledged that she did not wish to persevere with her testimony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">251 It is disturbing that Ms Obieta was prepared to permit testimony to be given to the Court by Ms Chong which she knew was false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">Ms Obieta told the Court that Ms Chong's cousin who is a lawyer helped her prepare Ms Chong's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">Such statement was untrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">252 Further disturbing conduct occurred when Ms Obieta made statements from the Bar table which were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">Such statements related to the preparation of Ms Chong's affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">253 The transcript records the following:
 
 'Do you agree that what you told the Court from the bar table was not true?---Well, some part of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">
 
 What part of it was not true?---The typing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">The typing --- the typing of the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">
 
 You told the Court that your computer was slow, and therefore Ms Chong typed up the affidavits?---Yes, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">
 
 That is what you told the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">Is that true or false?---It is false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">' 

254 The first to fourth respondents submit:
 
 'It is clear that the applicant had been caught out providing false information to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">When confronted with this reality the applicant made what can only be described as a disingenuous and nonsensical attempt to draw a distinction between lying from the bar table and lying on oath: T 351.21-.29, (19/10/06).</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">' 

The Court accepts that but for the ultimate honesty of Ms Chong, Ms Obieta would have deliberately deceived the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">255 Ms Obieta has further alleged that the TAFE records have been falsified and in particular that the record of Ms Ramos had been altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">She alleged also that Ms Illingworth swore a false affidavit and that she believed that the Crown Solicitor of NSW was complicit in such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">Ms Obieta also alleges that TAFE had tampered with a letter forwarded by Ms Obieta's previous solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">Even when that solicitor produced a computer generated copy, identical to that which was sent to TAFE except for the absence of the letterhead, Ms Obieta maintained that there were discrepancies in the content of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">256 Having made observations during oral evidence, and having considered their testimony, I find that the respondent's witnesses, the teachers of Ms Obieta, and staff of TAFE namely Mr Norman, Mrs Elfert, Ms Illingworth, Ms Lawson, Ms Willis and Mr Stewart were dedicated educators whose evidence I accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">I have also formed the view that Ms Connellan, Mr Hassett, Ms Davis and Ms Fogarty were all truthful witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">257 Surprisingly, Ms Obieta did not suggest to any of the witnesses that the conduct she relied upon as establishing discrimination was based upon her race, sex, nor that such actions arose in consequence of a proposal by her to make a complaint to the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">258 The Court finds that where evidence conflicts between that of Ms Obieta and other witnesses, the Court must consider these findings of credit in determining whether the burden of proof has been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">V FINDINGS 
 
259 Three important considerations arise from the above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">Firstly, the burden of proof lies upon Ms Obieta to establish discrimination, harassment or victimisation whether it arises pursuant to the RDA or the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">Secondly, with respect to claims of unlawful discrimination, harassment or victimisation under the RDA, it is essential that the discrimination, harassment or victimisation be proved, on the balance of probabilities, on the ground of Ms Obieta's race (see Victoria v Macedonian Teachers' Association of Victoria Inc and Another [1999] FCA 1287 ; (1999) 91 FCR 47).</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Similarly, with regard to a claim for sexual discrimination, harassment or victimisation under the SDA, discrimination, harassment or victimisation based upon Ms Obieta's sex must be established on the balance of probabilities: see Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc v South Australia and Another (No1) (1995) 64 SASR 551 at 553.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">260 The findings of the Court in relation to each of Ms Obieta's allegations are set out below and must be read in conjunction with the section entitled Relevant Legal Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">COMPLAINTS AGAINST MR NORMAN 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">'Blue eyed --- Brown eyed' incident 
 
261 The Court accepts the evidence of Mr Norman that the statement relied upon by Ms Obieta occurred during a class exercise and was made in the context of a recent television program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">It is not established that the words ' the other one comes from the Philippines and the other one has a history of China ' were ever said by Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">262 Taking into account the context of the discussion, the Court is satisfied that the selection of Ms Obieta to take part in the debate did not involve a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based upon race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">Accordingly, no breach of s 9 of the RDA is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">Further the statement was not reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate, nor was it done because of Ms Obieta race, colour, or national or ethnic origin and so does not establish a breach of s 18C of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">Award of low marks 
 
263 Ms Obieta has not discharged the onus of proof in establishing that there was any bias or lack of objectivity on the part of Mr Norman in the grading of tests, assignments and reports prepared by her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">In any event, such conduct would not establish a breach of ss 9(1) and 13 of the RDA as the onus of establishing that there was a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which was based on Ms Obieta's race or that she was refused supply of goods and services because of her race is not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">Reference to hostile people 
 
264 The Court accepts Mr Norman's evidence concerning the making of such statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">Even if such statements had been said, they would not amount to a breach of ss 9 and 13 of the RDA as there is no evidence that such statement was based on Ms Obieta's race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">Refugee allegation 
 
265 The Court is not satisfied that the onus of proof has been satisfied to establish that such words were said as alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">Further, even if such words were said, the context would not render them words which would constitute a breach of ss 9(1) and 18C of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">Such words, even if said could not have affected the enjoyment or exercise of a human right as required by s 9(1) of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">Further there is no evidence to establish that in the context in which any such words were said, they would be reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">Afghani Detainee 
 
266 The Court accepts that there was a discussion in class concerning the needs of a hypothetical Afghani detainee and the needs of such detainee, however the Court is not satisfied that the words allegedly said by Mr Norman were in fact said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">Further, contrary to the Court's finding, even if such words had been used by Mr Norman, such conduct would not amount to a breach of s 28F because the requirement of the definition of 'sexual harassment' contained in s 28A would not have been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">The circumstances were not such that a reasonable person would anticipate that Ms Obieta would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">Reference to shoes of Imelda Marcos 
 
267 The Court accepts the evidence of Ms Fogarty that such words were said by another student.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">Accordingly the Court finds that Mr Norman did not say the words alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">Centrelink allegation 
 
268 The Court accepts Mr Norman's evidence that he did not know which, if any, students were supported by Centrelink and that the term ' Mutual Obligation Scheme' was not known to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">The Court therefore finds the allegation not proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">Further, if, contrary to the Court's finding such words had been said, there is no evidence that they were racially based and accordingly there is no evidence of any breach of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Roll call allegation 
 
269 The Court accepts Mr Norman's evidence that he called out the names of the students who he could not readily see or recognise and that since Ms Obieta was well known to him and was always visible sitting in the front row, it was unnecessary for him to call out her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">The Court finds that the evidence does not establish a basis for a claim of racial discrimination and there is accordingly no breach of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">Failure to mark fairly 
 
270 The Court does not accept that Ms Obieta was marked unfairly in her class test and assignment by Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">The Court finds that there is no evidence of any unfairness in the grading system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">Further, there is no evidence that any such conduct, even if proved, was motivated by race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Accordingly there was no breach of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">Fast dictation 
 
271 The Court finds that on occasions Mr Norman may have dictated quickly and when requested by students to slow down he would do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">The Court is also satisfied that if such occasion arose, it was unintentional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">The Court finds that there is no discrimination based upon race, nor is there any evidence that such conduct constituted sexual harassment of Ms Obieta as claimed as in the circumstances a reasonable person would not have anticipated that Ms Obieta would be offeneded, humiliated or intimidated by such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">Gay incident 
 
272 Mr Norman acknowledges that a question was asked by Ms Obieta and the Court finds that he responded as he states and that this was appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">The Court finds that there was no dispute as alleged by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">273 Even if, contrary to the Court's finding, Mr Norman responded as Ms Obieta alleges, there is no evidence that such conduct was racially based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">It follows that there was no breach of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">Allegations of sexual discrimination 
 
274 The Court is unable to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the words were used as alleged, nor that the incident Ms Obieta refers to occurred in the manner she claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">Further, even if, contrary to the Court's finding, such words were said, the context was that of a class discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">The Court is satisfied that such occasion does not give rise to sexual harassment within the meaning of s 28A of the SDA as a reasonable person would not anticipate that Ms Obieta would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">Further such conduct does not constitute an unwelcome sexual advance or request or other unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature and could not therefore constitute a breach of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Victimisation 
 
275 Ms Obieta appears to repeat allegations she has already made concerning the dictation of Mr Norman, with a variant that he mumbled when dictating as well as dictating fast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">She repeats an allegation of humiliation and that she received less favourable treatment than other students in her class test marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">276 The Court finds that the burden of proof in relation to any of the factual issues has not been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">Even if, contrary to the Court's finding, the factual matters, insofar as they have been already considered in the preceding paragraphs did occur, then there is no evidence that such conduct arose in consequence of Ms Obieta's race or sex or because Ms Obieta had made complaints against Mr Norman to Ms Illingworth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">Writing on blackboard/white board 
 
277 The Court finds that Ms Obieta may have been requested, during the class exercises, to write something on the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">However, there is nothing to suggest that the request of Mr Norman to do so in such circumstances was done in consequence of her race or constituted sexual harassment or discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">Costs agreement 
 
278 The Court accepts Mr Norman's evidence concerning his conversation relating to the need for a costs agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">In these circumstances there is no factual basis for the allegations made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">Even if the Court were in error in so concluding, upon the facts alleged, they would not give rise to any issue under the RDA because there is no suggestion that the statements of Mr Norman were related to Ms Obieta's race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">Further, there is no evidence that such conduct had any relationship to her sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">Accordingly, there is no basis for the claims made under the RDA and the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Date of course ending 
 
279 The Court finds that there was a discussion concerning the date of the last week of lessons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">However the conduct referred to does not establish any basis of racial or sexual discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">More favourable treatment for Ms Ramos 
 
280 The Court accepts that Mr Norman inadvertently referred to another student using Ms Obieta's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">Mr Norman acknowledges that this was an unintentional error and there was no intention to incite any feeling of contempt for Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">The Court accepts Mr Norman's explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">Further the Court finds that there is no evidence that such conduct arose because of any racial distinction or oppression, nor is there any evidence that it was based upon Ms Obieta's sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Accordingly the Court finds that there is no breach of either the RDA or the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Approach of Mr Norman to Ms Obieta 
 
281 The Court notes that Mr Norman does not recall the incident and the Court considers that, without corroboration, it could not be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that any such incident occurred as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Further, even if, contrary to the Court's finding, such incident occurred, there is nothing to suggest that it was made on the basis of Ms Obieta's race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">Accordingly the Court does not find any breaches of the RDA or the SDA as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">Credit/distinction 
 
282 The Court accepts that on 10 November 2004 there was some confusion in the class concerning the marks that had been allocated for a particular assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">However, the Court is satisfied that there is no basis for any alleged racial or sexual discrimination of Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Throwing of examination papers 
 
283 The burden of proof of the allegation that Mr Norman threw Ms Obieta's class test at her is not discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Further, the Court does not find from this incident any facts which suggest that the omission to mark the two exam questions arose in consequence of Ms Obieta's race or the sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">This was an unintentional oversight of Mr Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">Accordingly the Court finds no breach of the RDA and the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">Cheezels Incident 
 
284 The Court accepts that Mr Norman did not see the incident referred to and that the circumstances, even if proved, could not give rise to a breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">The Court is not satisfied that any such act would constitute a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race or that such conduct would constitute an unwelcome sexual advance, request or other unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature in circumstances in which a reasonable person in the circumstances would have anticipated that Ms Obieta would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">COMPLAINTS AGAINST MS ALEXIE DAVIS 
 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Wrong name called in class 
 
285 The Court is unable to accept that Ms Davis made the noises as Ms Obieta has not discharged the requisite burden of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Further, even if such incident did take place there is no evidence to suggest that it arose in consequence of Ms Obieta's race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">As such there is no breach of the RDA and SDA as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">The Cheezels incident 
 
286 The Court accepts that Ms Davis often ate Cheezels in class and to do this placed them on her fingers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">She stated, and the Court accepts, that from the position where she sat in class towards the back of the room, she would have to look in the direction of Ms Obieta to see the teacher who stood at the front.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">The Court accepts that she did not stare at Ms Obieta as claimed, and that there was no racial or sexual innuendo in her conduct as perceived by Ms Obieta which could constitute a breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">287 The Court is unable to find any conduct of a racial or sexual nature directed at Ms Obieta and rejects the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">Mimic of a duck or chicken 
 
288 The Court finds that the burden of proof has not been discharged in respect of this allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">Further, even if such incident was proven, there was nothing to suggest that it arose in consequence of Ms Obieta's race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">Verbal behaviour of Ms Davis 
 
289 The Court is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Ms Davis made the comment alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">It further finds that, even if such statement had been made, there was nothing to suggest that it was based upon Ms Obieta's race or sex as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">Allegations of tutoring 
 
290 The Court finds that Ms Davis did make the statement as acknowledged by Ms Davis to Mrs Elfert but that such statement was made to Mrs Elfert and not to Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">Further, the Court accepts the evidence of Ms Davis that such comment resulted from the exasperation of Ms Davis that so many questions were being asked requiring Mrs Elfert to provide extensive attention to Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">The Court accepts the explanation of Ms Davis that she felt that it was inappropriate for one student to receive so much attention when the course was unfinished and the end of the semester was rapidly approaching.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">291 The Court finds that the conduct complained of was not racially or sexually motivated as alleged and that no breach of the RDA or the SDA resulted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">Apprehension of bullying 
 
292 The Court finds that there was one occasion in a Saturday class when Ms Davis was giggling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">This occurred when the students were light-hearted and the Court finds that Ms Davis' giggling was not directed at Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">Further, the Court finds that there is no evidence that such conduct arose in consequence of Ms Obieta's race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">COMPLAINTS AGAINST MS RYISSA FOGARTY 
 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">Interference with the right to ask questions 
 
293 The Court finds that there was an occasion when Ms Fogarty asked Ms Obieta to consider the rights of the other class members to ask questions and that Ms Obieta responded to such suggestion in a hostile manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">However the Court finds that such request was unrelated to the race or sex of Ms Obieta and as such did not constitute a breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">COMPLAINTS AGAINST 'AUSTRALIAN STUDENTS' 
 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Allegations of victimisation by s tudents 
 
294 The Court finds that the allegation that students victimised and denied Ms Obieta access to learning is generalised and is not established on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">Further there is no evidence that any such conduct was racially or sexually motivated and thus does not constitute racial or sexual discrimination, harassment or victimisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">COMPLAINT AGAINST MRS ELFERT 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">Misleading information provided by Mrs Elfert 
 
295 The Court rejects the claims of Ms Obieta that Mrs Elfert failed to provide her with vital information and supplied her with the wrong or incorrect information relating to the assessment guidelines, notes, lessons and requirements concerning exams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">The Court is satisfied that Mrs Elfert provided all the necessary information for Ms Obieta and other students and that Ms Obieta either failed to comprehend or failed to follow information provided to all students at the commencement of and during the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">296 The Court also finds that Mrs Elfert told Ms Obieta to check the Study Guide when a question arose concerning the material which could be taken into the exam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">The Court also finds Mrs Elfert did not tell Ms Obieta that no materials could be taken into the exam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Further, even if Ms Obieta was not provided with accurate information, there is no evidence to suggest that this was based upon Ms Obieta's race or sex and as such does not constitute a breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">COMPLAINTS AGAINST MS NEREDA ILLINGWORTH 
 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">Failure to comply with agreement to have test independently reviewed and re-marked 
 
297 The Court finds that Ms Illingworth offered to have Ms Obieta's class test and assignments in the modules taught by Mr Norman re-marked by an independent assessor and that Mr Stewart was appointed to re-mark Ms Obieta's class tests and then subsequently her assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">298 The Court also finds that there was an agreement made on 7 June 2004 by Ms Illingworth that Mr Norman would apologise to the class, but not specifically to Ms Obieta, for any misunderstanding that may have arisen out of class discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">Such agreement was made solely in an attempt to placate Ms Obieta, without any acknowledgement by Mr Norman that his conduct in the class discussion was in any way improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">299 Further, the Court accepts Ms Illingworth's evidence concerning the conduct of Ms Obieta during the meeting on 7 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">The Court also accepts the evidence of Ms Illingworth concerning the conduct of Ms Obieta in a subsequent meeting on 29 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">300 The Court finds that there is no discrimination against Ms Obieta as claimed resulting from any conduct engaged in by Ms Illingworth and that there is no basis for any claim under the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">None of the conduct complained of by Ms Obieta, even if established, is claimed to have arisen in consequence of her race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">COMPLAINT AGAINST MR STEWART 
 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">Discrimination in provision of services 
 
301 The Court accepts the evidence of Mr Stewart that he explained to Ms Obieta at the meeting on 29 July 2004 the procedure he had used to mark the paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">The Court also accepts that Mr Stewart, in response to Ms Obieta's demand that her grades be increased from a credit to a distinction, explained to her that she did not gain sufficient marks required for such standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">302 The Court is satisfied that there is no conduct which could constitute a breach of the RDA or the SDA and that no discrimination of any kind was suffered by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">COMPLAINT AGAINST MS ILLINGWORTH 
 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">Grades of other students 
 
303 The Court finds that at the meeting held on 29 July 2004 Ms Obieta complained that another student received a higher grade than she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">However, the Court finds that there is no evidence of racial or sexual discrimination, harassment or victimisation and there is no breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">Mr Stewart was not an assessor 
 
304 The Court is satisfied that Mr Stewart was qualified as a teacher and assessor as evidenced by the certificate tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">He was qualified to undertake the re-mark of Ms Obieta's class tests and assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">The Court is also satisfied that he was independent of the staff who were engaged in the day-to-day tuition of Ms Obieta and that accordingly his assessment of Ms Obieta's marks was 'independent'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">305 The Court is satisfied there is no racial or sexual discrimination resulting from Mr Stewart's re-mark of Ms Obieta's paper and thus no breach of either the RDA or the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">Denial of access to interview records and grades 
 
306 The Court finds that Ms Illingworth was requested by Ms Obieta to provide information obtained in consequence of interviewing 21 students relating to Ms Obieta's complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">The Court also finds that Ms Obieta requested a copy of her class test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">The Court also finds that Ms Illingworth refused to provide both but does not find that Ms Obieta requested her class test pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">The Court finds that there is no evidence of discrimination in the conduct of Ms Illingworth in refusing to supply such records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">307 There is no basis to suggest that Ms Illingworth's refusal resulted from racial or sexual considerations relating to Ms Obieta and accordingly there was no breach of the RDA or the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">Request for the removal of the word 'Deferred' on test results 
 
308 The Court finds that Ms Illingworth included the word 'Deferred ' in Ms Obieta's test results because Ms Obieta had requested a review of the mark she had received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">The Court also finds that Ms Obieta was told that the deferred result would remain on her record until the issue concerning her marks was resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">309 The Court is unable to find any evidence of discrimination in such conduct of Ms Illingworth and further, that there is no basis for any allegation that such conduct was based on race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">No breach of the RDA or SDA is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">COMPLAINTS AGAINST MS CONNELLAN 
 35.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">Refusal by Ms Connellan to supply transcript of record 
 
310 The Court finds that Ms Connellan attempted to contact Ms Obieta on several occasions by telephone to discuss her request for the supply of her Transcript of Record, but that no return phone call was made by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">311 The Court finds that since it was not possible to communicate with Ms Obieta, Ms Connellan communicated with VETAB advising that no further action could be taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">312 In view of these proven facts, the Court is unable to find that there is any racial or sexual discrimination directed towards Ms Obieta in consequence of any conduct of Ms Connellan.</sentence>

313 The Court finds that a request was made by Ms Obieta under the Freedom of Information Act for the supply to her of her academic record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">Mr Hassett was not primarily responsible to handle such matters, but he did so during Ms Connellan's leave from 2 August to 27 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">The Court accepts Mr Hassett's evidence that he understood that an application for information under the Freedom of Information Act would need to be addressed to the Freedom of Information Unit of the Department of Education and Training for a response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">It was for this reason that he declined Ms Obieta's request for the supply of the Transcript of Record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">The Court accepts that Mr Hassett knew nothing of the background of Ms Obieta and did not discriminate against her on the ground of race or sex in declining to forward her Transcript of Record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">A distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based upon Ms Obieta's race is therefore not established and Ms Obieta was not treated less favourably than someone of the opposite sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">As such there no breach of the RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">COMPLAINT AGAINST TAFE 
 37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">Failure to act on complaints against Mr Norman 
 
314 Ms Obieta wrote to Mr Hassett on 26 August 2004 advising him of the discrimination against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">Mr Hassett took no action but the Court is satisfied that Mr Hassett, by not responding to her letter, did not discriminate against Ms Obieta on the grounds of race or sex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">The Court is also satisfied that the actions of TAFE in relation to Ms Obieta's requests for her class test, results of interviews and enquiries relating to the 'Deferred' result appearing on her Transcript of Record were not racially or sexually discriminatory and do not constitute breaches of RDA or SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">COMPLAINTS AGAINST VETAB 
 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">Failure to undertake audit of students' records 
 
315 The Court is satisfied that VETAB has no role in the assessment of complaints made against institutions at which education is provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">There is no basis for the alleged racial or sexual discrimination, as the reason that no audit of students' records was conducted as requested was because this was not part of the function of VETAB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">As such no breaches of the RDA or SDA are established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">Vicarious liability of VETAB 
 
316 The Court is not satisfied that the vicarious liability of VETAB is established pursuant to the SDA and RDA as there is no conduct of VETAB employees which constitutes unlawful discrimination or offensive behaviour either under s 18A or s 18E of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">VETAB not providing remedy to complaints 
 
317 The Court repeats the finding made in 38 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">Further the Court is satisfied that Ms Obieta failed to respond to VETAB's requests that Ms Obieta contact them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">COMPLAINT AGAINST MRS ELFERT 
 41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">Complaint to Ms Illingworth concerning Mrs Elfert's failure to provide information relating the to the examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">
 
318 As this claim is a duplication of that made in paragraph 28 above, the findings of the Court are those referrable to that complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">There can be no vicarious liability when no primary liability is established, and no racial or sexual discrimination is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">COMPLAINT AGAINST TAFE 
 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">Failure to obtain diploma 
 
319 The Court finds that no evidence has been provided in support of the allegations that the strict protocols required for the marking of Category A exams were not upheld by TAFE or that Ms Obieta's intention to make a complaint to the Commission was in any way related to the fact that Ms Obieta failed the modules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">Accordingly the allegations of discrimination and victimisation on the basis of race or sex have not been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND VETAB 
 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">Failure to take appropriate action 
 
320 In respect of Ms Obieta's complaint that VETAB did nothing to resolve her complaints and failed to take appropriate action, the Court finds that VETAB, although a separate statutory entity, comprises part of the Department of Education and that its role was to ensure that educational institutions registered with it had appropriate grievance procedures in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">It was not the role of VETAB to investigate the specific complaints of Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">In this respect the role of VETAB is misunderstood by her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">321 The evidence establishes that VETAB did ensure that appropriate procedures were in place and on the material before it was satisfied that those procedures had been implemented by TAFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">322 No discrimination on the ground of race or sex by VETAB against Ms Obieta is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">COMPLAINTS AGAINST TAFE 
 44.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">Failure to take appropriate action 
 
323 In respect to Ms Obieta's claim that she was treated less favourably than other students and that TAFE's conduct involved an exclusion, segregation or restriction and preference based on race, the Court is satisfied that there is no evidence to support such allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">Further, the Court is satisfied that there is no evidence to find that TAFE discriminated against Ms Obieta on sexual grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">324 In respect of Ms Obieta's claim that TAFE excluded her because she was not given revisionary exercises and a supplementary exam, the Court is satisfied from the evidence of Ms Illingworth and Mrs Elfert that the procedures were clearly established pursuant to which a student who is unsuccessful in an exam was entitled to sit for a further exam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">The evidence shows that Ms Obieta's friend, Ms Chong sat for such exams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">The Court is satisfied that Ms Obieta chose to dispute the marks given to her and to pursue her belief that she should have been awarded higher marks, in preference to accepting that her performance did not justify the grades to which she aspired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">The evidence of Ms Connellan establishes that her attempts to communicate with Ms Obieta in September 2004 were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">Had Ms Obieta elected to return the calls, the Court is satisfied that she would have received additional advice on the avenues available to her to sit for further exams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">Ms Obieta chose not to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">There is no basis for the assertion that TAFE discriminated against Ms Obieta on racial or sexual grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">Victimisation in relation to exclusion from supplementary exams 
 
325 The Court finds that Ms Obieta was given the opportunity to resit Category A exams; that information in relation to this procedure was provided in the 'Revised Policy on Review of Results'; and that it was the responsibility of students to organise such supplementary exams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">326 The Court is unable to find that TAFE discriminated or victimised against Ms Obieta on the grounds of her race or sex as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">No offer to sit supplementary exams 
 
327 Ms Obieta stated her position clearly in her letter to the Commission dated 22 November 2005 that she ' should not and I am not going to suffer the consequence of re-taking the exams '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">The Court finds that it was the responsibility of the individual student to request a further examination and the procedure for doing so was explained by Mrs Elfert on several occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">The Court therefore finds that there is no basis for the allegations of unlawful discrimination or victimisation made by Ms Obieta and there was no breach of the RDA or SDA as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">328 TAFE received the letter from Ms Julie Yates of the Hargreaves Practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">However a reply was forwarded and there was no further follow up to the enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">The Court finds no evidence that TAFE falsified the letter as claimed by Ms Obieta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">TAFE did not award diploma 
 
329 The Court is satisfied that Ms Obieta was given the opportunity to partake in revision exercises and sit for supplementary exams in relation to her failed Category A exams if she chose to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">However, Ms Obieta failed to avail herself of this opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">There is no evidence to establish the allegations of unlawful discrimination or victimisation due to Ms Obieta's race or sex in relation to the failed modules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">TAFE did not award diploma and hindered career opportunities 
 
330 Ms Obieta has not established that the conduct complained of amounted to unlawful discrimination on the basis of Ms Obieta's race or sex and the Court rejects the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">Vicarious Liability 
 
331 Ms Obieta complains that the Department of Education, VETAB and TAFE are vicariously liable for the conduct of their staff, namely Mr Norman, Ms Illingworth, Mrs Elfert, Mr Hassett and Ms Connellan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">Pursuant to s 18E of the RDA, TAFE, the Department of Education and VETAB can only be held to be liable if an employee or agent in connection with his or her duties as an employee engages in conduct which is unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">A provision to the same effect is contained in s 106 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">Since the Court has found that none of the conduct of the employees whose conduct has been complained of constitutes a breach of either the RDA or the SDA, there is no occasion to give rise to vicarious liability under either statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">CLOSING SUBMISSIONS 
 
332 At the conclusion of all of the oral evidence on 26 October 2006, Ms Obieta was asked whether there was anything further in her case which she wished to raise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">Ms Obieta told the Court that she did not wish to raise any further matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">333 The hearing was then adjourned to allow the parties to provide written submissions and the hearing resumed on 11 December 2006 for the purpose of hearing submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">334 In her written submissions Ms Obieta claimed that she was humiliated, insulted, intimidated and offended with the treatment she had received during the hearing of the matter in Court; that documents were 'struck off' by the Court during the hearing; and that she received unequal treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">Since the Court was still possessed of jurisdiction, it was concerned to know of the specific matters of which Ms Obieta claimed in order to remedy any alleged unfairness or irregularities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">Accordingly the Court asked Ms Obieta to identify the matters she claimed in support of her submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">335 Ms Obieta said two medical reports were 'struck off'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">In fact they were rejected because the reports were not verified and the makers were not available for cross examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">336 Ms Obieta also claimed that her class exercise described as her 'portfolio' had been rejected from tender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">The Court transcript records that she never sought to tender it on a prior occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">In response Ms Obieta claims that the transcript had been edited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">The Court granted leave to Ms Obieta to re-open the hearing to tender her portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">337 Ms Obieta also claimed that attendance records had been rejected by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">In fact they had already been marked as an exhibit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">She then complained that she was not allowed to photocopy documents that had been produced on subpoena.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">It was explained again to her that such order had been made during the hearing to preserve the confidentiality of other persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">Ms Obieta nevertheless had the opportunity to inspect all of the records produced on subpoena during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">338 Ms Obieta then claimed that she had been 'blocked to ask questions' and that she was forced to ask questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">The transcript does not record that she was ever forced to ask questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">She could not identify any questions which she was prevented from asking and the transcript does not support her submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">CONCLUSION 
 
339 Since Ms Obieta's claims have failed, the Court dismisses the application with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">I certify that the preceding three hundred and thirty-nine (339) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy .</sentence>
