 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 Mr Robert Brown served in the Australian Army between 1 October 1941 and 20 July 1943.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">From 21 July 1943 to 17 January 1946 he served in the Royal Australian Air Force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He is taken to have been rendering operational service during each of the above periods (s 6A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Veterans' Entitlements Act ')).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Mr Brown died on 29 June 2003 aged 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicant is his widow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">She claimed a war widow's pension asserting that her husband's death arose out of, or was attributable to, his war service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The bases of her assertions were that his habit of smoking was war-caused and that his smoking contributed to his death through ischaemic heart disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Mr Brown's death certificate records in the space provided for 'Cause of Death and Duration of last illness' :
 
 '(I) (a) Cardiorespiratory exhaustion, 1 week 
 
 
 
 (b) Progressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 9 months 
 
 
 
 
 (II) Sepsis (chest/urinary), 1 week'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">
 
 
 

4 Mrs Brown seeks an order from the Court setting aside a decision of the Veterans' Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( Brown v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 348) which affirmed decisions of the Repatriation Commission and the Veterans' Review Board rejecting her claim for a war widow's pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Each of those decisions was based on a finding that Mr Brown's death was due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 For the reasons set out below I have concluded that Mrs Brown is not entitled to the relief that she seeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES 
 
6 Mrs Brown appealed to this Court from the decision of the Tribunal in reliance on s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That subsection authorises an appeal to the Court 'on a question of law' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">7 The limited nature of an appeal on a question of law has recently been considered by the Full Court in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321, Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 , HBF Health Fund Inc v Minister for Health and Ageing [2006] FCAFC 34 and Purvis v Dairy Adjustment Authority (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It is not necessary to repeat here everything said in those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is sufficient to observe that they make clear that the subject matter of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act is the question (or questions) of law stated in the notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Court has no jurisdiction on such an appeal to evaluate the evidence before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Order 53 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules (and see also Form 55A) requires the notice of appeal to state separately the question or questions of law to be raised on the appeal, the order sought and the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This final requirement calls for a brief statement explaining why the answer to the question (or questions) of law will lead to the making of the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 At the first directions hearing I drew the attention of Mrs Brown's counsel to the fact that there were recent Full Court authorities touching on appeals under s 44(1) of the AAT Act and referred him to the Etheridge judgment in particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">There was an exchange between us concerning the proper formulation of a question of law, the requirements of O 53 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules and the alternative source of jurisdiction provided by s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Counsel disavowed any wish to rely on the ADJR Act but sought, and was granted, leave to file and serve an amended notice of appeal pursuant to s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 The amended notice of appeal purports to identify the following questions of law:
 
 
 '2.1 Whether the Tribunal, in determining that the death of the veteran within the meaning of "death" in sections 8 and 120 of the Act, and the only kind of death within the meaning of "kind of death" in section 120A of the Act, was from non-Hodgkins lymphoma, mistook the evidence given by Dr Edwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.2 Further or in the alternative to paragraph 2.1, whether, on the proper construction of "death" as that term appears in sections 8 and 120 of the Act and "kind of death" as that term appears in section 120A of the Act, and given purported reliance by the Tribunal upon the evidence given by Dr Edwards, the meaning of those terms necessitated the Tribunal finding that the "death" and/or "kind of death" of the veteran was or included death from pneumonia-related infection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.3 Whether the Tribunal afforded procedural fairness to the parties when it decided that the veteran had suffered a "kind of death" different from the "kind of death" put to it by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">' 
 
 
 

10 As counsel for the applicant conceded at hearing, question 2.1 is not a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">What was the understanding of the Tribunal on any issue is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is not appropriate for the Court on an appeal under s 44(1) to undertake a comparison of the Tribunal's understanding of a particular issue with the evidence adduced before it for the purpose of determining whether the Tribunal misunderstood the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Question 2.1 is therefore incapable of constituting the subject matter, or part of the subject matter, of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">11 Question 2.2 is not easy to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It appears to involve some questions of law; ie the proper construction of statutory expressions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">However, it also appears to call for an evaluation of the evidence given by Dr Edwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It is thus a mixed question of fact and law and, for this reason, not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the AAT Act (see Etheridge at [16]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Therefore, it is also incapable of constituting the subject matter, or part of the subject matter, of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 Question 2.3 is intended to raise for consideration whether the decision of the Tribunal should be set aside because the Tribunal:
 
 
 (a) was obliged to afford Mrs Brown procedural fairness; and
 (b) failed to do so in that it reached the conclusion that the kind of death suffered by Mr Brown was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when that conclusion was not urged on the Tribunal by either Mrs Brown or the Repatriation Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 

13 Sitting alone I am bound by the majority decision of the Full Court in Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 ; (2003) 131 FCR 28 that a complaint of denial of procedural fairness may be raised on an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">However, it seems to me, as I have previously sought respectfully to suggest, that the majority judgment in Clements wrongly equates an error of law with a question of law (see, for example, Birdseye at [18]; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at [46] ; Etheridge at [13]-[17])).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This is the view that was taken by Gyles J, the minority judge in Clements at [58]-[67].</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">See also Purvis esp at [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 At the hearing of the appeal, Mrs Brown sought leave to rely on a further amended notice of appeal which included a claim for relief pursuant to s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The proposed further amended notice of appeal did not seek to expand the subject matter of the proceeding; ie, Mrs Brown's complaints about the decision of the Tribunal remained unchanged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">No application was made for an extension of time within which to lodge an application for review under the ADJR Act (see O 54 r 2A of the Federal Court Rules ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">No attempt was made to frame the proposed amendments substantially in the form prescribed for an application under the ADJR Act (O 54 r 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">15 I reserved my ruling on the application for leave to further amend the amended notice of appeal until publication of these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Unless it can be established that the proposed amendment would strengthen Mrs Brown's claim for relief nothing would be gained by granting the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 I therefore turn to consider the merit of the complaints made by Mrs Brown about the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">DID THE TRIBUNAL MISUNDERSTAND DR EDWARDS' EVIDENCE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
17 Dr Edwards provided a written report on the circumstances surrounding Mr Brown's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In his report Dr Edwards expressed the opinion that Mr Brown's terminal illness was due to sepsis originating in his lungs and urinary tract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He stated that Mr Brown's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had reduced his ability to fight infection and the treatment for that illness similarly compromised his immune state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">18 In oral evidence before the Tribunal Dr Edwards said:
 
 'the final cause of death was the pneumonic process, the pneumonia, the infection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The underlying cause of death was the rapidly progressive malignant disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">' 
 

19 Dr Edwards also gave oral evidence that he did not think that ischaemic heart disease played a 'big part' in Mr Brown's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He observed:
 
 'In fact we had good evidence that his cardiologist was very happy with his cardiac state and that the malignant process supervened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">' 
 

20 In its written reasons for decision the Tribunal accurately recorded that it was Dr Edwards' opinion that Mr Brown died of overwhelming sepsis, that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had reduced Mr Brown's ability to fight infection and that treatment for that illness had similarly compromised his immune state (see [17]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal also noted that Dr Edwards' position could be summarised in terms of the evidence given by him which is identified in [18] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">21 The Tribunal summarised its understanding of Dr Edwards' evidence, and the conclusions to be derived therefrom, in the following passage from its reasons for decision:
 
 'As we understand Dr Edwards's evidence, the pneumonic infection was a complication of the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and its treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">This is not a case of multiple "kinds of death".</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Accordingly, we find that the kind of death suffered by Mr Brown was "non-Hodgkin's lymphoma".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This is in accord with the clinical decision of the palliative care team taken three days before Mr Brown died, that his condition was incurable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 

22 Mrs Brown, by her counsel, submitted that Dr Edwards' evidence was not to the effect that the sepsis was a complication of the lymphoma alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In support of this submission counsel drew attention to certain answers given by Dr Edwards in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">During his cross-examination Dr Edwards said that ischaemic heart disease was a significant underlying disease process that Mr Brown had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">He agreed that he might have included ischaemic heart disease in part 2 of a death certificate for Mr Brown; that is, in the section of the certificate which Dr Edwards described as appropriate for recording 'contributing factors, factors that might be in the background, present for many years' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">He contrasted factors of that kind with 'causes of death' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">23 Dr Edwards was not asked in cross-examination, or it seems at any time, to express an opinion on whether, because of his ischaemic heart disease, Mr Brown died from pneumonia earlier than would otherwise have been the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Nor was Dr Edwards asked to express an opinion on whether ischaemic heart disease otherwise accelerated Mr Brown's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In the absence of answers from Dr Edwards on these questions, it is to be inferred from the answer recorded in [19] above, that Dr Edwards did not think that ischaemic heart disease accelerated Mr Brown's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">24 The contention that the Tribunal misunderstood Dr Edwards' evidence is untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Dr Edwards' evidence was that the proximate or ultimate cause of Mr Brown's death was pneumonia caused by sepsis originating in his lungs and urinary tract; Mr Brown was unable to resist that proximate or ultimate cause because of his rapidly progressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Dr Edwards, for this reason, described non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as Mr Brown's underlying cause of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">While Dr Edwards accepted that Mr Brown suffered from ischaemic heart disease, nothing in his report or evidence provided support for a conclusion that Mr Brown's heart disease played a part in, or accelerated, his death from pneumonia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">25 Dr Edwards' evidence, as summarised above, is entirely consistent with the conclusion of the Tribunal that the Statement of Principles concerning Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (dated 12 August 2003) is a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(2) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in respect of the kind of death suffered by Mr Brown (see s 120A of that Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">That Statement of Principles defines 'death from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma' to include 'death from a terminal event or condition that was contributed to by the person's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma' (see Instrument No 37 of 2003).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">THE KIND OF DEATH MET BY MR BROWN 
 
26 The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (Cth) introduced s 120A into the Veterans' Entitlements Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Section 120A modifies the operation of s 120 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Subsections 120A(2) and (4) introduce into the Veterans' Entitlements Act the concept of a Statement of Principles in respect of a 'kind' of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">27 Subsection 120A(3) relevantly provides that, for the purposes of s 120(3) , a hypothesis connecting the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force a Statement of Principles that upholds the hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Section 120A(4) relevantly provides that subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a claim in respect of the death of a person if no Statement of Principles has been determined in respect of the kind of death met by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">28 The Court has not yet sought to provide definitive guidance on the meaning of 'kind of death' in s 120A --- although the concept has been considered in Repatriation Commission v Hancock (2003) 37 AAR 383 and Repatriation Commission v Towns (2003) 38 AAR 77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This is not an occasion for the provision of that definitive guidance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">29 Mrs Brown contended that the purported reliance by the Tribunal on the evidence of Dr Edwards necessitated the Tribunal finding that a kind of death met by Mr Brown was pneumonia-related infection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">This contention must, in my view, be rejected for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">30 The Tribunal was alive to the possibility that multiple medical conditions could have contributed to Mr Brown's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It observed in its reasons for decision:
 
 'There can be multiple medical conditions that contribute to a particular death in the sense of a medical cause that expedited the death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">If a medical condition contributed to the death and is relevantly related to service then that is sufficient to establish entitlement to pension (see Hancock [2003] FCA 711 at [8] - [9] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' 
 

31 However, the Tribunal concluded that the kind of death met by Mr Brown was the kind of death in respect of which a Statement of Principles had been determined, namely the Statement of Principles concerning Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma dated 12 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That Statement of Principles, as mentioned in [25] above, is relevant to a death from a terminal event which was contributed to by the person's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It defines 'terminal event' to mean the proximate or ultimate cause of death including pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, circulatory failure or cessation of brain function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">As discussed above, the Tribunal considered Mr Brown's pneumonia to have been a terminal event as that expression is defined in the Statement of Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">32 The above conclusion of the Tribunal has not been shown to have involved any error of law or otherwise to be amenable to review under s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Indeed I respectfully suggest that the Tribunal's decision was manifestly reasonable having regard to the evidence and other material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">33 In the circumstances it is not necessary for me to give consideration to whether a veteran may meet more than one kind of death, as opposed to a death to which a number of medical conditions contribute, for the purposes of s 120A(4) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">DENIAL OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS 
 
34 The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal discloses the following:
 
 (a) Dr Lynch, a tribunal member, put to Mrs Brown's representative --- 
 
 'The point [on which] this case will either rise or fall is the fact of whether pneumonia was the terminal event and the major cause of his death was his lymphoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">'; 
 
 
 (b) Dr Lynch subsequently put to Mrs Brown's representative --- 
 
 'if you put this man's cause of death down to pneumonia or pneumonic infection the whole statistics about cause of death would become a nonsense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It's really --- because this man has got bone marrow evidence of a lymphoma ... the major cause of his death in medical parlance would be his lymphoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">'; 
 
 
 (c) The respondent's representative submitted to the Tribunal --- 
 
 'If it is the opinion of this Tribunal that pneumonia is not a satisfactory kind of death and it's merely a terminal event then the question needs to be determined by this Tribunal what is the kind of death and I would suggest very strongly that a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a kind of death and that's perhaps not determinative in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The question is, is ischaemic heart disease a kind of death and that would be determined on the balance of probabilities and the respondent would say that it is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">' 
 
 
 (d) Mrs Kelly, the senior member of the Tribunal, put to Mrs Brown's representative --- 
 
 'What if we decide that the kind of death was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">' 
 
 And he replied ---
 
 'Well, it's a matter of how you do it I suppose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 

35 The suggestion that the Tribunal failed to afford Mrs Brown procedural fairness in respect of its decision that the kind of death met by Mr Brown was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is fully met by the above extracts from the hearing transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">An administrative tribunal such as the AAT is not obliged to accept a submission put to it jointly by the parties to a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The duty of the AAT is to make the correct or preferable decision in the circumstances ( Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 24 ALR 577).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">36 The above extracts from the Tribunal hearing reveal that the Tribunal let the parties know the approach that it proposed to take, and gave them an opportunity to be heard on whether it should find that the kind of death met by Mr Brown was pneumonia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The Tribunal could hardly have made it plainer that, if it concluded that pneumonia was simply a terminating event in Mr Brown's death, it was unlikely to find that he met a 'pneumonia kind of death'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The respondent's representative showed his appreciation of the approach foreshadowed by the Tribunal in the statement reproduced in [34(c)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">37 Mrs Brown was not denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal in the way alleged in paragraph 2.3 of the amended notice of appeal or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">CONCLUSION 
 
38 As I am satisfied that any application made by Mrs Brown for review of the decision of the Tribunal pursuant to the ADJR Act would fail, the appropriate course is to reject the application to further amend the amended notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">39 I therefore turn to the appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As mentioned above, neither paragraph 2.1 nor 2.2 of the amended notice of appeal identifies a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In any event, the complaints thereby made of the decision of the Tribunal are without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">As stated earlier, the question in paragraph 2.3 contains within it a false assumption, namely that the AAT is obliged to accept a submission advanced jointly by the parties to a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In any event, I am satisfied that Mrs Brown was not denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">40 The appeal from the decision of the Tribunal will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
