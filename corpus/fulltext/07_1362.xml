1 This proceeding has been settled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The parties have brought forward an agreed statement of facts and proposed consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The matter involves a breach of an undertaking given by the respondent on 22 October 2004 to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") for the purposes of s 87B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Had it not been for the undertaking the ACCC may have concluded that the purchase by the respondent, as one of a consortium of three buyers, of an interest in the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline should be rejected pursuant to s 50 of the Act by reason of its anti-competitive potential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Any breach of such an undertaking given to the ACCC is a matter that will be viewed with the utmost seriousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Because the bare terms of the orders proposed by the parties do not explain the basis upon which they have been sought, I intend to set out in its entirety the agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In essence, that statement of facts speaks for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is in the following terms: 
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 22 October 2004, Alinta 2000 Limited (formerly Alinta Limited) ( Alinta 2000 ) and a number of other companies gave an undertaking to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( Commission ) for the purposes of section 87B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( the Act ) ( Undertaking ), a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked A .</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Undertaking was given in connection with the purchase by Alinta 2000, as one of a consortium of three buyers, of an interest in the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline ( DBNGP ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Unless otherwise defined or indicated in this document, defined terms in this document have the same meaning given to them in the Undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The background to the giving of the Undertaking is set out in clause 2 of the Undertaking, which states as follows: 
 
 
 
 2.1 The Consortium proposes to acquire, through DBNGP Holdings and the Trust, the: 
 
 (a) shares in EEWAT (the current operator of the DBNGP); 
 
 (b) the shares in EEWAN; and 
 
 (c) the units in EEPT (the current owner of the DBNGP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">

 (a) the Consortium offered to give certain undertakings under section 87B of the Act to allay the concerns of the Commission; and 
 
 (b) the Commission informed the Consortium that it agrees in principle to the Consortium's proposed undertaking terms and therefore does not propose to intervene in the matter pursuant to section 50 of the Act , subject to the Commission's acceptance of appropriate undertakings under section 87B of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.4 Accordingly, the Consortium Members, ANS and DBNGP Holdings offer these Undertakings for acceptance by the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On 25 October 2004 the Commission accepted the Undertaking under sub-section 87B(1) of the Act on the basis that the Undertaking addressed its concern that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Alinta 2000's indirect interest in the DBNGP; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the fact that Alinta Network Services Pty Ltd ( ANS , now called Alinta Asset Management Pty Ltd ( AAM )) would undertake operating, maintenance and construction activities associated with the DBNGP 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 would give Alinta 2000 the ability to effect anti-competitive outcomes in the relevant downstream markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Clause 5.4 of the Undertaking provides that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Subject to clause 5.4(b), Alinta undertakes that no person who is a director or secretary or a member of the staff of Alinta or any of its Related Bodies Corporate (other than ANS) will be involved in commercial negotiations between DBNGP Holdings (and, or, EEWAT) with other Shippers relating to gas transportation on the DBNGP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Nothing in clause 5.4(a) prevents a person to whom that clause applies from being involved in commercial negotiations between DBNGP Holdings (and, or, EEWAT) with a particular Shipper if the Shipper consents in writing to that person being involved in the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) EEWAT and DBNGP Holdings undertake to give the ACCC written notice of all Shipper consents referred to in clause 5.4(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">For the purposes of clause 5.4, "DBNGP Holdings" refers to DBNGP Holdings Pty Limited, a member of the DBP group of companies ( DBP ), which own and operate the DBNGP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
