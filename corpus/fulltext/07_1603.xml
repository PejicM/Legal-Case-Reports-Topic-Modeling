 (Confidentiality of exhibits to affidavit) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By motion brought by notice of motion filed on 28 September 2007 the respondent (Veda) seeks orders restricting access to certain exhibits to an affidavit of Rebecca Ann Barbour sworn 30 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Ms Barbour is employed by Veda as its "Head of Call Centres".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For the purposes of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act), Veda is a "credit reporting agency" and carries on a "credit reporting business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The present proceeding is one of nine proceedings, each brought by an individual alleging the same causes of action against Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicants in all nine proceedings are identified at [6] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Each applicant complains that Veda furnished to one or more credit providers incorrect information relevant to that applicant's creditworthiness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The causes of action pleaded are in defamation and negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The orders to be made on the present motion will also have implications for the other eight proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The motion falls into two parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In the first part, Veda seeks to restrict access to exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8 to Ms Barbour's affidavit on the ground that those exhibits would disclose information that is confidential to Veda, and which, if disclosed, would be apt to damage Veda's business interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Veda seeks an order that access be restricted to counsel and solicitors retained by Mr Dale, provided they have signed an undertaking to the Court in a form annexed to the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">By that undertaking, each solicitor and counsel would undertake to the Court:
 
 (1) not to disclose the contents of the four exhibits to any person other than the Court and solicitors and counsel retained by the parties;
 (2) not to make any use of the exhibits, or of information or knowledge obtained by virtue of the access to them, other than for the purposes of the proceeding; and
 (3) immediately upon the conclusion of the proceeding to cause to be destroyed any copies of the exhibits or any part of them and any notes made by the solicitor or counsel in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">

5 Veda also seeks an order that upon the conclusion of the proceeding, the applicant's counsel and solicitors must destroy all copies of the said exhibits and any notes made or received in relation to the exhibits or any part of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 The other part of the motion seeks to restrict access to nine exhibits to Ms Barbour's affidavit that relate to the respective nine applicants, as follows:
 
 
 Applicant to whom Applicant in 
 Exhibit Exhibit relates proceeding 
 
 RAB13 Cindy Jayne Adams NSD 2006/2006
 RAB14 Shane Martin Dale NSD 1994/2006
 RAB15 Dianne Maureen Shields NSD 2001/2006
 RAB16 Eddie Fisher NSD 2003/2006
 RAB17 Jye Peter Marker NSD 1996/2006
 RAB18 Timothy James McGary NSD 2007/2006
 RAB19 Robert John Strange NSD 2000/2006
 RAB20 Trevor Stephen Taylor NSD 2002/2006
 RAB21 Aaron Gerrard Tyndal l NSD 2004/2006 
 

The notice of motion excepts from the order sought an exhibit where the applicant concerned consents to access to the exhibit being extended to the other eight applicants in the related proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The commercial confidentiality part of Veda's motion 
 The nature of exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8 
 
7 I turn now to the first part of Veda's motion, the commercial confidentiality part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">8 Two points may be made at the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">First, it is not obvious why Veda seeks both an order for destruction and the third undertaking referred to at [4]: they are in almost identical terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Second, since the same solicitors and counsel are representing all nine applicants, it would not be appropriate for them to undertake to use exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB4 and the information gained from them for the purposes of one proceeding, Mr Dale's proceeding, alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">9 Veda relies on affidavit evidence of Rebecca Ann Barbour, Veda's "Head of Call Centres" showing, in general terms, the nature of the contents of exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">10 Veda has devised procedures according to which its Call Centre in North Sydney responds to queries and requests from "consumers", that is to say, individuals in relation to whom Veda holds or may hold a credit information file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">11 In order to comply with the Privacy Act and the Credit Reporting Code of Conduct issued by the Privacy Commissioner under s 18A of that Act (the Code), Veda has produced "Business Process Documents" specifying procedures with which Call Centre staff are required to comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">These documents constitute exhibits RAB1, RAB2 and RAB3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Ms Barbour labels exhibit RAB1 "Investigations", exhibit RAB2 "File processing", and RAB3 "Complaints".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 The Business Process Documents were prepared by Scott Jamieson, legal counsel employed by Veda, over a period of two months in December 2006 and January 2007 with the assistance of Call Centre staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Business Process Documents reflect procedures which have been developed and observed at the Call Centre with only minor variations over the last ten years (prior to 1997 each state handled its own telephone queries from subscribers and consumers, and Veda established the Australian Call Centre in 1997 to centralise this activity).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">13 Section 18J of the Privacy Act and cll 3.8---3.15 of the Code require that Veda investigate any request made by a consumer for amendments to personal information included in his or her credit information file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The procedure which Veda follows is set out in the Business Process Document that is exhibit RAB1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 All requests for amendment and complaints are recorded on Veda's "Public Access System".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The original hardcopy of a request for amendment is kept by Veda for 12 months, after which it is shredded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">15 If a consumer persists in a request, notwithstanding notification by Veda that it refuses to make the amendment requested, the request is upgraded to a "complaint" and the complaints procedure set out in exhibit RAB3 applies to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">16 Veda allows credit providers or finance brokers who have subscribed to Veda's database to access that database to make inquiries and post reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Subscribers accessing consumer credit information in this way are able to take advantage of training provided free of charge by Veda which specifies the subscriber's obligations in relation to accessing and updating data held by Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Exhibit RAB8 is a copy of Veda's Call Centre Process Document which specifies the processes involved in keeping subscribers informed as to their obligations to correct information and to encourage the flow of information from subscribers about errors in, or the updating of, their credit information files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In relation to exhibit RAB8, Ms Barbour states:
 
 The document contains information as to Veda's business procedures which Veda has developed and which Veda wishes to protect for reasons of commercial confidentiality and because Veda asserts rights in the nature of intellectual property over that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The document reflects Veda's practice and procedure in dealing with subscriber enquiries over the period 2000 to 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

17 Mr Jamieson worked on devising the Business Process Documents full time for a period of two months, during which he sat with the people undertaking the various roles within the Call Centre so that he could observe, discuss and record their activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Ms Barbour states:
 
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The business process documents are of great value to Veda's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">They are integral to Veda's daily operations and particularly to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Veda's internal audit processes rely upon those documents in order to confirm compliance and the documents constitute the mechanism by which Veda ensures adherence to internal procedures and can demonstrate to regulators (such as the ACCC, Privacy Commissioner and Ombudsmen), Veda's compliance with legal requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The documents also enable Veda to work efficiently, and therefore cost-effectively, by being consistent in our processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Further, by ensuring compliance with legal requirements, the documents play a role in reducing the risk of legal action and assisting the business to operate profitably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The way a credit reporting business such as Veda deals with subscribers and consumers and carries out its obligations to subscribers and consumers is fundamental to the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The documents that outline the procedures that govern those activities are documents Veda does not want its competitors to have access to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I am concerned that if the documents were put into the public domain, Veda's competitors may be able to obtain the benefit of the considerable work Veda has undertaken in developing efficient and cost effective procedures over many years and, accordingly, replicate those procedures and gain a competitive and advantage by adopting Veda's own compliance procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Veda's main competitor is Dunn &amp; Bradstreet [sic --- Dun &amp; Bradstreet] which carries on business as a credit reporting agency throughout Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Further, I am concerned that if the confidentiality of these documents was compromised and if they were placed into the public arena, there may be a risk of Veda's security procedures being comprised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Business Process Documents contain very close detail about Veda's security procedures, that is, procedures aimed at protecting an individual's private information including containing details of how Veda ascertains whether an individual making a request is in fact the individual to whom the file relates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I am concerned that if those procedures were made public it could affect the ability of members of the public to fraudulently access private information of other people and thus compromise the security and privacy of that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The processes Veda has to establish those security procedures have taken many years to identify and develop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 

18 Senior counsel for Mr Dale objected to some of the expressions in this passage, such as "great value", "integral", "fundamental to the business", "may be able to obtain the benefit", and "may be a risk of ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I agree that these expressions are very general, but I admitted the paragraphs on the basis that their generality goes to weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">To some extent, the problem has been overcome by the agreement of both parties that I should be at liberty to examine exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8, and I have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">19 Having read exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8, I note that, as Ms Barbour implies in her affidavit, they record in detail procedures which Veda employees are required to follow in given situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I accept that Veda has a legitimate interest in ensuring that they are not disclosed to a competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A competitor would or might be interested to take ideas from the exhibits for the purpose of improving its own procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 However, I do not need to decide for the purpose of the present motion whether the documents constituting the four exhibits are to be characterised differently from the internal procedures manuals and instructions of many businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">A business proprietor has a legitimate interest in preventing disclosure of such documents that have not entered the public domain, and use of them against the proprietor's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">DR Capital Pty Ltd and Credit Repair Australia Pty Ltd 
 
21 Ms Barbour also sought to support Veda's application by reference to the role of DR Capital Pty Ltd (DR Capital) and its subsidiary, Credit Repair Australia Pty Ltd (CRA) in this, and related, proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Unlike Dun &amp; Bradstreet, DR Capital and CRA are not trade rivals of Veda: they are not credit reference agencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">22 It appears that DR Capital has been assisting, in ways not made entirely clear by the evidence, Mr Dale and the other eight applicants in the bringing and conduct of the nine proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Indeed, DR Capital introduced the nine applicants or some of them to the firm of solicitors that has instituted the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">23 According to an Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) search, CRA has one shareholder and director --- DR Capital and Richard George Symes respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">DR Capital has two directors, Mr Symes and David Colin McGrath, and two shareholders, Leah Symes and Karen Merle McGrath.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">According to the ASIC search, Mr and Ms McGrath are of the same address and Mr and Ms Symes are of the same address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">24 I infer that the solicitors for Mr Dale and the other applicants would feel free to show exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8 or communicate their contents, to representatives of DR Capital or CRA in the course of representing the interests of Mr Dale and the other applicants, unless I were to decide that they are not at liberty to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">25 Mr Dale has not led evidence as to the role of DR Capital and CRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">26 The evidence led by Veda, however, shows that CRA's business is that of assisting individuals in remedying allegedly erroneous credit ratings in respect of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On its website, CRA states that it is "a credit repair company who have [sic] assisted thousands to restore their credit ratings, assisting with both past and current credit problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" DR Capital's website redirects the reader to CRA's website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">27 Ms Barbour states that she is aware that DR Capital is paid fees for assisting consumers in making complaints to Veda or in requesting that Veda investigate the data on an individual's credit information file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">She states that people who identify themselves as being employed by DR Capital regularly telephone Veda's Call Centre or send correspondence to Veda, and that she has spoken to such callers herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">28 According to Ms Barbour's affidavit, a Google search of "Veda Advantage" results in a page displaying a sponsored link by CRA stating "Credit Repair Australia --- Explore Your Options!</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Call 1300 FIX CREDIT www.creditrepairaustralia.com.au" and "Got Bad Credit?</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Find out how you can repair your credit with a free consultation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">www.foxsymes.com.au".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">29 As noted above at [16], credit providers or finance brokers who subscribe to Veda's database are able to access it electronically to view a consumer's credit file in connection with an application for credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">DR Capital is a subscriber to Veda's database and frequently accesses it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Ms Barbour states that DR Capital's status as a subscriber is in its capacity as an "authorised agent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">She states that this characterisation refers to entities who act in a "broker type role in assisting an individual to obtain credit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">A search of access statistics for DR Capital reveals that between 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2007, DR Capital made a total of 7,406 inquiries of credit information files on Veda's database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">30 Ms Barbour states that DR Capital's accesses to the database are typically recorded on the consumer's credit file as being an inquiry regarding a term account for a zero monetary amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">She observes that this is unusual for access by subscribers who are credit providers or brokers assisting individuals to obtain credit, because in either of these cases the particular class of the application and the amount of credit being applied for are specified when a person's credit information file is accessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Ms Barbour suggests that DR Capital must be accessing credit information files for reasons other than assessing an application for credit by the person whose file is accessed, and that DR Capital is probably investigating some grievance or complaint by that person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">31 Ms Barbour summarises her concerns as follows: 
 
 I am concerned that if Veda's confidential documents become available to DR Capital they are likely to be used for purposes other than this litigation, or disseminated in such a way that they are made publicly available or accessible to Veda's competitors, or made available to persons whose interests are adverse to Veda, unless DR Capital is required to give an undertaking that it will not use the documents for any purpose collateral to this litigation, and will return and/or destroy the documents once the litigation is completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">

32 In this paragraph Ms Barbour suggests that the position of DR Capital may be accommodated if it is required to give an appropriate undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">33 No doubt it is in the interests of Veda and its subscribers that Veda's credit information files be accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It is not in the interests of either that an individual's credit rating be recorded as worse or better than it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">If it is recorded as worse than it is, the subscriber may refuse to grant the individual credit, thereby missing out on a profit it would otherwise have made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">If it is recorded as better than it is, the subscriber may grant the individual credit and suffer loss in consequence of his or her default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It follows that insofar as DR Capital is able to disclose to Veda any errors in Veda's credit information files, it is serving Veda's interests, as well as those of the individuals who are its clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Consideration 
 
34 It is not disputed that Veda's business systems are or may be relevant to whether Veda breached a duty of care to Mr Dale, and whether it enjoys the defence of qualified privilege to the defamation claim, which will be at issue on the final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">35 Some preliminary matters must be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">36 First, neither Ms Barbour's affidavit to which the documents were exhibited nor the four exhibits themselves may become part of the evidence on the final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Even if they do, an order could be sought and made under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) forbidding or restricting publication of them, although it would be premature to consider at this stage the possible or likely fate of an application for such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It suffices to say that the present motion cannot be considered on the basis that the exhibits will inevitably become available to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">37 Second, Veda has not served the four exhibits in question and there is therefore no question of Veda's having waived, foregone or abandoned any claim to keep them confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">38 Third, the exhibits were filed pursuant to a direction of the Court for Veda to 'file and serve any ... affidavits".</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Veda is to be regarded as acting under compulsion of law by reason of the direction (see Akins v Abigroup Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 539) just as it would be doing if it had been required to give discovery of the documents or to produce them in compliance with a subpoena or notice to produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Whatever the position may be when a party simply leads evidence on the final hearing without having been required to file and serve its affidavits in advance, that is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Veda would not have filed and served its affidavits and their exhibits if it had not been directed by the Court to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">39 Fourth, the principles of Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280 ( Harman ) signify that Mr Dale and the other applicants, and counsel and solicitors representing them in the proceedings, impliedly undertake to the Court not to use the exhibits or the information contained in them for any other purpose than that of the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The implied undertaking is reflected in para (2) of the undertaking proposed by Veda, set out at [4] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">No doubt solicitors and counsel will draw the implied undertaking to the attention of Mr Dale and the other eight applicants if they have not already done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The implied undertaking also applies, of course, to all the affidavits and exhibits that have already been served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It would be a punishable contempt of court if any of the applicants or any of their legal advisers were to make use of, or to disclose the content of, any of the affidavits or exhibits (including, but not limited to, the four in dispute) to anyone for any other purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">40 Fifth, O 46 r 6(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides that except with the leave of the Court or a Judge, a non party must not inspect, relevantly, an affidavit in a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I treat the reference to "affidavit" in the rule as embracing exhibits to the affidavit (in any event subr (4) of O 46 r 6 provides that except with the leave of the Court or a Judge, or with the permission of the Registrar, a non party must not inspect any document in any proceedings that is not referred to in subr (2) or (3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Although those rules are concerned with inspection of documents on the Court's files, it is noteworthy that Dun &amp; Bradstreet, DR Capital and CRA and their employees would not be entitled to inspect the exhibits in the Registry without leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">41 Sixth, I accept that exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8 are confidential to Veda, but, as noted above, I do not find it necessary to determine whether they are confidential in any way or to any extent different from the internal procedural records and instructions maintained by any business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">42 Seventh, in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Limited [2006] FCA 711 , which concerned discovered documents, Finkelstein J held that disclosure to a litigation funder was not caught by the implied undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">His Honour's reason was that a litigation funder, although not a party, was not a stranger to the proceeding and had a sufficient interest to be provided with the documents, or at least to those documents it needed in order to assess the merits of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">43 Neither DR Capital nor CRA is a litigation funder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Nor are they expert witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">On the present state of the evidence, it is not clear to me that they have any proper role in relation to the prosecution of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The evidence shows only that DR Capital and CRA:
 
&#8226; assist individuals to have their credit information files corrected;
 
&#8226; have acted as some kind of intermediary between the applicants and a proposed litigation funder; and
 
&#8226; introduced the nine applicants or some of them to their present solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">44 The conclusion I have reached is that the position of Mr Dale's legal representatives and Mr Dale (and the other eight applicants) should be left to be governed by the implied undertaking in accordance with Harman [1983] 1 AC 280.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I accept a submission of senior counsel for Mr Dale that his legal advisers should be at liberty to explain to their client, if and as and when they think appropriate, what the exhibits reveal, and to show the exhibits to him for that purpose, subject, of course, to their also explaining to him the implied undertaking he gives to the Court and the potential consequences for him of a breach by, for example, disclosing what he has learned from the exhibits to DR Capital or to CRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">As Toohey J observed in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council [1993] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 604 at 638, an undertaking by a litigant's legal representatives not to disclose to the litigant can give rise to considerable difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">45 One reason why I do not require a written undertaking from Mr Dale and his legal representatives is that to do so may be seen to diminish the importance and seriousness of the implied undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Undertaking number (2), at [4] above, is implied, and breach of it is just as clearly a contempt of court as if it had been given to the Court in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I would not wish to give currency to any notion to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">46 Prudence suggests that the legal advisers might well see fit:
 
&#8226; not to supply Mr Dale and the other eight applicants with copies of the exhibits; and
 
&#8226; to destroy their own copies after the final hearing and determination of this proceeding and the conclusion of any appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">47 On the present state of the evidence, it is not shown that disclosure to DR Capital and CRA would be for a legitimate purpose of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">48 It is important to note that the officers of DR Capital and CRA are not legal practitioners owing to the Court the duties of officers of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">There would not be available against them the additional and special sanctions that are available against solicitors and barristers for a breach of the implied undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">49 It seems sufficient for me to express the concluded view that I have stated above, and to leave the implied undertaking given by Mr Dale and the other eight applicants and their legal representatives in the proceedings to operate so as to preclude disclosure to the DR Capital and CRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Privacy Act part of the motion 
 
50 The basis of the second part of the motion, regarding the Privacy Act , is s 18K(1) of the Privacy Act which provides, relevantly:
 
 (1) A credit reporting agency in possession or control of an individual's credit information file must not disclose personal information contained in the file to a person, body or agency (other than the individual) unless [there follow a number of exceptions, the only one suggested to be relevant, being]:
 (m) the disclosure is required or authorised by or under law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">

Mr Dale does not dispute that the respective exhibits RAB13 --- RAB21 contain personal information that is recorded in the nine applicants' respective credit information files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">51 Veda's concern is to ensure that it does not itself contravene s 18K(1) by serving the exhibits on the solicitors who act for all applicants and who confer with representatives of DR Capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Veda has invited Mr Dale and his legal representatives to propose any means (other than an applicant's consent) by which it may be lawful for them to disclose personal information contained in, for example, Mr Dale's credit information file to the other eight applicants and to the representatives of DR Capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">52 Mr Dale has not contended that the para (m) exception applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Even if it did, (by reason of the fact that there was a direction for the filing and service of affidavits), the fact is that, by consent, affidavits have been filed and served only in the Dale proceeding, and so it is questionable whether the exhibits relating to the other eight applicants would be within the exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">53 Mr Dale has not contended that disclosure is required or authorised by law by reason only of the fact that the same solicitors represent all nine applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">54 Mr Dale has not suggested any means by which the exhibits relating to him or to any of the other eight applicants, may be lawfully disclosed to the other applicants or to DR Capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">55 In these circumstances, absent the consent of a particular applicant, his or her credit information file must not be disclosed to the other applicants or to any one else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">However, there appears to be no evidence of a threat of such disclosure and in the absence of such evidence, an order would be inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The respondent has properly drawn the matter to attention, and the solicitors and counsel representing the applicants, as officers of the Court, will be relied on to observe the prohibition in s 18K(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">CONCLUSION 
 
56 I propose to publish these reasons and stand over the motion to a date for the making of any orders, including orders as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">My present thinking is that there should be no order as to costs because both parties had a measure of success on the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In favour of Veda, I have held that at present exhibits RAB1, RAB2, RAB3 and RAB8 should be withheld from DR Capital and CRA, and I have rejected a submission made on behalf of Mr Dale that the exhibits should be treated as if they had become part of the evidence on the final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In favour of Mr Dale, I have not required that he or the solicitors or barristers representing him in this proceeding sign written undertakings to the Court, and have been content to allow their positions to be governed by the undertaking to the Court that is implied in accordance with the principles of Harman [1983] 1 AC 280.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Privacy Act part of the motion took virtually no time at all and was not seriously contested by Mr Dale.</sentence>
