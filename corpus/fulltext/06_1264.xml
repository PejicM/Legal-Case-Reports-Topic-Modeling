1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner ('the ACCC') made application to the Court on 15 March 2005 for various remedies for alleged breaches, by the Respondents, of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The remedies sought included declarations, injunctions and the imposition of pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The proceeding continued as a defended matter until March this year when an Amended Application, an Amended Statement of Claim and an Amended Defence were provided to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It was foreshadowed that leave to file these documents would be sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Amended Defence, in substance admitted the allegations made by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In its Amended Application the ACCC considerably narrowed the range of remedies which it was seeking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At the same time an agreed statement of facts and joint written submissions were filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The submissions were made in support of proposed orders to be made by consent to resolve the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 A copy of the agreed statement of facts, which I accept, is attached to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 Section 45(2) of the Act prohibits corporations from making contracts or arrangements if those contracts or arrangements contain, inter alia, provisions restricting the supply of goods to particular persons or classes of person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The maximum pecuniary penalty for contravention of s 45(2) of the Act is $10 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Section 76 of the Act directs the Court to determine a penalty which is appropriate 'having regard to all relevant matters including the nature and extent of the act or omission and of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission, the circumstances in which the act or omission took place and whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under [Part VI] to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">'
 
4 As the agreed statement of facts discloses the First and Second Respondents were party to an arrangement, entered into on or about 26 March 2002, under which it was agreed that the First and Second Respondents and their related bodies corporate would not sell, market or distribute alluvial garnet to customers in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and that another company which was party to the arrangement, GMA Garnet Pty Ltd, would not sell, market or distribute alluvial garnet to customers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The purpose of these arrangements was to prevent the supply of alluvial garnet by the First and Second Respondents and their related bodies corporate to customers in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and of preventing the supply of alluvial garnet by GMA Garnet Pty Ltd to customers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Another company which was party to the arrangement was Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The First and Second Respondents admit that, but for the terms of the arrangements just mentioned, Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd would have been likely to have been a supplier of alluvial garnet in Australia in competition with GMA Garnet Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The arrangements thus also had the purpose of preventing such competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The parties have agreed on the form of a declaration and injunctions and the proposed quantum of pecuniary penalties which it is submitted should be imposed on the First and Second Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It has been agreed that the proceeding be discontinued in respect of all claims made against the Third Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 It is proposed that there be a declaration that the First and Second Respondents contravened s 45(2)(a)(i) of the Act by making the arrangement with Garnet International Resources Pty Ltd and GMA Garnet Pty Ltd that contained the exclusionary provisions referred to in [4] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 In my opinion the proposed declaration is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It serves the public interest by making it plain that conduct of the kind admitted by the First and Second Respondents contravenes the Act: see ACCC v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at 333; Rural Press Limited v ACCC [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 The injunctive relief proposed would restrain the First and Second Respondents from again engaging in the admitted conduct in contravention of s 45 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The injunction is expressed to operate for two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It would not operate to preclude the making of contracts or arrangements which would not constitute a contravention of s 45 of the Act by reason of the provisions of s 45(6) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 In my opinion it is appropriate that an injunction should be made in the form proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is clearly expressed so as to make it plain to the First and Second Respondents what conduct on their parts is proscribed: see ACCC v Francis [2004] FCA 487 ; (2004) 142 FCR 1 at 39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 It is proposed that each of the First and Second Respondents should pay a pecuniary penalty of $762,500 within 60 days of the day of the Order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 As already noted, the Court is empowered, by s 76 of the Act, to impose pecuniary penalties which it determines to be appropriate in cases such as the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In a proceeding in which the parties reach agreement and propose that specific penalties should be imposed, the Court's response is guided by the principles outlined in the joint judgment of Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v ACCC (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 291.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Their Honours said:
 
 'There is an important public policy involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the Courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">' 

12 I have concluded that, in the present proceeding the penalties proposed are appropriate having regard to these principles and to the following considerations which are peculiar to this case, namely:
 
 &#8226; The Respondents admitted the contraventions and cooperated with the Commission in the ensuing enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">&#8226; The Respondents cooperated in the negotiation of a settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">&#8226; The Respondents had not previously been involved in any alleged contraventions of Part IV of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">&#8226; The financial position of the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">&#8226; Although it is admitted that the arrangement was entered into, no allegation has been made that any third party suffered specific loss or damage as a result of the two Respondents giving effect to the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">&#8226; Whilst it has been agreed that the parties entered the arrangement consciously and deliberately for commercial purposes, it is not alleged that the First and Second Respondents were conscious that the terms of the arrangements contravened the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">&#8226; The principal negotiators for each of the First and Second Respondents were both resident in the United States of America at the time at which the arrangement was entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">&#8226; The amount of the penalties, in my view, is, in each case, sufficient to have a deterrent effect on both the First and Second Respondents and other corporations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

13 For these reasons the proposed Directions and Orders will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>

<sentence id="s71">Garnet 
 
17 Garnet is a naturally occurring mineral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The garnet produced by a subsidiary of Barton Mines in the Adirondack Mountains is known as "hard rock" garnet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The garnet mined in Port Gregory, Western Australia is known as "alluvial" garnet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Most garnet mined in the world is alluvial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Hard rock is generally more angular and sharper than alluvial garnet and is sold for different applications at significantly higher prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Alluvial garnet is most commonly used as both an abrasive in the preparation of surfaces (garnet blasting) and as an abrasive in waterjet cutting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">18 Alluvial garnet is also used in other applications including:
 
(a) concrete and floor finishing products;
 
(b) anti-slip coatings;
 
(c) denim blasting;
 
(d) water purification;
 
(e) glass preparation; and
 
(f) electronic component surfacing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">19 Alluvial garnet is most commonly used in the following industries:
 
(a) shipbuilding/ship repair;
 
(b) industrial painting contracting;
 
(c) petro-chemical tank blasting;
 
(d) oil and gas industry (on-shore and off-shore) for cleaning drill pipes and well casings;
 
(e) aircraft and motor vehicle manufacturers;
 
(f) ceramic and glass producers;
 
(g) electronic component manufacturers; and
 
(h) filtration parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Worldwide garnet production 
 
20 The principal garnet mines in the world are currently operating in:
 
(a) Port Gregory, Western (alluvial);
 
(b) India (alluvial);
 
(c) United States (hard rock and alluvial); and
 
(d) China (hard rock)
 
In addition, there are similar mining operations in Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the Ukraine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">21 The Port Gregory mine in Western Australia and Indian producers are the largest producers of garnet in the world, the former representing around 35% of total world production in 2004 and the latter, approximately 50%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">22 GMA garnet and Indian garnet are from the same geological group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Known as almandine alluvial garnet, this garnet is the hardest variety in the alluvial garnet family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">23 Indian garnet competes around the world with GMA garnet, including Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, Canada, USA, the Middle East and Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The Australian garnet industry 
 
24 In 2004 Australian industrial users purchased approximately 53,000 tonnes of garnet per annum, which was sourced approximately as follows:
 
(a) 36,000 tonnes of GMA garnet; and
 
(b) 17,000 tonnes from India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">25 In 2004 industrial users in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia (the " Eastern and Southern States of Australia ") purchased approximately 35,000 tonnes of garnet per annum, of which 15,000 tonnes were imported from India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">26 In 2004 industrial users in Western Australia and the Northern Territory purchased approximately 18,000 tonnes of garnet per annum, of which 2,000 tonnes were imported from India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">27 Based on this tonnage, sales of garnet to distributors in Australia generate gross revenue in the order of AUD$12.8 million per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In approximate terms, gross revenue can be calculated as follows:
 
(a) GMA garnet
 
 (i) 20,000 tonnes (the Eastern and Southern States of Australia) x
 
 AUD$270 per metric tonne = AUD$5.4 million;
 
(ii) 16,000 tonnes (Western Australia and Northern Territory) x
 
 AUD$230 per metric tonne = AUD$3.7 million; 

(b) imported garnet 17,000 tonnes (Australia wide) x $AUD$220 per metric tonne
 
= AUD$3.7 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Substitutes for garnet as an abrasive 
 
28 In most parts of the world, garnet is considered substitutable for abrasives such as silica sand, coal slag, copper and other mineral slag, ilmenite, crushed glass, staurolite and high pressure water as well as quartz sand and manufactured abrasives such as fused alumina oxide and silicon carbide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Silica sand and mineral slag continue to be the most widely used media in blasting worldwide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">29 In Australia, garnet is the preferred alternative to conventional abrasives such as silica sand and copper slag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Use of silica sand as abrasive was banned in Australia progressively during the 1990's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Environmental concerns have also reduced the user of copper slag as abrasive in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Copper slag, however, is currently imported into Australia and remains a substitute for garnet in some applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">30 Ilmenite, a by-product of mineral sands production, is also used in small quantities as an abrasive in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">31 Crushed glass is also used in small quantities as an abrasive along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">32 Staurolite, an aluminosilicate mineral with similar chemical and physical properties to garnet, is also used as an abrasive in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">33 High pressure water may also be used as an abrasive in some applications, and steel shot may also be used in other specific applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">34 In coated abrasives, garnet falls between low-cost quartz sand and more costly manufactured abrasives, such as fused alumina and silicon carbide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">35 In addition, ilmenite, magnetite and plastics compete as filtration media; diamond, corundum and fused aluminium oxide compete for glass grinding and for many lapping operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Emery is a substitute in non-skid surfaces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Port Gregory mine --- plant ownership 
 
36 Garnet as first mined in Port Gregory in 1969 on a small scale by Target Minerals N.L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">37 In 1988 BJVC and BLA jointly acquired a 50% interest in the garnet mine in Port Gregory from Target Petroleum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">At the time of this acquisition the Port Gregory mine produced less than 10,000 tonnes of garnet per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">38 Shortly thereafter Target Petroleum sold its remaining 50% interest in Port Gregory to HGL's wholly owned subsidiaries GPNL and Garnet Millers Australia Pty Ltd ) (" GMAPL ") (ACN 008 908 227).</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">39 On 4 June 1998, BJVC, BLA, GPNL and GMAPL restructured from a production joint venture to a partnership (the " Garnet Partnership ") to conduct a business of exploring for, mining, processing and selling garnet
 
40 The terms of the garnet Partnership were recorded in a Partnership Agreement dated 4 June 1998 (the " Partnership Agreement ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">41 Pursuant to clause 3 of the Partnership Agreement, the partners owned the following interests in the Garnet Partnership:
 
(a) BJVC --- 13.83%;
 
(b) BLA --- 36.17%; and
 
(c) GPNL and GMAPL (in aggregate) --- 50%
 
42 Pursuant to clause 4 of the Partnership Agreement, the partners agreed that the assets of the Garnet Partnership would be held in the names of all the parties as tenants in common in accordance with their percentage interests in the Garnet Partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">43 On 25 June 1998, GONL acquired GMAPL's interest in the Garnet Partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Port Gregory mine --- plant operations 
 
44 From its formation, the Garnet Partnership engaged in the mining of garnet from tenements owned by the Garnet Partnership and located around Port Gregory, Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">45 The garnet ore is quarried from open pits by front end loader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is then treated through a wet plant on site at Port Gregory and later through a dry plant at Geraldton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">46 Pursuant to clause 9 of the Partnership Agreement, the partners agreed that they might engage or appoint a person to carry out such duties or functions in relation to the management or conduct of the business of the Garnet Partnership as the partners may determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">47 On 24 February 1999, BJVC, BLA, and GPNL entered into a Mining Services and Processing Agreement whereby they engaged GMA for a term of 30 years to provide to the Garnet Partnership all services required for and incidental to the day to day operation of that part of the business of the Garnet Partnership that involved exploring for, mining and processing garnet and other products including the mining of garnet and the processing and packaging of garnet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">48 At all material times between 24 February 1999 to 31 March 2005 GMA mined GMA garnet on behalf of its shareholders pursuant to this Mining Services and Processing Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Distribution of GMA garnet 
 
49 From its formation, the Garnet Partnership engaged in the processing and selling of GMA garnet to various distributors for distribution within and outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">50 At all relevant times from April 1991, GMA Garnet (Europe) GmbH (" GMAGE "), a company owned by the GIRL directors, was the exclusive distributor of GMA garnet in Europe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">51 At all relevant times from January 1990, Ketelsen Enterprises Pty Ltd (" Ketelsen Enterprises '), a company controlled by one of the GIRL directors, Torsten Ketelsen, was the exclusive distributor of GMA garnet in the Middle East.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">At all relevant times from September 1994, Ketelsen Enterprises was also a distributor of GMA garnet in South East Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">52 At all relevant times since 1991 until 24 April 2002, Barton Mines Company, LLC (an affiliate of BLA) distributed GMA garnet to North and South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">At all relevant times since April 2002, Barton Australia distributed GMA garnet to North and South America and North Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">53 On 24 February 1999, BJVC, BLA and GPNL entered into an Exclusive Distributorship Agreement whereby they agreed to appoint GMA as the exclusive distributor on behalf of the Garnet Partnership of all garnet and other products produced by or on behalf of the Garnet Partnership throughout the world, including Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">GMA was entitled to appoint sub-distributors and agents in connection with the distribution of garnet and other products produced by or on behalf of the Garnet Partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The appointment of GMA as the exclusive distributor on behalf of the Garnet Partnership did not interfere with the distribution arrangements referred to in paragraphs 49 to 51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">GIRL's acquisition of a 50% interest in the Garnet Partnership and GMA and the Perth Arrangement 
 
54 Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, BLA and BJVC had a pre-emptive right to acquire GPNL's interest in the Garnet Partnership and its shares in GMA if GPNL decided to exit the Garnet Partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">55 In November 2000, two of the GIRL directors (Mr Wolfhart Putzier and Mr Torsten Ketelsen) contacted the Barton Group and inquired as to its attitude regarding them acquiring GPNL's interest in the Garnet Partnership and GMA should GPNL be willing to sell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">56 The GIRL directors established that GPNL was willing to sell its share in the Garnet Partnership and GMA to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Following negotiations, BLA and BJVC agreed not to exercise their pre-emptive right over GPNL's interest in the Garnet Partnership and their shares in GMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">57 Pursuant to a sale agreement between GMAPL, GPNL, GIRL and various other persons dated 6 December 2001 (the " Sale Agreement "), GIRL agreed to acquire GPNL' s 50% interest in the Garnet Partnership and its to% shareholding in GMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Sale Agreement was completed on 26 March 2002, and on that date Mr Wolfhart Putzier and Mr Torsten Ketelsen were appointed directors of GMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">58 Immediately prior to completion of the Sale of Agreement:

 (f) GIRL did not supply GMA garnet in Australia, however, but for the provisions of the Perth Arrangement described below, there was a real possibility that GIRL would supply garnet in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">

59 BLA and BJVC's agreement not to exercise their pre-emptive right was conditional upon GIRL, Barton Mines, BJVC, BLA and GMA making an arrangement concerning the future operation of the Garnet Partnership and GMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">GIRL, Barton Mines, BJVC, BLA and GMA made such an arrangement on or about the completion of the Sale of Agreement on 26 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The substance of the arrangement was recorded in a document dated 13 March 3003 signed by GIRL, Barton Mines (under its trading name, The Barton Group), BJVC and BLA (the " Perth Arrangement ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">60 It was a term of the Perth Arrangement that each partner (being BJVC and BLA on the one hand and GIRL on the other hand) agreed to purchase from the Garnet Partnership and GMA in each financial year a minimum amount of GMA garnet equal to the greater of:
 
 (a) 50,0000 tonnes; or
 (b) the lowest amount purchased by either partner during the previous year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">

61 It was also a term of the Perth Arrangement that each of the parties to it and their related bodies corporate agreed not to sell, market or distribute alluvial almandite garnet abrasive and related products and components to customers within various geographic territories within Australia and the rest of the world, subject to limited exceptions as follows:
 
 (a) GIRL and its related bodies corporate agreed not to sell, market or distribute alluvial almandite garnet abrasive and related products and components to customers within the areas marked blue and purple on the map attached as Annexure A to the document dated 13 March 2002, which included all of Australia, for the period until 2 years after it ceased to own an interest in the Garnet Partnership and GMA;
