 Introduction 
 
1 On 29 January 2007 I made orders extending all current orders in these proceedings affecting the first, fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants to today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The plaintiff was required by close of business on 2 February 2007 to file and serve minutes of proposed orders to give effect to: 
 
 (i) the extension of the existing orders in relation to the first, fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth defendants; 
 (ii) the appointment of receivers pursuant to s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in relation to the tenth defendant and for associated orders along the lines applicable to other corporate defendants, the subject of Receiver Orders; 
 (iii) Asset Preservation Orders in respect of the twelfth defendant; 
 (iv) orders to give effect to the continuation of existing orders in respect of the sixth defendant, varied to take into account the appointment of administrators to the sixth defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">

Each of the proposed orders and extended orders referred to was to continue in effect until 30 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I reserved the costs of the interlocutory process for submission by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The application for extension of the orders presently applicable in relation to the eleventh defendant, Rold Corporation Pty Ltd (Rold), which was listed for hearing on 31 January 2007, is now listed for hearing on 26 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The new Receiver and Asset Preservation Orders 
 
2 The minutes filed were generally in accordance with the orders contemplated by the reasons for judgment delivered on 29 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The definition of "individual property" and "corporate property" the subject of the Receiver Orders and the Asset Preservation Orders require variation as they included "Individual Bank Accounts and "Corporate Bank Accounts" respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">These were terms used in the preceding orders but needed refinement as a bank account is not property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 In the orders relating to the first defendant I will vary that element of the definition of property in [3.7] and [3.8] to read: 
 
 
 '3.7 rights to operate the Individual Bank Accounts (as that term is defined in Order 4 below) and any chose in action in relation to such account; 
 
 but does not include: 
 
 3.8 such rights or choses in action in relation to any excluded Individual Bank Accounts (as that term is defined in Order 4 below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 

4 In the Corporate Receiver Orders affecting the fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth defendants, [3.7] and [3.8] will be varied to read: 
 
 
 '3.7 right to operate any Corporate Bank Accounts (as that term is defined in Order 4 below) and any chose in action in relation to such account; 
 
 but does not include: 
 
 3.8 such rights or choses in action in relation to any excluded Corporate Bank Accounts (as that term is defined in Order 4 below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">' 
 
 

5 The seventh and twelfth defendants, being the subject of private receiverships, do not have presently any Receiver Orders made in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They are, however, to be the subject of ongoing asset preservation orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">A similar problem arises with the definitions of "Bowesco Property" in relation to the seventh defendant and "Corporate Property" in relation to the twelfth defendant as arise in relation to like definitions in the Receiver Orders applicable to the other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 In relation to the Bowesco order [3.7] and [3.8] will now read: 
 
 
 '3.7 the rights to operate any Bowesco Bank Account (as that term is defined under Order 4A below) and any chose in action in association with such Bank Account; 
 
 but does not include: 
 
 3.8 such rights or choses in action in relation to any Excluded Bowesco Account (as that term is defined in Order 4A below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">' 
 
 

7 In the case of the twelfth defendant [3.7] and [3.8] will read: 
 
 
 '3.7 rights to operate any "Corporate Bank Account" (as that term is defined in Order 4 below) and any chose in action in relation to any such account; 
 
 but does not include: 
 
 3.8 such rights or choses in action in relation to any "Excluded Corporate Bank Account" (as that term is defined in Order 4 below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 

8 In each of the orders, Order 1 in the minute will be revised to read: 
 
 'Orders 2 to 23 made in these proceedings on [ ] as amended from time to time in relation to the [identified defendant] are as at the date of these orders replaced by the orders below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">' 
 

9 The term "mareva orders" which is used in relation to the seventh and twelfth defendants will be replaced by the term "Asset Preservation Orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 In relation to the twelfth defendant, [6] will be amended to read: 
 
 'These orders shall not prevent the twelfth defendant from paying reasonable fees and disbursements to the solicitors for the twelfth defendant as agreed with the plaintiff or, absent agreement, as approved by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 

 Costs of the extension proceedings 
 
11 The extension proceedings were opposed by the defendants in respect of whom the preceding orders have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Submissions were invited on the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Nothing was said on behalf of the defendants to disclose any basis upon which there should be a departure from the usual exercise of discretion in accordance with the proposition that costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Although the contest at the hearing was narrowed to a debate about whether or not receivers should be appointed, it does not seem that any prior notice of that narrowing of the debate was given by the defendants to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In respect of each of the defendants therefore I will make an order in the following terms: 
 
 'That the costs of the plaintiff's application for these orders is to be paid by the [identified defendant].</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 


 Receiver conflicts 
 
12 In the reasons for judgment delivered on 29 January 2007 reference was made to the possibility of conflicts of interest in the event that the Court appointed receivers or members of their firm were appointed by secured creditors, to the property of defendant companies or associated companies or to companies which might have claims against one or more of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The minute of orders submitted by ASIC following the judgment include a mechanism for ensuring that Court appointed receivers are alert to the difficulties which might arise in such cases and that they take appropriate advice so that if necessary an application can be made to the Court for directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">13 In an affidavit filed following the judgment and sworn on 2 February 2007, Mr McMaster, one of the Court appointed receivers, disclosed that members of his firm, KordaMentha have been appointed as receivers to "two property assets" of the tenth defendant Silkchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In his affidavit Mr McMaster set out the details of those two appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">They are as follows: 
 
 (i) On 24 January 2006 Perpetual Nominees Ltd, as custodian of the ING Mortgage Pool for ING Fund Management Ltd as the Responsible Entity of the ING Mortgage Pool (ING) appointed Oren Zohar, Mark Korda and David Winterbottom as the joint and several receivers of Silkchime over six strata lots located at the Warwick Healthcare Centre only (ING Secured Property).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The appointment is limited to the ING Secured Property and does not cover all of the assets of Silkchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The ING Secured Property has now been sold and settled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">There are no further steps to be taken in respect of its realisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr McMaster has been informed by Mr Zohar and believes that Mr Zohar is unaware of any allegation or any act, matter or thing that may give rise to a claim against the receivers in respect of the sale of the asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The receivers have not yet retired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">(ii) On 29 March 2006 St George Bank Ltd appointed Oren Zohar, David Winterbottom and Mark Korda to be the joint and several receivers and managers of Silkchime in respect of four vacant lots and one untenanted warehouse located at the property known as "Warwick Commercial Park" (St George Secured Property).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr McMaster says he is informed by Mr Zohar and believes it to be true that: 
 
 
 (a) the appointment by St George in respect of the St George Secured Property was made on 29 March 2006 pursuant to a charge registered with ASIC and a registered mortgage;
 (b) the appointment is limited to the St George Secured Property and is not over all of the assets of Silkchime; 
 (c) St George has realised assets other than the St George Secured Property sufficient to repay the debt secured by the security in full; 
 (d) St George has now instructed the receivers not to proceed with the sale of the St George Secured Property; 
 (e) Mr Zohar is unaware of any allegation or any act, matter or thing that may give rise to a claim against the receivers in respect of the St George Secured Property; 
 (f) the receivers have not yet retired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 

14 Mr McMaster also stated that on 24 January 2006 ING appointed Messrs Zohar, Korda and Winterbottom as joint and several receivers and managers of Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd in its own capacity and as trustee for the Warwick Entertainment Centre Unit Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Schedule H of the Report as to Affairs of Silkchime dated 2 March 2006, verified by Mr Carey, a director of the Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd, identifies an unsecured debt owing by Silkchime to Warwick Entertainment Centre in the sum of $12,673,372.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">15 No submission has been made by any party raising any difficulty in respect of these appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The latter appointment is referred to in the affidavit of Mr Zohar sworn on 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">At present there are no apparent difficulties arising from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">If and when a question arises relating to the enforcement of the Silkchime loan it would be prudent for the Court appointed receivers to take advice in respect of their position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Release of funds for payment of legal fees 
 
16 Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (Richstar) and Healthcare Properties Pty Ltd (Healthcare) seek orders approving the release to their solicitors, Mony De Kerloy of legal fees and disbursements in the sums of $40,878.04 and $68,362.09 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The proposed orders are supported by affidavits of John Dury, a solicitor employed by Mony De Kerloy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">17 It appears that the sums claimed represent a total of $81,756.08 for work done for both Richstar and Healthcare together with an additional sum of $27,484.05 representing costs directly incurred by Healthcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mony de Kerloy had separate written retainer agreements with both Richstar and Healthcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It appears from the affidavit material that the common work done also covered the costs of representing Mr Carey with whom Mony de Kerloy also had a separate retainer agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There were no retainer agreements in evidence with other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The solicitors for the receivers referred in their submissions to a separate retainer agreement made with Redchime but there is no such written agreement exhibited to Mr Dury's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Counsel who appeared for Mr Carey, Richstar and Healthcare announced his appearance on behalf of all other defendants, save for Rold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The solicitors on the record for Westpoint Realty Pty Ltd (Westpoint Realty), the sixth defendant, were then Clavey Legal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">However, Mr Clavey had no instructions in respect of these proceedings, did not raise any fees in respect of them and did not instruct counsel to appear on behalf of Westpoint Realty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Hammond Worthington were the solicitors on the record for Silkchime, the tenth defendant, and instructed Ms Coulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It appears that Mr Hammond has informed the solicitors for the receivers that his firm and Ms Coulson will issue separate fee notes in respect of Silkchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">18 The solicitors for the receivers referred to the separate retainer arrangements between Mony de Kerloy and Richstar, Healthcare, Mr Carey and (albeit unwritten) with other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The receiver's submissions pointed out that where there are separate contracts, each client is liable for its own share of the solicitors' costs, that is, a proportionate part of the general costs plus costs incurred exclusively for its benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">They contended that there is a presumption of several liability and the fact that a number of clients authorise a solicitor to act and say they will pay the solicitor does not mean that each has agreed to pay the whole of the costs and does not create a joint liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The solicitors for the receivers noted that ASIC had accepted the reasonableness of the fees raised by Mony de Kerloy and saw no reason to dispute that assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 Mony de Kerloy's position was that the work performed by themselves and their counsel was necessary to be done for Richstar and Healthcare whether or not they were instructed by other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The receivers, like ASIC, proposed that Mony de Kerloy seek an order that the Court receivers authorise the payment of the fees owing in respect of Richstar out of Richstar trust funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The question of an authorisation by the receivers does not arise in relation to Healthcare as that company, having private receivers appointed under a security, is the subject of Asset Preservation Orders rather than Receiver Orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">20 In their submissions to the Court the receivers repeated their position that Mony de Kerloy had entered into separate retainers with each of Mr Carey, Richstar and Healthcare, albeit there was no evidence of a separate written retainer agreement with Redchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">They pointed to the absence of evidence of retainer agreements with any of the other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">They pointed out that where a number of parties to an action enter into a single retainer with one solicitor each is presumed to be jointly liable for the costs incurred by that solicitor: Burridge v Bellew (1875) 32 LT (NS) 807.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Where distinct parties enter into individual retainers with a solicitor the presumption is reversed and each client is liable for its own share of solicitor costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The costs incurred are the amounts specifically in relation to that client and a proportionate share of general costs attributable to the other parties: Ellingsen v Det Shandinaskie Co [1919] 2 KB 567.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">They accepted that the presumption is rebuttable if evidence to the contrary is adduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">They submitted that the effect of making an order that Richstar and Healthcare pay the legal costs in effect on behalf of other defendants is that Richstar would bear those costs without any right of recovery from the other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">If Richstar were to pay more than its proportionate part of the common costs of the extension application it would be paying legal costs on behalf of the other defendants which it would have no right to recover from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">21 In my opinion the work done by Mony de Kerloy for Richstar and Healthcare was inextricably linked to such work as it was necessary to do for all defendants in relation to the extension application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">If it is accepted that the costs were reasonable, a position not disputed by either ASIC or the receivers, then the only question of principle is whether each of the defendants should bear severally a proportionate share of general costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In my opinion, whether or not there were separate retainers, the various defendants represented by Mony de Kerloy were effectively jointly represented and the presumption in favour of several liabilities should be displaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">22 The Court was assisted by counsel appearing for those defendants who had separate retainer agreements with Mony de Kerloy and for those who did not have specific retainer agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The representation assisted the efficiency and fairness of the hearing process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The issues with which each had to deal were substantially similar and substantially overlapping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It does not seem to be disputed that the fees raised against Richstar and Healthcare would have reasonably been raised against them if no other party had been represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">That is to say those fees were properly incurred to secure their legal representation even though that representation benefited other parties, whether they were the subject of retainer agreements or not and whether they were paying clients or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I do not consider that potential creditors of Richstar and Healthcare are thereby unfairly prejudiced as the representation was representation to which those two companies were entitled in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The orders relevant to Richstar and Healthcare will be incorporated in the general orders relating to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I do not propose, at present, to change the procedures by which legal fees and disbursements should be approved in relation to Healthcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French .</sentence>
