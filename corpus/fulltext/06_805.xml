<sentences>
<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The appellant, who has been identified for the purposes of these proceedings as SZBHK, was born in China in about 1956.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 30 April 1997 a passport was issued to him by the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 6 August 1997 he secured a visa to enter Australia on a short-term basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He departed from Shanghai on or about 25 August 1997 and arrived in Australia on or about 26 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 26 September 1997 he applied for a Protection Visa (866).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">No grounds were specified in the application for the visa but it would appear to have been accompanied by a typed two page document entitled 'APPLICATION FOR REFUGEE STATUS'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 That document referred to what was said to have been persecution of the appellant's father in 1957 for expressing his opinions as a member of a right wing party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant indicated that as a son of a right wing party member he had been beaten and discriminated against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This was said to have hurt him deeply in his heart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">No particulars of the circumstances of his beating or discrimination were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant referred to the fact that in 1978 the cultural revolution ended and China was ready to open its doors to the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 Mention was made of the 'China Modern democrat' and it may be inferred that the appellant was a supporter of that movement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is said that in 1986, when the appellant was about 30 years of age, he received 'checking and suppressing'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant says that in 1989 he went to Beijing and made contact with student representatives within a body known as the 'Beijing Workers' Self-government'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">After the massacre, which I would understand to have been a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, the appellant says that he escaped from Beijing to Fushuen and that he was dismissed from the company by which he was employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 He says that in 1994 he joined a 'China Democracy, Human Rights Federation' body headquartered in the United States of America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He says that from that time onwards he 'desired to escape China'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He says, without providing any particulars whatsoever:
 
 '... my experience tells my [sic] that if I go back to China, I would be arrested and Jailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 

5 The application for a visa nominated an address in Enmore as the current residential address in Australia of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The application was accompanied by a document described as 'APPOINTMENT OF PERSON TO ACT AS AGENT' which had been marked to indicate that all correspondence relating to the appellant's application was to be sent to the agent and if any information, additional documentation or action was required on the appellant's case the agent was to be contacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The nominated agent was Chun George Ao whose address was 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 The 'APPOINTMENT OF PERSON TO ACT AS AGENT' was signed by the appellant, as was a declaration forming part of the visa application which stated:
 
 'I declare that: 
 
 
 &#8226; The information I have supplied on or with this form is complete, correct and up-to-date in every detail 
 
 ... 
 
 &#8226; I undertake to inform the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs if I change my address for more than 14 days while my application is being considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 ...' 


 
7 By letter dated 13 October 1997 directed to the appellant at the address provided by him as his residential address, with a copy to his agent at the nominated address, the appellant was advised that his application for the grant of a protection visa had been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 On 12 November 1997 an Application for Review was lodged with the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Application for Review again nominated Chun George Ao of 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney, 2000 as the appellant's adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 On 13 November 1997 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant at his nominated 'home address' in Enmore, with a copy to Chun George Ao at 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000, acknowledging receipt of the Application for Review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 On 13 October 1998 the Tribunal wrote again to the appellant at his nominated 'home address' advising that the Tribunal was unable to make a favourable decision on the material relating to his application alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">11 A copy of that letter would appear to have been sent to 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">For some unexplained reason the copy was directed to 'K &amp; Z Marketing Pty Ltd' at the address in Sussex Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On 20 October the copy of the letter addressed to the appellant at his Enmore address was returned to the Tribunal marked 'no such person at address'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, it is clear that the copy directed to the Sussex Street address reached the appellant's adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">12 On 3 November 1998 the adviser rang the Tribunal to indicate that the appellant had not received his offer of hearing letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It would appear that mention was made of a change of address and the adviser was asked to cause notice of the change of address to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">13 On 6 November 1998 the Tribunal again wrote to the appellant at the address provided by him in Enmore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">That letter commenced:
 
 'We have received your "Response to Hearing Offer" telling us that you want to come to a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 


 
14 The letter nominated a hearing date and time which was Wednesday, 9 December 1998 at 9 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">A copy of the letter advising the appellant of this hearing date was also sent to the address 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Again, for an unexplained reason, it was also addressed to 'K &amp; Z Marketing Pty Ltd'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">15 The letter addressed to the appellant at his Enmore address was returned to the Tribunal on 12 November 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">16 On 23 November 1998 the Tribunal contacted the appellant's adviser to inform him that the letter sent to the appellant at his nominated Enmore address had been returned and that the Tribunal had not been told of any change of address in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The adviser indicated that he had difficulty in contacting the appellant as the appellant was 'always moving about and not informing him of any changes of address'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">17 The Tribunal informed the adviser that the appellant had an obligation to inform the Tribunal of any change of address and that if the Tribunal did not hear from the appellant it would proceed to make a decision on his appeal on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">18 It seems clear that no response was provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">19 The appellant did not appear before the Tribunal on 9 December at the specified time and place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Accordingly the Tribunal proceeded to decide the matter without the benefit of the appellant's assistance and by letter dated 10 December 1998 the Tribunal forwarded the decision and reasons for decision of the Tribunal, which was to affirm the decision of the Minister's delegate not to grant a protection visa, to the appellant at his Enmore address and to the appellant's adviser at K &amp; Z Marketing Pty Ltd at 340/401 Sussex Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">20 It is unnecessary in these reasons to deal with the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant before it was a political activist at risk of attracting the adverse attention of the authorities in the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It was not satisfied that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in China, due to his political opinion, were he to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">21 When addressing the Court, the appellant was asked to explain why no action was taken in respect of the decision of the Tribunal for over six years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The appellant's response was to the effect that it was merely his mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He attributed his default to his difficulties with the English language and his understanding of the laws in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">He also sought to visit blame on his adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">He asserted that he was not permitted to see the documents which his adviser held as they were secret documents belonging to the adviser's office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This is inconsistent with the case that he presented to the Federal Magistrate to which I will shortly refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">22 On 1 September 2005 the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia for constitutional writ relief in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The grounds set out in that application were as follows:
 
 
 '(1) I'm a citizen of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">If I go back to my country, I will be risk of suffering persecution, within the meaning of the 1951 Convention relating to the status of (RRT) Refugees and the 1967 protect [sic] relating to the status of Refugees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Member of RRT failed to understand my claims and failed to consider relavant [sic] matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Further particulars to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 


 
 
 (3) I seek relief under s38B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) on the grounds that the tribunal, at the decision to affirm the Respondend's [sic] decision not to grant me a protection visa in that it; I was not accorded natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 


 
 
 (4) The respondent refused to grant my protection visa application without any proper grounds and proper investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">' 
 


 
23 The application for review came before the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 December 2005 and was decided by the Federal Magistrate adversely to the appellant on 19 December 2005, although his Honour did order that his orders should not take effect until 31 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He made orders for costs against the appellant and on 18 January 2006 delivered supplementary reasons for judgment affirming his proposed orders in respect of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">24 In the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate reference was made to the appellant's desire to inspect his file as held by his adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">He said in his statement that his adviser said that the documents were hers and that the appellant could only look at them in her office, but could not take them away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">This assertion does not sit comfortably with the submission of the appellant before me that his adviser had said that the documents were secret documents which belonged to the adviser's office and which, as I understood it, he was saying he was not allowed to see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">25 The learned Federal Magistrate comprehensively reviewed the Tribunal's decision and was unable to detect any jurisdictional error on the Tribunal's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">His Honour found that it was probable that the appellant's agent was sent a copy of the letter appointing the hearing before the Tribunal on 9 December 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">His Honour's view was confirmed by the terms of the appellant's written account of his dealings with his advisers where mention was made of his attendance upon his advisers 'one day after his RRT hearing was scheduled' and of a conversation where the adviser inquired of the appellant as to why he did not go to the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">26 His Honour concluded that the appellant was not unfairly denied a reasonable opportunity to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">His Honour found that the appellant's absence from the hearing before the Tribunal was, '... due to his own omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">' 
 
27 The appellant appealed from the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate by a notice of appeal, which has been recorded as having been filed in this Court on 8 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The grounds specified in the notice of appeal were as follows:
 
 
 'a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Tribunal member refused to accept that the applicant have well founded fear of persecution 
 
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Tribunal failed to justify the evidence provided by applicant 
 
 c. Tribunal failed to determine that there were communicating difficulties between RRT and applicant' 
 
 

28 The first ground of appeal seeks a merits review which is not available in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The second ground of appeal is in the circumstances of this case meaningless as the appellant readily acknowledged that he provided no evidence to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The third ground is without substance as there was no default on the part of the Tribunal which may have justified a finding that there were communication difficulties between the Tribunal and the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">29 There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate in dismissing the application for constitutional writ relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">30 Notwithstanding that the matter has not been raised in the notice of appeal, it would appear that the appellant is now urging that he was let down by his own agent in a way which would warrant him having a second chance to present a case for review to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Amongst other things he says that he told his story to his adviser but never saw any of the documents which were prepared by the adviser, they having been signed by him in blank and completed later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It does not seem to me that the shortcomings of the appellant's adviser, if any, can properly be visited upon the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">31 At the time of the appellant's application for review to the Tribunal, namely 12 November 1997 through to the determination of that application by the Tribunal on 10 December 1998, ss 425 and 426 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) relevantly provided:
 
 ' 425(1) Where section 424 does not apply, the Tribunal: 
 
 
 (a) must give the applicant an opportunity to appear before it to give evidence; and 
 
 ... 


 
 
 
 426(1) Where section 424 does not apply, the Tribunal must notify the applicant: 
 
 


 
 (a) that he or she is entitled to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence; and 
 
 ...' 


 
32 In Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('Uddin') (1999) 165 ALR 243 at [22], Hely J described the two provisions to which I have just referred as containing '... cumulative requirements in the sense that the giving of a notice under s 426 will not necessarily exhaust the s 425 obligation ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">On the facts of that case his Honour did not find that the requirements of s 425 had been satisfied (see [19] - [20] and [30] - [31]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">33 In SZAXF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1464 ; (2003) 133 FCR 496, Stone J distinguished Uddin , saying at [26]:
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I have real doubts that, properly construed, the Migration Act as it was at the relevant time required the Tribunal to refrain from making a decision if, for reasons beyond its control, it was unable to contact an applicant in order to notify him or her of the opportunity afforded by s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 

34 It is important to remember that proceedings before the Tribunal are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal member conducting an inquiry is obliged to be fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">However, the Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of a case being advanced by an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In a case such as that brought by the appellant under his application for review to the Tribunal, it was for him to advance whatever evidence or argument he wished to advance and for the Tribunal to decide whether his claim that he was a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention had been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">35 The Tribunal was not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which the appellant may have chosen not to embark upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">36 In the context of administrative decision making, there would not appear to be support in Australia for the view that problems which arise in the conduct of the case of the person to be the subject of the decision through their mistaken view or that of their advisers could amount to procedural unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">There would seem to be strong policy grounds why this should not be the case (per Kiefel J in Freeman v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCAFC 335 ; (2004) 141 FCR 129 at [52] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">37 In my opinion, s 425 did not impose any greater obligation upon the Tribunal in terms of notifying an applicant of an intended hearing, than that found in s 426 itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I am satisfied that s 426 was duly complied with by the Tribunal in the circumstances of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It does not seem to me that there is any proper basis for disturbing the findings of the learned Federal Magistrate in respect of the notification of the intended hearing date to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In these circumstances, there is no proper basis for departing from the findings and conclusions of the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">38 In his Honour's reasons he indicated that even if he had found jurisdictional error, he would have refused relief on discretionary grounds (see [2005] FMCA 1834 at [26] - [29]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Constitutional writ relief is discretionary (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [54] , see also [5], [145] - [148], [172] and [217]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [80] and [211]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Circumstances in which it would be appropriate to decline relief to an applicant include cases where such an applicant has been guilty of unwarrantable delay, has acquiesced in the invalidity of which he now complains or has waived it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">39 It seems to me that the appellant's inaction for over six years before instituting his proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court would justify a refusal to grant relief on a discretionary basis independently of merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Once again, I consider that the learned Federal Magistrate's decision in that regard was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In any event, his exercise of discretion in that regard was one which, in accordance with established principles, should not be disturbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">40 For the foregoing reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Associate:
