 1 In this matter, Merkel J made an interim order on 20 December 2005 pursuant to s 241(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The order was made upon the provision of certain undertakings to the Court by the applicant, Sutton Developments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The substance of the order was that his Honour granted leave on an interim basis to the applicant to file a generally endorsed writ in the Supreme Court of Victoria in the name, and on behalf, of Nine West Australia Pty Limited ("Nine West Australia") against Nine West Group Inc and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The generally endorsed writ was subsequently issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 I have before me the next step in the process of obtaining a final order granting leave under ss 236 and 237 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">When the matter was before me on 15 February 2006, the parties had not reached final agreement as to the undertakings and/or conditions that should attend any grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On that day, I heard submissions as to whether ss 236 and 237 were otherwise satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The submissions were made on the basis that the parties expected, or at least hoped, that they would be able to agree upon undertakings and/or conditions attending the grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 I reserved my decision as to whether the statutory conditions that must be satisfied for leave to be granted had been demonstrated and adjourned the application to 22 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I did so to allow the parties time to reach agreement on appropriate undertakings and/or conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The parties have now reached agreement upon an appropriate set of undertakings and minutes of proposed consent orders which have been submitted to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 There are two relevant undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The first is, in effect, that the applicant will execute and deliver to the respondent's solicitors a deed poll which is attached to the minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The deed poll contains certain indemnities given by the applicant in favour of Nine West Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It is otherwise unnecessary to set out or to refer in any detail to the terms of the deed poll.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 The second undertaking is an undertaking by counsel on behalf of the applicant to procure that all solicitors, barristers, expert witnesses and lay witnesses retained by Nine West Australia in connection with the newly issued proceedings in the Supreme Court render charges to the applicant only, and not to Nine West Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Further, such persons are not to seek payment from Nine West Australia in relation to the proceedings in the Supreme Court, and their duties to Nine West Australia are in no way affected by entering into a retainer with the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Upon these two undertakings being given to the Court, the parties submit that the Court should, by consent, make, inter alia , an order granting leave to the applicant, pursuant to s 237(2) of the Act , to proceed with the newly issued proceedings in the Supreme Court in the name, and on behalf, of Nine West Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 I am satisfied that the conditions for a grant of leave set out in s 237 have been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is probable that Nine West Australia would not itself bring the proceedings as it is a deadlocked joint venture company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I am satisfied that the applicant is acting in good faith, and that it is in the best interest of Nine West Australia that leave be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I am also satisfied that the procedural requirement in s 237(2)(e) has been met, namely that at least 14 days before making the application, the applicant gave written notice to Nine West Australia of its intention to apply for leave, and of the reasons for applying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Finally, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 In the course of the hearing, I raised with counsel the question whether it was appropriate for this Court to accept undertakings of the kind I have described where the leave relates to the conduct of proceedings in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">My concern was that the ongoing supervision of the undertakings by this Court may be less than convenient in circumstances where the underlying proceedings are being conducted in another Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 Counsel for both parties submitted that it was appropriate for the Court to accept the undertakings notwithstanding this potential difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">They submitted, which I do not doubt, that this Court has power to make the necessary order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">They also submitted that Merkel J had already granted interim leave, and I was effectively concluding an application that his Honour had embarked upon by making interim orders on 20 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">They submitted that it is not unusual for a Court to retain, after final orders and undertakings have been made, the responsibility for dealing with any application arising from an alleged breach of the undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">10 It was also submitted that if any question of breach of the undertakings did arise in future, this Court would always retain, at that point of time, a discretion under s 1337H of the Act to transfer the application regarding the alleged breach of the undertakings to the Supreme Court if it considered that it would be in the interests of justice to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, that step might not be taken readily because it would be an undertaking to this Court which would be under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">11 On balance, I am satisfied, in view of the parties' consent and the submissions made to me, that it is in the interests of justice that I accept the two undertakings that have been proffered and that I make the consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">12 Accordingly, I will make orders in the form of the minute of consent orders that have been provided to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I will initial those orders, and place a copy on the file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The orders deal with all outstanding matters, including costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Associate:
