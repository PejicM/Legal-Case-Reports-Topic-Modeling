<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 29 May last I made orders convening a meeting of the members of SFE Corporation Limited pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The evidence satisfies me that that meeting was duly convened taking into account the signed certificates which have been provided and the undertaking which has been proffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The result of the meeting was a resounding yes to the proposed transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">No person has given notice of appearance to oppose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The matter was called today and nobody has appeared to oppose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 As I indicated when I made orders convening the meeting, I had scrutinised (without the benefit of a contradictor) the arrangement to ensure, so far as I could detect, that there was nothing on the face of it which might lead to a refusal of approval if the meeting assented to the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I saw no such barrier and none has been pointed out to me since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 I drew attention on that occasion to a question which arises as to the means of enforcing arrangements such as these, including (although not restricted to) issues about solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I am satisfied by the evidence that there is both the capacity to meet the obligations which are being undertaken and willingness on the part of those involved to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Indeed, there is every reason for them to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Under those circumstances there is no barrier to making an order approving the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I make orders in accordance with the draft minutes of order which I have initialled and placed with the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Associate:
