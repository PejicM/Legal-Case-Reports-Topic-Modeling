 Introduction 
 
1 On 12 April 1999 Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Limited ACN 087 088 202 ('Regis Towers'), then known as Cesscut Pty Limited, was registered as a proprietary company limited by shares in accordance with the Corporations Law , which applied as a law of the State of New South Wales by virtue of the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In accordance with s 119 of the Corporations Law Regis Towers came into existence as a body corporate at the beginning of that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 By virtue of s 1378(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act ') the registration of Regis Towers had effect, as from 15 July 2001, as if it were a registration under Part 2A.2 of the Corporations Act , its registration being taken to have commenced on 12 April 1999 (see s 1402(2) of the Corporations Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 By virtue of s 114 of the Corporations Act , Regis Towers needed to have at least one member and by virtue of s 201A(1) it needed to have at least one director ordinarily resident in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The comparable sections in the Corporations Law made similar provision in respect of the period up to 15 July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 As it transpires Cesscut Pty Limited was registered as a shelf company by Patricia Holdings Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It would appear that on 19 April 1999 the original share, a redeemable preference share allotted to Mr Dalgleish of Patricia Holdings Pty Limited, was duly redeemed out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On that day four ordinary shares in the capital of Cesscut Pty Limited were allotted, one to John Emmanuel Rose ('the bankrupt'), one to Penelope (also known as Popi) Rose, the bankrupt's former wife, one to Kerrie McInnes, a licensed real estate agent, and one to her son-in-law, Craig Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 On 19 April 1999 the registered office of Cesscut Pty Limited was changed to Unit 1, 724 Darling Road (sic), Rozelle, NSW 2039.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 On 28 April 1999 Cesscut Pty Limited changed its name to Regis Towers Real Estate Pty Limited and, on the same day, notice of the resolution changing the name, signed by the bankrupt, was lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">7 On about 6 May 1999 Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart withdrew from the new enterprise and transferred their respective shares to the bankrupt so that the shareholding became, as it remained thereafter, three ordinary shares held by the bankrupt and one ordinary share held by his former wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">At that time Mr Rose paid $218,750 to Ms McInnes to reimburse her for moneys she is said to have paid to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on behalf of Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He also paid, as he put it, $1 'across the table' to each of Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart to acquire their respective shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">8 On 18 May 1999 the registered office of Regis Towers was changed from 1/724 Darling Street, Rozelle to Unit 454, Ground Level, Regis Towers, 303 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, NSW 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The relevant notification to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 26 May 1999 was signed by the bankrupt and lodged on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">9 Thereafter on 1 June 1999 a notification of change to office holders was lodged with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, notifying the appointment of the bankrupt as a director and also as the secretary of Regis Towers on, so it was said, 19 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This notice was signed by the bankrupt and dated 1 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 The 1999 annual return of Regis Towers lodged on 29 February 2000 showed the registered office and the principal place of business of Regis Towers as 'John Rose &amp; Co Solicitors Suite 149 Level 2, 416 Pitt Street, Sydney, NSW 2000'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">That annual return showed the bankrupt as the sole director and the secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">11 It would appear that on 14 January 2003 the registered office of Regis Towers was further altered to become 'John Rose &amp; Co Solicitors Suite 459, Level 5, 311-315 Castlereagh Street Sydney NSW 2000'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That address became the principal place of business of Regis Towers as from 6 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">12 Whilst the position in relation to office holders of Regis Towers between 19 April 1999 and 1 June 1999 is not entirely clear, it appears that at least on 20 April 1999 the bankrupt was a director of the company and Kerrie McInnes was its secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 20 April 1999 the common seal of Cesscut Pty Limited was affixed to a deed between Cesscut Pty Limited and Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, the affixing being witnessed by the bankrupt as a director and Ms McInnes as secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That deed showed the address of Cesscut Pty Limited as 74 Spit Road, Mosman, NSW 2088, being the residential address of Mr Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">13 Ms McInnes' status as a secretary of Regis Towers is further evidenced by a deed made 6 August 1999 referred to as a 'DEED OF CONSENT TO SECURITY' between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, Owners Corporation for 'The Regis Strata Plan Number 58946 (sic)' and Cesscut Pty Limited of 74 Spit Road, Mosman, NSW 2088.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">That deed bears the common seals of Meriton Apartments Pty Limited ACN 000 644 888, The Owners --- Strata Plan No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">56443 and Cesscut Pty Limited ACN 087 088 202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 In the case of The Owners --- Strata Plan No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">56443 execution of the Deed clearly took place on 6 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">15 In the case of Cesscut Pty Limited the affixing of the common seal to the Deed was witnessed by the bankrupt as 'Director' and by Ms McInnes as 'Secretary'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It is common ground that, in relation to the execution of the Deed by Cesscut Pty Limited, this occurred before 6 May 1999 i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">the date on which Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart withdrew from the new enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">16 Regis Towers became a company under administration on 17 September 2004, Murray Roderick Godfrey ('the Administrator') being appointed as its Administrator in accordance with s 436A of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
17 By force of the presentation by John Emmanuel Rose of a debtor's petition in accordance with s 55 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act') and the acceptance thereof by the Official Receiver in accordance with s 55(4A) of the Act on 21 June 2005, Mr Rose became a bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In accordance with s 156A of the Act Robert William Whitton ('the Trustee') became the Trustee of the estate of the bankrupt on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">18 The bankrupt remained the sole director and secretary of Regis Towers from about 6 May 1999 until 15 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">However, he became disqualified from managing Regis Towers upon becoming a bankrupt (see s 206B(3) of the Corporations Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">By then, of course, Regis Towers was a company under administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">19 Expressed in the simplest of terms, the proceedings presently before the Court require determinations to be made as to whether certain assets should inure for the benefit of the creditors of Regis Towers or for the benefit of the creditors of the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The competing protagonists are the Administrator and the Trustee and each has pursued his case with appropriate vigour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">20 Proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 was commenced by the Administrator by an application filed 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It challenged a Notice given to the Administrator by the acting Official Receiver for the Bankruptcy District of New South Wales in relation to the estate of the bankrupt and also a Notice of Demand given by the Trustee to the Administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">21 On 15 May 2006 the Trustee filed a cross-application against the Administrator and Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Pursuant to an order made on 7 September 2006, the Administrator, personally, ceased to be a party to the cross-application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In the cross-application the Trustee seeks relief against Regis Towers under s 121 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">22 The applicants' claims in the proceedings were resolved on 22 June 2006, a series of declarations and orders being made by consent on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Responsibility for the costs of the applicants' amended application was also determined on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">23 The cross-application is one of the matters presently before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">On 9 August 2006 leave was granted, by consent, to the Trustee to proceed with the cross-application against Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">24 The other matter presently before the Court, matter No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">NSD 1657 of 2006, is an application, filed 29 August 2006, under s 104 of the Act by Regis Towers for review of a decision of the Trustee under s 102(1)(c) of the Act to reject a proof of debt lodged by Regis Towers with the Trustee in accordance with s 84 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">This application was filed after Regis Towers filed a 'Second Cross Application' against the Trustee in proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 on 17 July 2006, in which substantially the same relief had been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">25 On 7 September 2006 the Court ordered that the cross-application in proceeding NSD 641 of 2006 and proceeding NSD 1657 of 2006 be heard together with evidence in one matter to be evidence in the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">26 On 14 July 2006 the Trustee filed an amended cross-application in NSD 641 of 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That cross-application was superseded by a further amended cross-application filed 10 October 2006 which, in turn, was superseded by a second further amended cross-application filed 17 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">27 The cross-application falls to be determined by reference to a Second Further Amended Points of Cross-Claim filed 17 October 2006 and Points of Defence thereto filed by Regis Towers on 18 October 2006, the sixth and seventh days respectively, of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">28 In relation to the review of the rejection of Regis Towers' proof of debt in NSD 1657 of 2006 the Trustee filed a 'Notice Stating Grounds of Opposition to Application, Interim Application or Petition' on 19 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">29 Section 121 of the Act was amended by the Bankruptcy Legislation (Anti-avoidance) Act 2006 (Cth) which, relevantly commenced on 31 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">However the amendments only applied to transfers of property made on or after 31 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Accordingly, the new provisions have no application to the facts of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">30 At the time of the transfers of property in relation to which the Trustee seeks relief s 121 of the Act provided as follows:
 
 '121(1) A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the property would probably have become part of the transferor's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property had not been transferred; and 
 
 (b) the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was: 
 
 (i) to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor's creditors; or 
 
 (ii) to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor's creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 (2) The transferor's main purpose in making the transfer is taken to be the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b) if it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the ways of establishing the transferor's main purpose in making a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 (4) Despite subsection (1), a transfer of property is not void against the trustee if: 
 
 (a) the consideration that the transferee gave for the transfer was at least as valuable as the market value of the property; and 
 
 (b) the transferee did not know that the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b); and 
 
 (c) the transferee could not reasonably have inferred that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 (5) The trustee must pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any consideration that the transferee gave for a transfer that is void against the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 (6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the following have no value as consideration: 
 
 (a) the fact that the transferee is related to the transferor; 
 
 (b) if the transferee is the spouse or de facto spouse of the transferor --- the transferee making a deed in favour of the transferor; 
 
 (c) the transferee's promise to marry, or to become the de facto spouse of, the transferor; 
 
 (d) the transferee's love or affection for the transferor; 
 
 (7) This section does not apply to a transfer of property under a debt agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 (8) This section does not affect the rights of a person who acquired property from the transferee in good faith and for at least the market value of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 (9) For the purposes of this section: 
 
 (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and 
 
 (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and 
 
 (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 (emphasis in original)
 

31 In s 5(1) of the Act 'property' is defined as follows:
 
 '5(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 ... 
 
 
 property means real or personal property of every description, whether situate in Australia or elsewhere, and includes any estate, interest or profit, whether present or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to any such real or personal property;' 
 
 

In s 5(2) and 5(3) of the Act solvency and insolvency are defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">These sections provide as follows:
 
 
 '5(2) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 (3) A person who is not solvent is insolvent .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">' 
 
 
 (emphasis in original) 
 
 

32 In Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670, Barwick CJ said:
 
 'Insolvency is ... an inability to pay debts at they fall due out of the debtor's own money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">But the debtor's own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time---relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances, including the nature of the business, of the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The conclusion of insolvency ought to be clear from a consideration of the debtor's financial position in its entirety and generally speaking ought not to be drawn simply from evidence of a temporary lack of liquidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is the debtor's inability, utilising such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets, to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">...' 

33 In Expo International Pty Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liq) v Chant [1979] 2 NSWLR 820 at 837-9, Needham J said in relation to a company's solvency:
 
 '"Solvent" ... does not mean ... merely an absence of creditors knocking at the door.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">A company is not necessarily solvent on a particular day if it was, on that day, in a position to meet any demand lawfully made by a creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It may be necessary to investigate the sources from which such payments might be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">If, for example, the company could pay one debt only by borrowing from someone else, its solvency could come into question: cf Re Australian Co-operative Development Society Ltd. It is clear that a lack of liquidity is not equivalent to insolvency; I think the converse is also true, namely, that the fact that a company has liquid assets is not conclusive of its solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 ... 
 ... What he is saying [referring to Barwick CJ's judgment in Sandell v Porter ] , in my opinion, is that, if temporary inability to pay debts is established, one can look at the debtor's asset position to see whether the temporary embarrassment is caused only by a lack of liquidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">If it is, then one should take account of readily realisable assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Of course, it follows that, in doing so, one is looking to the future and, in my opinion, if one does so in order to see whether a temporary lack of liquidity can be overcome, one cannot overlook debts which will become payable during the period in which the lack of liquidity is being cured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">' 
 

34 In relation to a trustee's consideration of proofs of debt s 102 of the Act relevantly provided:
 
 '102(1) The trustee shall examine each proof of debt and the grounds of the debt sought to be proved and, ... shall, ... either: 
 
 (a) admit the proof of debt in whole; 
 
 (b) admit it in part and reject it in part; 
 
 (c) reject it in whole; or 
 
 (d) require further evidence in support of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 (2) Where the trustee rejects a proof of debt in whole or in part, he or she shall inform the creditor by whom it was lodged, in writing, of the grounds of the rejection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 ...' 
 

35 In relation to appeals against decisions of a trustee in respect of proofs of debt, s 104 relevantly provided:
 
 ' 104(1) A creditor ... may apply to the Court for review of a decision of the trustee under subsection 102(1) ... in respect of a proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 (2) The Court may, upon the application, confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 (3) Subject to the power of the Court to extend the time, an application under this section to review a decision shall not be heard by the Court unless it was made within 21 days from the date on which the decision was made.</sentence>

 Payments 
 
78 The evidence does not exhaustively detail all relevant payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">79 What is known is that on 20 April 1999 Kerrie McInnes drew a number of cheques on a bank account in her name at the Jannali, NSW branch of Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">At least three of those cheques were drawn in favour of 'Meriton Apartments P/L'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Those cheques were in the following amounts:
 Cheque No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Amount of Cheque 371 $82,500 372 $15,900 374 $16,500 
 
 
80 It would appear that the cheque number 372 was drawn by Ms McInnes in favour of Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' to cover the deposit payable by Regis Towers under the contract for the purchase of the proposed Lot 488 in the strata plan which became Strata Plan No 61369.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">It is common ground that Ms McInnes' cheques were used to meet all the deposit obligations of Regis Towers under the several contracts entered into by Regis Towers on 20 April 1999 with Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and/or Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Such cheques appear to have totalled $218,750.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">81 As part of the arrangement between the bankrupt, his former wife, Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart for the withdrawal of Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart from the joint enterprise it became necessary for the bankrupt to reimburse Ms McInnes for the $218,750 she had paid on Regis Towers' behalf by way of deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">82 As indicated above, the bankrupt did so on or about 6 May 1999, raising the necessary funds by borrowing $327,000 from Raymond Howes and Helen Linsey Howes, Peter Cole and Dorothy Cole, Thomas and Pamela Bradshaw, Alice Pauline Edwards and Lesley Berry, third party mortgage security being provided by Popi Rose's parents, Christos Pappas and Eugenia Pappas over their property known as 14 Birchgrove Road, Balmain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">83 On 6 May 1999 the bankrupt authorised and directed the solicitors for the lenders to pay the amount of $327,000 as follows:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Kerrie McInnes $218,750.00
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Nugent Wallman &amp; Carter (the lenders' solicitors in 
respect of the lenders' legal costs) $3,214.00
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Land Titles Office in respect of registration fees for the mortgage $56.00
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Office of State Revenue (stamp duty on the mortgage) $1,249.00
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The bankrupt $103,731.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">

 The direction to pay the amount advanced in that way was also signed by Mr and Mrs Pappas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">84 It is common ground that on or about 6 May 1999 Kerrie McInnes received $218,750.00 borrowed by the bankrupt as aforesaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">85 On 6 August 1999 the bankrupt drew a cheque (number 007) in the sum of $257,814.51 on a Cash Management Call Account in his name at the Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney branch of Commonwealth Bank of Australia in favour of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The cheque butt recorded the purpose of the payment as 'Settlement of Management Rights'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">86 It will be recalled that 6 August 1999 was the date that the Caretaker-Management agreement bore, even though it was not executed by Regis Towers until 17 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">6 August 1999 was also the date on which Regis Towers settled the purchase of Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443 and also Lot 454 in Strata Plan No 58946 from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">By virtue of the settlement of the purchase of Lot 454, $1,017,500 became payable by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under the head agreement made 20 April 1999 (see clause 3.1(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">87 The bank statement in respect of the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account shows that cheques 007, 008 and 009 were all cleared through the account on 9 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The bankrupt's secretary, Rada Popovski, noted on the bank statement for the period 13 July 1999 to 6 September 1999 that cheque 007 in the amount of $257,814.51 was for 'Settlement of Management Rights', cheque number 008 in the sum of $35,790.89 was for 'Settlement 149 PT', which I would understand to be a reference to Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443, and cheque 009 in the sum of $14,499.47 was for 'Settlement 454 CT', which I would understand to be a reference to Lot 454 in what was in fact Strata Plan 58946.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">88 The balance of the $1,017,500.00 payable by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited pursuant to clause 3.1(b) of the head agreement of 20 April 1999, upon the settlement of the purchase of Lot 454 on 6 August 1999, was provided by an unsecured loan in the sum of $770,000 from Meriton Finance Pty Limited to Regis Towers dated 6 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">A form of mortgage document over unidentified real estate was stamped in respect of a total advance of $770,000 on 6 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">89 The bankrupt appears to have opened the above-mentioned Cash Management Call Account on 13 July 1999 with a deposit of $491,232.92.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The closing credit balance on the account as at 6 September 1999 was $45,765.55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">90 The bankrupt obtained the amount of $491,232.92, which was credited to his Cash Management Call Account on 13 July 1999 by mortgaging Lot 24 in DP 192676 being the property known as 736 Darling Street, Rozelle of which, at the time, the bankrupt and his brother Nicholas Rose were registered proprietors as tenants in common in equal shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The bankrupt held a power of attorney from his brother Nicholas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">He proceeded to mortgage the Darling Street, Rozelle property in favour of Permanent Trustee Australia Limited, having secured a revaluation of the property from Alcorn Lupton &amp; Associates on 14 May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">91 I would interpolate that a standard technique employed by the bankrupt to generate cash flow both for himself and Regis Towers was to acquire properties at one price, funding a significant proportion of the purchase price with borrowed funds secured over the property purchased, then obtaining revaluations of the properties at higher amounts, which valuations were used to obtain refinancing of the properties in greater sums, thereby allowing the original financier to be paid and surplus funds generated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">92 Part of a bank statement referable to the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account for the period 16 November --- 1 December 1999 is in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">It indicated that there was a credit balance in the account as at 16 November of $422,287.27 which rose to a credit balance of $428,100.89 as at 30 November 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">A further extract from a bank statement covering the period 7 December 1999 to 24 December 1999 in respect of the Cash Management Call Account shows it as having a credit balance as at 7 December 1999 of $58,374.79 and a closing credit balance as at 24 December 1999 of $18,553.29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">93 Neither of the last two mentioned extracts from bank statements referable to the bankrupt's Cash Management Call Account shows the payment of cheque number 112, although a strong inference is available that it was presented for payment and paid in the first week of December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">94 The cheque butt referable to cheque number 112 indicates that is was drawn on 2 December 1999 in the sum of $361,103.28 and made payable to 'Meriton Apartments' for 'settlement' of Lots 501 ($26,663.40), 488 ($35,925.48), 489 ($39,188.67) and 650 ($259,325.73).</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">95 From the foregoing it may be inferred that out of the amount of $361,103.28 paid by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments on or about 2 December 1999 , $26,663.40 was paid in relation to the settlement of the purchase by the bankrupt and his former wife, Popi Rose, of Lot 501, the balance of $334,439.88 having been paid by the bankrupt in relation to the settlement of purchases by Regis Towers of Lots 488, 489 and 650 in Strata Plan No 61369 from Meriton Property Management Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">96 It may be observed that on 3 December 1999 Meriton Finance Pty Limited lent $455,000 to Regis Towers to facilitate the final payment of $601,250 by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited which was due under clause 3.1(c) of the Head Agreement dated 20 April 1999 upon the settlement of the sale of Lot 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">On 3 December 1999, Meriton Finance Pty Limited also lent $315,000 to Regis Towers on the security of Lot 650 in Strata Plan No 61369 to facilitate the settlement of its purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The payment by the bankrupt of $259,325.73 to 'Meriton Apartments' referred to above covered not only the balance due to Meriton Property Management Pty Limited as vendor of Lot 650 in DP 61369 but also the balance due to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under clause 3.1(c) of the Head Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Regis Towers' Proof of Debt 
 
97 By letter dated 28 February 2006 the Trustee forwarded to the Administrator a proof of debt asserting that Regis Towers was indebted to the bankrupt in the sum of $288,062.79.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The covering letter included:
 
 'I refer to previous communications and enclose a proof of debt in relation to amounts not claimed under my caveat or pursuant to the Section 139ZQ notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">
 
 I reserve my right to lodge further claims, including in relation to the amounts claimed under my caveat and pursuant to the Section 139ZQ notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">' 
 

98 By letter dated 20 March 2006 the Administrator responded to the Trustee's proof of debt dated 28 February 2006 stating, inter alia:
 
 'As discussed below I am of the opinion most if not all the amounts claimed have been accounted for by the Company in the director's loan account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Consequently, as the director's loan account is in debit there is no claim by Mr Rose against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">' 
 

99 The Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006 concluded with the making by Regis Towers of a claim of indebtedness on the part of the bankrupt to Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Under the heading ' Further Proof of Debt ' the Administrator's letter continued:
 
 'I attach an additional proof of debt in the estate for $483,970.21 being the balance of the director's loan account as at 31 December 2003 ... 
 
 I have attached a CD containing copies of the accounts and the loan account transaction account for your information in support of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">' 
 

100 The proof of debt forwarded to the trustee under cover of the Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006 was in the form of a 'Statement of Claim and Proxy Form'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The form was signed by the Administrator on behalf of Regis Towers on 13 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">It described the relationship between the bankrupt and Regis Towers as:
 
 'DEBTOR IS A FORMER DIRECTOR OF REGIS TOWERS REAL ESTATE PTY LTD' 
 

Particulars of the transactions/circumstances giving rise to Regis Towers' claims were:
 
 'LOAN ACCOUNT 
 
 As per attached accounts $483,970.21' 
 
 
 

101 The Trustee acknowledges that the 'Statement of Claim and Proxy Form' lodged by Regis Towers with him under cover of the Administrator's letter dated 20 March 2006 constituted a Proof of Debt within the meaning of s 102 of the Act which the Trustee rejected in whole in accordance with s 102(1)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">102 A ledger account number 2140 in respect of 'Loans to directors' for the year ended 30 June 2000 was prepared for Regis Towers by Mr Harris of Messrs Harris Cottis, an accountant who was retained by the bankrupt in about 2002 to prepare a tax return for him for the financial year ended 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Mr Harris also prepared financial accounts for Regis Towers for the periods ended 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001 at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">103 The sole director of the company in the financial year ended 30 June 2000 was the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">His loan account in the books of the company prepared as mentioned above contained 90 entries recording what were said to be some 63 payments made by Regis Towers on the bankrupt's behalf and three receipts of monies from the bankrupt, although the details of those receipts are imprecise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">There was one minor accounting adjustment in respect of an amount of one cent and 23 journal entries, one said to have been made on 1 July 1999 in respect of an amount of $4 and 22 entries said to have been made on 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The evidence is that the journal entries were initiated by Mr Harris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">However, the evidence does not support the conclusion that the journal entries were made in accordance with the bankrupt's instructions or with his acquiescence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Indeed, the evidence is that the bankrupt only recently saw the ledger account detailing the journal entries for the first time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">104 Were the entries in the ledger account reflective of the true indebtedness of Regis Towers to the bankrupt and of the bankrupt to Regis Towers it would follow that as at 30 June 2000 the bankrupt owed Regis Towers $7,875.46 being the product of deducting all of the credits totalling $1,458,365.65 from $1,466,241.11 being the total of all of the debits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">105 The Trustee has acknowledged that if the 30 June 2000 balance of $7,875.46 was truly owing by the bankrupt to Regis Towers as at 30 June 2000, then it would follow that the amount owing by the bankrupt to Regis Towers at 31 December 2003, being the date mentioned in the Administrator's letter of 20 March 2006, would be $483,970.21 as claimed by Regis Towers, subject to one matter to which I will return later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">106 The primary issue in respect of the rejection by the Trustee of Regis Towers' proof of debt revolves around the reliability of the stated indebtedness as at 30 June 2000 of the bankrupt to Regis Towers of $7,875.46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">107 Of critical significance to the establishment of the starting figure of $7,875.46 is the debiting to the bankrupt's loan account of an amount of $1,198,969.72 by journal entry on 30 June 2000 described simply as 'Take up Balance of Funds Borrowed per li'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">108 The credit side of the journal entry whereby the bankrupt's loan account was debited with $1,198,969.72 is to be found in a ledger account number 3565 produced by Mr Harris and described as 'Loans from other persons'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">This ledger account shows an indebtedness by the company to a person or persons unknown of $3,378,800 made up of 'reallocation' $2,179,830.28 and 'Take up Balance of Funds Borrowed per li' in the amount of $1,198,969.72.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">109 The 'reallocation' in the sum of $2,179,830.28 is itself the subject of a journal entry made by Mr Harris on 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">No evidence has been provided to found Mr Harris' journal entries in the amounts mentioned and, in particular, the journal entry referrable to the amount of $1,198,969.72.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">110 In relation to the making of journal entries generally Mr Harris gave the following evidence:
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">'Can you recall whether or not in either of the two years in which you were involved you initiated journal entries?</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">'

<sentence id="s329">' 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">'Not specifically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">It wasn't a matter of him identifying the transaction and saying, that shouldn't be there it should be over here or in a different account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">There were instances where he was not sure about certain things and wanted me to have a look at the transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">' 
 ... 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">'So this is the position, that the journal entries that one finds in the general ledger were done by you and your staff; is that correct?</sentence>

<sentence id="s336">'Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">'

<sentence id="s347">'By and large, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">'

<sentence id="s354">' 
 


 
111 Mr Harris' evidence in relation to the journal entry in respect of $1,198,969.72 included the following:
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">' ... you can't tell the court, can you, what transactions that amount relates to, that is, the $1,198,969.72?</sentence>

 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">'Can you tell me what the journal entry was that is posted here that entitled you or that provided the basis for the recognition by the company of an indebtedness ... by him of $1,198,000?</sentence>

<sentence id="s370">'I don't recall.</sentence>

<sentence id="s372">'

 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">'Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">' 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">'From what you've earlier told me, you would agree with me, wouldn't you, that that's a balancing entry that would have been made by your staff and was not something done at the direction of Mr Rose, correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">' 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">'I think that entry was made by my staff, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">' 
 ... 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">'... are you able to say what the take up balance of funds borrowed per LI refers in the accounts of the company?</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">' 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">'I'm not sure ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">I believe that it may refer possibly to line of credit ... and I think what would've happened there we would've calculated the total loans and we'd need to balance them off with where the funds went or came from and we ended up with that figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">' 
 ... 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">'... in relation to that entry you were asked questions about in respect of the $1,198,969.72 the position is you are not able to say whether that relates to any moneys that were actually borrowed from the company by Mr Rose; correct?</sentence>

 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">'I don't recall exactly how that's made up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">That's the simple answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">' 
 
 

112 In respect of an amount of $3,378,800, Mr Harris swore an affidavit on 28 August 2002 in proceeding number 4074 of 2002 in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">That affidavit included the following:
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">I have been informed by John Rose, the director of the Plaintiff [referring to Regis Towers] , and believe, that part but not all of the amounts shown as "Non Current Liabilities Unsecured Loans from other persons - $3,378,800" is in fact secured by mortgages over real estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Respectively, the borrowings making up that sum are as follows: 
 
 
 
 Permanent Trustee Australia $300,000 
 Sydney Wyde Mortgage Management $475,000 
 Belmore Investments Pty Limited $466,000 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $270,300 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $297,500 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $455,000 
 Meriton Apartments Pty Limited $770,000 
 Wizard Home Loans $ 345,000 
 $3,378,800' 
 
 

113 In the said affidavit Mr Harris said:
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">I have been retained by John Rose as his accountant for a period in excess of 15 years, although I understand he has engaged other accountants for different purposes from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">As a result of my professional relationship with Mr Rose, I have been involved in dealings with the plaintiff of which Mr Rose and his wife Popi Rose are the shareholders and Mr Rose the sole director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">I have been the accountant for the plaintiff since its incorporation in about April 1999 and have been responsible for the preparation of its financial statements from that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">' 
 

114 The occasion for the preparation by Mr Harris of accounts for Regis Towers for the year ended 30 June 2000 in 2002 would appear to have been the need for him to swear the affidavit of 28 August 2002 in respect of an application for security for costs then made by the defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings namely Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, Meriton Finance Pty Limited and Harry Londy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">115 It is clear that the amount of $345,000 said to represent a borrowing by Regis Towers from Wizard Home Loans had nothing to do with Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">116 The amount of $345,000 was borrowed by Mr and Mrs Pappas from Permanent Custodians Limited in its capacity as trustee for Wizard Home Loans on or about 7 May 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Mr and Mrs Pappas on-lent the amount in question to the bankrupt, who used it to discharge his indebtedness to Patricia Dawn Grierson from whom the bankrupt had borrowed $327,000 on or about 12 May 2000 upon the security of a further third party mortgage given by Mr and Mrs Pappas over their property known as 14 Birchgrove Road, Balmain, which he then used to repay his original borrowing of $327,000 from Howes &amp; Ors of 6 May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">117 By a deed made 5 August 2002 between Mr and Mrs Pappas, Regis Towers and the bankrupt and his then wife Popi Rose, Regis Towers granted to Mr and Mrs Pappas a first fixed and floating charge over the whole business and assets of Regis Towers to secure repayment of an amount of $355,000 agreed to be lent by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers, which the deed recorded as having already been advanced by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">118 The deed provided for the bankrupt and Popi Rose to guarantee the repayment of the loan and any outstanding interest to Mr and Mrs Pappas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">119 As it transpires no such loan was ever made by Mr and Mrs Pappas to Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">120 In these circumstances the Trustee responded to the Statement of Claim and Proxy Form claiming $483,970.21 lodged with him by Regis Towers by letter dated 29 March 2006 stating:
 
 ' Further Proof of Debt 
 
 You provided a CD containing copies of the company accounts in support of this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">My comments follow:

 The Trustee's Case 
 
123 The Trustee asserts that certain transfers of property by the bankrupt to other persons, which preceded his bankruptcy, are void against the Trustee in accordance with s 121(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The transfers in question are said to be:
 
 (a) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers, taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (b) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Caretaker-Management Agreement made on or about 17 August 1999 between The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 and Regis Towers taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (c) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under an agreement for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443 taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (d) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under an agreement for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 454 in Strata Plan No 58586 (which later became identified as Strata Plan No 58946) taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (e) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under an agreement for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 488 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369 taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (f) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under an agreement for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 489 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369 taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (g) A transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under an agreement for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 650 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369 taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act;
 (h) A transfer by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited of $218,750 by paying same to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited in late April 1999 in accordance with s 121(9)(a) of the Act (query a transfer by the bankrupt to Kerrie McInnes of $218,750 by the payment of such an amount by the bankrupt to her on 6 May 1999);
 (i) A transfer by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited of $257,814.51 by paying same to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 6 August 1999 in accordance with s 121(9)(a) of the Act;
 (j) A transfer by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited of $334,439.88 by the payment by the bankrupt of such an amount to 'Meriton Apartments' on 2 December 1999 in accordance with s 121(9)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">[the amount of $334,439.88 was originally erroneously expressed as $361,183.28 (it should have read $361,103.28) but $26,663.40 out of this payment was abandoned by the Trustee as constituting an alleged transfer that was void against him, being the amount paid by the bankrupt to 'Meriton Apartments' on 3 December 1999 in respect of the settlement of the purchase of Lot 501 in DP 61369 by the bankrupt and his former wife, Popi Rose].</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">

124 It is important to note that neither Kerrie McInnes nor Meriton Apartments Pty Limited has been made a party to the Trustee's cross-application notwithstanding that each of them may be significantly affected in the event that payments to them were found to be void transfers within the meaning of s 121(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">125 Dealing firstly with the alleged transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers, taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, the Trustee contends that:
 
 (a) On or about 20 April 1999 Regis Towers entered into the Head Agreement with Meriton Apartments Pty Limited;
 (b) The bankrupt did something that resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the beneficial promises under the Head Agreement, presumably the choses in action arising from the entry by Regis Towers into the Head Agreement ('the Head Agreement choses in action'); 
 (c) The Head Agreement choses in action did not previously exist; and
 (d) For the purposes of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act , the bankrupt is taken to have transferred the Head Agreement choses in action to Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">

126 The Trustee does not submit that the effect of a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt to another person being void against the Trustee in the deemed transferor's bankruptcy requires a finding that, in law, the deemed transfer never occurred, for such a finding would leave the person who became the owner of the property that did not previously exist unaffected by the avoidance of the deemed transfer and without any equitable obligations to transfer the newly created property to the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">127 The Trustee's case in respect of the Head Agreement choses in action is that they would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate within the meaning of s 121(1)(a) of the Act were it not for the transfer that was taken to have occurred in accordance s 121(9)(b) i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">had the bankrupt not done the something that resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Whilst the alternative provided for in s 121(1)(a) of the Act has been pleaded, it was not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">128 The Trustee submits that the bankrupt's main purpose in making the transfer, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">in doing the something that resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action, fell within s 121(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">However, it is not submitted that the evidence would allow a finding that the bankrupt's main purpose fell within s 121(1)(b), but for s 121(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">The Trustee contends that s 121(1)(b) is satisfied because it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the deemed transfer, the bankrupt was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">129 The Trustee submits that the alleged transfer of the Head Agreement choses in action which was taken to have occurred by virtue of s 121(9)(b) was not saved from avoidance by s 121(4) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">In the circumstances of an alleged deemed transfer of the Head Agreement choses in action, s 121(4) would require an evaluation of the consideration, if any, that Regis Towers gave for the rights created in its favour under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 and a determination as to whether such consideration was at least as valuable as the market value of the Head Agreement choses in action, a determination as to whether Regis Towers knew that the bankrupt's main purpose in doing the something that resulted in Regis Towers acquiring the rights created in its favour under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 was to prevent the Head Agreement choses in action from becoming divisible property amongst the bankrupt's creditors, or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division amongst the bankrupt's creditors and, a determination as to whether Regis Towers could or could not reasonably have inferred that as at 20 April 1999, the bankrupt was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">130 Were it to be found that a transfer was taken to have occurred by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers and that such transfer was void against the Trustee, consideration would also have to be given to what if any property had been acquired by any other person from Regis Towers, in respect of the rights created in favour of Regis Towers, in good faith and for at least the market value of such property (see s 121(8) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">131 In addition a determination would be required as to the value of any consideration that Regis Towers gave for the rights created in its favour under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 which the Trustee would be required to pay to Regis Towers in accordance with s 121(5) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Section 121 of the Act 
 
132 Section 121, as applicable to the facts of the present case, was inserted into the Act by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The former s 121 dealing with 'fraudulent dispositions' was repealed and replaced by a new s 121 entitled 'Transfers to Defeat Creditors'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The Explanatory Memorandum circulated by the authority of the then Attorney-General and Minister for Justice when the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was before the Senate included the following in respect of the changes which were being made:
 
 
 ' Repeal and substitution of sections 
 ... 
 
 
 84.2 There are three categories of transaction which the Act makes void against the trustee in bankruptcy, namely settlements of property (section 120), fraudulent dispositions (section 121) and preferences (section 122).</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Item 208 of the Bill proposes the replacement of existing sections 120 and 121, and some substantial modifications are proposed to section 122 to modernise and strengthen the law relating to the avoidance of antecedent transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">
 
 
 
 Undervalued transactions 
 ... 
 
 
 84.7 Proposed new section 120 makes the following transactions void against the trustee in bankruptcy: 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; any transfer of property that took place 2 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy of the transferor, where the transferee gave no consideration for the transfer or gave consideration less than the market value of the property transferred; 
 
 
 
 &#8226; a transfer of property which took place more than 2 years, but not more than 5 years before the commencement of the transferor's bankruptcy, where the transferee gave no consideration or less than market value consideration is void unless the transferee proves that at the time of the transfer, the transferor was not insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">
 
 
 
 84.8 It is important to note at this point that the term "transfer" is to be used in the new section 120, and that term will also be used in the new section 121 and the amended section 122.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The word transfer will have its ordinary meaning in the new and revised provisions, except to the extent that it is given an expanded definition by proposed subsections 120(7), 121(9) and 122(8), so that it encompasses a payment of money, or the doing of some act or thing which results in another person becoming the owner of property which did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">The Second Revised Edition of the Macquarie Dictionary defines among the meanings of transfer "1. to remove from 1 place, person etc to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Law to make over or convey ..." .</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">It will be seen that in ordinary parlance, the term transfer does not carry with it any connotation that any property which is transferred is intended to be retained permanently, or at all by the transferee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">This will make the new section 120 stricter than the present provision, because of the absence of the test of permanency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">
 ... 
 84.10 Another important change is that provided for in proposed subsection 120(7), whereby when a person does something which results in another person becoming the owner of property whether or not it previously existed, the person as a result of whose actions came into being is taken to have transferred the property to the person who owns it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Thus where a person creates an interest in property, for example by allowing a mortgage or charge to be created over it, the person will be taken to have transferred property, for the purposes of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Likewise, if Frank who subsequently became a bankrupt constructed a residence on a block of land owned by Eugenie, Frank would be taken to have transferred property to Eugenie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The transfer would be void against the trustee if the house was constructed within 2 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and Eugenie had either not paid Frank, or if Frank's work in constructing the residence was worth $300,000, but Eugenie had only paid him $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Another example might be a situation where 3 years before the commencement of her bankruptcy, Gertrude conferred a licence on Harold to use a trademark, or an Item the subject of a patent, where no licence to use the Item previously existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Gertrude would be taken to be transferring property to Harold, and if this was done for less than what might be expected to be the market value of the rights conferred by the licence, the transfer would be void, unless Harold could prove that Gertrude was not insolvent at the time of giving the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 84.13 The consideration given by a person for the transfer of property must be an amount which is equal to at least the market value of the property at the time of the transfer (see proposed paragraph 120(7)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The requirement is intended to overcome the decision of the High Court in Barton v Official Receiver [1986] HCA 44 ; (1986) 161 CLR 75 that a person who claims to be a purchaser of the property need not show that he or she has given fully adequate consideration for the transfer, but nevertheless must have given real and substantial consideration, and not consideration which is merely nominal, trivial or colourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The expression "market value" is intended to refer to the value of the property concerned if it were disposed of to an unrelated purchaser bidding in a market on an ordinary commercial basis for property of the kind disposed of, without any sort of discount or incentive for purchase being offered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The expression is not intended to include a situation where the property was being disposed of at a "fire sale", at discounted prices because of some immediate need on the part of the owner to liquidate his or her assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Of course, there may be differing opinions as to the precise market value of some property, for example house properties, where valuers or real estate agents may give kerbside valuations which spread over a range of monetary values.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">However, if the property was transferred for an amount less than the lowest amount in the range, the transfer would be a transfer at undervalue, for the purposes of the section.. 
 ... 
 84.17 Under the proposed test of insolvency, it will be relevant to consider contingent liabilities where there is a reasonable likelihood that they will become actual liabilities giving rise to a present obligation to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">
 ... 
 85.19 Another feature of the proposed test of-insolvency (sic) is that it requires a consideration of the debtor's income, as well as asset position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Income in this context refers to income according to ordinary usages and concepts, rather than that term as specially defined for the purposes of the compulsory income contribution regime established by Division 4B of Part VI of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">A person will be insolvent at a particular time if his or her income, as well as assets, are insufficient to meet his or her liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Absence of an income flow may cause a temporary lack of liquidity, of the kind spoken of by Barwick CJ in Sandell v Porter , referred to earlier, which is not of itself indicative of insolvency, but in many instances a lack of cash flow will for all intents and purposes prevent a debtor from readily meeting his or her liabilities as and when they become due, and may make it necessary for a person to arrange to dispose of some part of his or her assets very quickly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">For this reason, lack of liquidity because of absence of income flow should be a factor to be taken into account in determining insolvency, because income does form part of the moneys and assets a debtor may have at his or her disposal to pay debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">
 ... 
 Transfers to defeat creditors 
 
 84.24 Section 121 of the Act makes a disposition of property made with intent to defraud creditors void against the trustee in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The proposed new provision will change the tenor of the provision, and instead of focussing on the notion of fraud, is concerned with a person's purpose of delaying the satisfaction of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">
 
 84.25 Under proposed subsection 121(1), a transfer of property is void if: 
 
 &#8226; the property concerned would probably have become part of the bankrupt estate; and 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was to prevent the property from becoming divisible, or to hinder or delay the division of the property among the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">
 
 
 
 The transferor is taken to have the purpose of preventing creditors from having recourse to the property, or delaying or hindering the process of recovering the property if it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become insolvent, that is, the transferor's property and income were, or were about to become, insufficient to meet the transferor's liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">
 ... 
 84.28 Where the transferee has given consideration for the transfer the trustee of the bankruptcy must pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any consideration that the transferee gave for a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">
 
 84.29 Other features the new section 121 will have in common with section 120 are that a transfer of property will be taken to have occurred where a person does something which results in another person becoming the owner of property which did not previously exist, and also, a person who acquires the property from the transferee for consideration at least equal to the market value of the property obtains good title to it as against the trustee (proposed subsections 121(8) and (9)).</sentence>

 ...' 

133 In Peldan v Anderson ('Peldan') [2006] HCA 48 ; (2006) 229 ALR 432 the High Court had to consider the application of s 121 to the severance of a joint tenancy in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">On 11 September 2003 Mr Pinna, who later became a bankrupt, executed a transfer to himself of a 'one-half interest in fee simple' in the matrimonial home which was registered in the names of Mr and Mrs Pinna as joint tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">At the time in question Mr Pinna was approximately 80 years of age and Mrs Pinna approximately 78 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The relevant instrument was registered on 5 November 2003 with the consequence that Mr and Mrs Pinna became tenants in common in undivided one half shares in respect of the property at Carindale which they had originally acquired in 1995 as joint tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">134 As it transpires Mrs Pinna died on 12 January 2004, some three months before a sequestration order was made against the estate of Mr Pinna.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">135 The question which arose for consideration was whether Mrs Pinna's interest in the property would probably have become part of Mr Pinna's bankrupt estate within the meaning of s 121(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">136 In relation to s 121(9)(b), the bench, comprising Gummow ACJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Crennan JJ, said at [23]-[28]:
 
 '[23] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The section impugns transactions which answer the description of a "transfer of property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">This expression will bear its ordinary meaning, save to the extent that this is expanded by s 121(9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The term "transfer of property" also appears in s 120 ("Undervalued transactions") and s 122 ("Avoidance of preferences").</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Further, these sections contain definitional provisions which were introduced by the 1996 Act and are in identical terms to s 121(9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">
 
 [24] Paragraph (b) of s 121(9) provides that A "is taken" to have transferred to B property that "did not previously exist" if A "does something" which results in B becoming the owner of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Thus, par (b) expands the concepts at the heart of s 121 beyond their natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">It is expressed in similar terms to the former s 160M(6) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), which was the subject of the litigation in Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation .</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Section 160M(6) consistently attracted the description "obscure".</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">That same adjective also appropriately describes par (b) of s 121(9) of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">
 
 [25] It is important to recall that "property" for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act must be understood as including "any estate, interest or profit, whether present or future, vested or contingent, arising out of or incident to" real or personal property of any description (s 5(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">As noted above, par (b) of s 121(9) operates to treat person A, who did something which resulted in person B becoming the owner of property that did not "previously" exist, as having transferred "the property" to B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">In its natural sense, the word "previously" indicates that the property did not exist prior to the act of A which results in B becoming the owner of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">The act of A which produces the result that B becomes the owner of that property is to be regarded as the "transfer of property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Upon an ordinary reading, the corollary of this is that the property that did not previously exist is taken to be the "transferred property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">
 
 [26] As remarked earlier in these reasons, provisions in the terms of s 121(9) appeared at the same time as s 120(7) and s 122(8) of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It is to be expected that the sub-section has the same meaning in each provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">In the Explanatory Memorandum to the House of Representatives upon the Bill for the 1996 Act, it was said at [84.10] of the inclusion of the provision in the undervalued transactions provision (s 120) that: 
 
 
 
 "where a person creates an interest in property, for example by allowing a mortgage or charge to be created over it, the person will be taken to have transferred property, for the purposes of the section".</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">
 
 
 
 Other examples were given, including the conferral of a trademark or patent licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Further instances would include the grant of a lease over freehold property and a declaration of a trust over property vested in the "transferor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">In all of these cases, the same act both creates the property in question and vests it in the other person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">
 
 [27] In other cases to which the sub-section would apply, the creation of property will occur at a later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Instances of this relate primarily to the diversion of future property (necessarily constituting property that did not previously exist) from coming into the hands of the person who later becomes bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">This may occur by the assignment, whether absolutely or by way of charge, of property such as future income, royalties yet to be earned, and damages which may be recovered in pending litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">(Consideration is required for the assignment to be effective, but that issue is dealt with by s 121(4) of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">) In such cases, the assignment operates immediately upon acquisition by the assignor and vests the property in the assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">
 
 [28] However, in all these cases (and it is not suggested that the examples are exhaustive), the property that did not previously exist is "carved out" of "property" which is held, or which comes to be held, by the person who later becomes bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">' [footnotes omitted]
 

137 The Court proceeded to point out that it was only in a loose sense that one could say that the property which did not previously exist, namely Mrs Pinna's undivided one half interest as a tenant in common had been 'carved out' of any property of Mr Pinna.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">At [29] their Honours said:
 
 'What was "carved out", in a loose sense, from both Mr Pinna's and Mrs Pinna's prior interest as joint tenants was the right of survivorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">' 
 

138 Notwithstanding that the property that did not previously exist, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Mrs Pinna's undivided one half interest as a tenant in common in the Carindale property, could not be said to have been carved out of any property of Mr Pinna, nevertheless the Court found that Mr Pinna should be taken to have transferred such property to Mrs Pinna within the meaning of s 121(9)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">At [30] their Honours said:
 
 '[30] ... upon registration of the transfer executed by Mr Pinna pursuant to s 59(1) of the Land Title Act , Mrs Pinna became "the owner of property that did not previously exist".</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">She acquired an interest as tenant in common in the Carindale property whereas previously she had held an interest as joint tenant in the Carindale property (which included the right of survivorship).</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">That interest as joint tenant was transformed into, or extinguished and replaced by, the interest as tenant in common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Accordingly, the terms of par (b) of s 121(9) were met because, by Mr Pinna registering the transfer unilaterally severing the joint tenancy, he did something by dint of which he was taken to have transferred the interest as tenant in common to Mrs Pinna.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">' 
 

139 It follows that it may be found that a person such as the bankrupt in the instant case may be taken to have transferred property that did not previously exist to another person if it could be said that the bankrupt has done something by dint of which or which produces the result that ('results in') the other person has become the owner of such property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">140 Assuming for the moment that the bankrupt is to be taken to have transferred to Regis Towers the rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, one has to then determine the manner in which s 121 operates upon the relevant 'transfer of property'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">141 As the Court said in Peldan there is an apparent conundrum (see [34]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Section 121(1)(a) of the Act presupposes that there was no transfer and asks what would have happened to 'the property' in that situation (see [33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">At [34] their Honours said:
 
 '[34] ... if the act which is taken to have transferred the property did not occur, the "property that did not previously exist" ex hypothesi would never have come into existence, and so could never "probably have become" part of the bankrupt's estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">...' 
 

142 Section 121(1)(a) assumes that the transferred property was, prior to the relevant transfer, capable as a matter of fact of becoming part of the bankrupt estate (see Peldan at [35]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">143 After referring to the textual and conceptual difficulties affecting s 121(9)(b) which manifest a failure by the draftsman adequately to grapple with the conceptual nature of the elements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of s 121(1) and their interaction (see Peldan at [35]), the Court asked the question at [39]:
 
 '... is it possible properly to resolve the contrariety identified ... and render sub-ss (1) and (9) of s 121 capable of sensible concomitant operation in those ... cases ... where there is a direct "carve-out" of property?</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">May the words "the property" in the opening words of par (a) of s 121(1) be construed as referring to something other than "the property that did not previously exist"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">...' 
 

144 The Court proceeded to answer its own rhetorical question at [44] as follows:
 
 '[44] Where s 121(9)(b) is relied upon, the phrase "the property" in the opening words of s 121(1)(a) should be construed as signifying "the property in the hands of the transferor prior to the act which is taken to be the transfer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">This removes from the operation of s 121(1)(a) the assumption that it is existing property which is being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">It involves treating the words "the property" in s 121(1)(a) in a special sense to give to s 121(1) an extended operation as required by s 121(9)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">' 
 

145 At [45] the Court emphasised that s 121(9)(b) expressly stated that the property deemed to have been transferred was the 'property that did not previously exist'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">146 Accordingly, the Court considered that s 121(1)(a) should be read, in the context of a deemed transfer under s 121(9)(b), as follows:
 
 
 
 '121(1) A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the property [in the hands of the transferor prior to the act taken to be the transfer] would probably have become part of the transferor's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property [in the hands of the transferee after the act taken to be the transfer] had not been [taken to have been] transferred; ...' 
 
 
 
 
 
 

147 Significantly, the Court considered that the relevant focus should not be upon whether the property that did not previously exist would have become part of the transferor's estate in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">At [46] their Honours said:
 
 '[46] The effect of the acceptable construction [that referred to above] is to shift the emphasis of the inquiry in s 121(1)(a), and to focus not upon whether the "transferred property" would have become part of the transferor's estate in bankruptcy, but upon whether that result would have obtained in respect of the transferor's "property" (as defined in s 5(1)) out of which the newly created property has been "carved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">' 
 

148 Adopting this approach the Court found in Peldan that s 121(1)(a) required attention to be given to what would probably have happened to Mr Pinna's interest as a joint tenant in the Carindale property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Having found that that interest could never have become part of Mr Pinna's bankrupt estate, the Court concluded that the trustees of his bankrupt estate would have no claim to the whole of the proceeds of sale of the Carindale property as they had sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">(See Peldan at [48].</sentence>

 Consideration of the Trustee's case 
 
149 Regis Towers submits that in presenting his case the Trustee has skated over the events leading up to 20 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">This submission seems to me to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">150 In paragraphs 17 --- 36 of his affidavit, sworn 28 August 2006, the bankrupt gave evidence of his 'Arrangements with Kerrie McInnes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Amongst other things he gave evidence in paragraph 17 of a conversation with Mr Stewart on or about Saturday 17 April 1999 as follows:
 
 
 Bankrupt: 'I have really been stuffed around by Harry [referring to Mr Londy] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">I bought all these apartments in the Regis Towers complex and now I can't use them as serviced apartments as he said I could because Meriton are selling caretaker/management rights which contain exclusivity provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">' 
 Stewart: 'You know John, that sounds like the type of business my mother-in-law is looking to buy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">She's cashed up at the moment and looking for real estate businesses to purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Perhaps we could have a look at Regis Towers?</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">
 Bankrupt: 'Look mate, I can't buy the rights as I'm out of money from having acquired all these other units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">' 
 Stewart: 'Can you show us what's involved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">' 
 Bankrupt: 'Well you know Londy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Why not call Londy direct and go and have a look?</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">' 
 

151 The bankrupt proceeded to depose to a further conversation with Mr Stewart on the afternoon of Monday 19 April 1999 or the morning of Tuesday 20 April 1999 in paragraph 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">According to the bankrupt a conversation took place to the following effect:
 
 
 Stewart: 'Kerrie's accountant has given everything the thumbs up so it's okay to go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">I propose to incorporate a company to buy this business and we would like you in the deal as you know about it already.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Kerrie would like a partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">' 
 

 Bankrupt: 'Look I've got no money so I could put nothing into the deal at the moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">' 
 
 Stewart: 'When could you put any money in?</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">' 
 
 
 Bankrupt: 'Look, no sooner than when I can complete the development at Rozelle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">The development should be finished in about September'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">
 Stewart: 'Look, Kerrie agrees to put all the money in now and you can put your half share in later in September when you finish at Rozelle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">' 
 

152 The bankrupt's evidence is that a one page document recording the terms of the bankrupt's arrangement with Kerrie McInnes was prepared by Mr Stewart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">However, the bankrupt has been unable to locate that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">There is no evidence as to its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">153 In paragraph 21 of his affidavit the bankrupt deposed to Mr Stewart being the moving party in relation to the acquisition of the shelf company which became Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">154 In the course of his evidence in chief the bankrupt was asked why he wanted Regis Towers to enter into the Head Agreement with Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 20 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">His response was:
 
 'Well, the company was Kerrie McInnes and myself who were in discussions that I had with McInnes and a Mr Craig Stuart (sic) [Mr C K Stewart] ... At that time we were going to be partners in the acquisition of the caretaker manager rights, if you like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">It was suggested to me by Mr Stuart (sic) that perhaps I would want to incorporate a company to give effect to the partnership or trade, the partnership by virtue of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">I gave instructions that that was okay to have the company incorporate for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">' 
 

155 When asked what the bankrupt intended the company to do in terms of trade, the bankrupt responded:
 
 'Well, to fulfil the duties mainly of the caretaker agreement or the arrangements in respect of Regis Towers complex and also the management of units predominantly just in that complex was the idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">' 
 

156 Whilst the complete answer to the Trustee's case in respect of the transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, lies in s 121(1)(a) as construed by the High Court in Peldan , it is appropriate to observe that the bankrupt did not relevantly do something which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action, being property that did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">His actions may, just like his getting out of bed on the morning of 20 April 1999, have contributed to Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action, but they did not result in Regis Towers becoming their owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">157 For the doing of something by a person to result in another person becoming the owner of property within the meaning of s 121(9)(b) more is required than a mere link between the doing of the something and the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The doing of the something must bring about the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">The outcome has to arise as an effect of the relevant action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">158 To use the High Court's expressions in Peldan at [25] the doing of something has to be the act which 'produces the result' or, as indicated at [30], one must be able to say that 'by dint of' the doing of the something , the other person became the owner of the property that did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">159 Turning to the events of 20 April 1999 the relevant something which the bankrupt did in relation to the making of the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers was to agree with Kerrie McInnes, as a de facto director of Regis Towers within the meaning of s 9 of the Corporations Act (or with Kerrie McInnes, Craig Stewart and Popi Rose as de facto directors), that Regis Towers should enter into the Head Agreement, and, to witness, together with Kerrie McInnes, the affixing of the common seal of Regis Towers (then known as Cesscut Pty Limited) to the Head Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">160 Other things which led to Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action were the concurrence of Kerrie McInnes (or of Kerrie McInnes, Craig Stewart and Popi Rose) in the action taken by Regis Towers, the payment by Kerrie McInnes on behalf of Regis Towers of the deposit of $131,250 due to be paid by Regis Towers to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under the Head Agreement (see clause 3.1(a)) and the execution of the Head Agreement by Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">What is clear is that neither Regis Towers nor the bankrupt had the financial capacity, independently of the assistance provided by Kerrie McInnes, to enter into an agreement with Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 20 April 1999 in the terms of the Head Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">161 It follows that the bankrupt did not relevantly do something which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action that did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Accordingly, the bankrupt was not taken to have transferred the Head Agreement choses of action to Regis Towers within the meaning of s 121(9)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">162 If, contrary to my opinion, the bankrupt was taken to have transferred the Head Agreement choses in action to Regis Towers then such transfer was not void against the Trustee because there was no property in the hands of the bankrupt , prior to the bankrupt doing the something, taken to be the transfer, which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action that did not previously exist, which would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the Head Agreement choses in action had not been taken to have been transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">163 Apart from the foregoing findings, which are adverse to the Trustee's case in respect of the Head Agreement choses in action, I do not consider that it could reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, as at 20 April 1999, the bankrupt was or was about to become insolvent in accordance with the abovementioned principles, nor do I consider that it could reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances, at any other relevant time in 1999, that the bankrupt was or was about to become insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">I will amplify my reasoning in this regard later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">164 One other matter which I propose to deal with in relation to the claimed avoidance against the Trustee of the transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers and taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, is the question of whether or not, in the event that the transfer was found to be void, the Trustee would be obliged under s 121(5) of the Act to pay to Regis Towers an amount equal to the value of the consideration that Regis Towers gave for the Head Agreement choses in action, being the relevant property that did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">In my opinion, it is clear that the Trustee would have to pay Regis Towers an amount equal to the value of Regis Towers' promise under clause 3.1 of the Head Agreement to pay Meriton Apartments the sum of $1,750,000 in the manner indicated in clause 3.1 of the Head Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">I do not accept the Trustee's submission that the only relevant consideration under s 121(5) of the Act is that moving from Regis Towers which may be payable to the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Whilst it is unnecessary, for present purposes, to undertake a valuation of the relevant consideration, there would seem to be compelling reasons for concluding that the value of the relevant consideration was, in the circumstances of this case, $1,750,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">165 Turning now to the alleged transfer by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the Caretaker-Management Agreement made on or about 17 August 1999 between The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 and Regis Towers, taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, it may be noted that this is the aspect of the case to which the Trustee under its amended pleading gives the greatest emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">However, the Trustee's case fails for substantially similar reasons to those set out above in respect of the Head Agreement choses in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">166 The Trustee contends that the bankrupt did something that resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the beneficial promises under the Caretaker-Management Agreement, presumably the choses in action arising from the entry by Regis Towers into the Caretaker-Management Agreement ('the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action').</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">167 Once again, it may be observed that the bankrupt did not relevantly do something which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action, being property that did not previously exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">His actions may, just like his getting out of bed on the morning of 17 August 1999, have contributed to Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action, but they did not result in Regis Towers becoming their owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">168 The relevant something which the bankrupt did in relation to the making of the Caretaker-Management Agreement between the Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 and Regis Towers was, as the company's sole director at the time, to cause Regis Towers to enter into the Caretaker-Management Agreement and, to witness the affixing of the common seal of Regis Towers to that agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">169 However, the other thing which led to Regis Tower becoming the owner of the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action was the execution of the Caretaker-Management Agreement by The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 on 6 August 1999 and the making of the agreement thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">What is clear is that, given Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's standing as the original owner of all of the lots in the Strata Plans comprising the Strata Scheme, Meriton Apartments Pty Limited's standing as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' and Meriton Apartments Pty Limited's obligations under clause 2.1(c) of the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999 to cause The Owners Corporation to 'Resolve to enter into the Caretaker-Manager Agreement with the Caretaker [Regis Towers] and to execute such agreements', the primary reason for The Owners --- Strata Plan No 56443 entering into the Caretaker-Management Agreement with Regis Towers was to enable Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to fulfil its obligations to Regis Towers under the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">170 The bankrupt should not be taken to have transferred the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action to Regis Towers within the meaning of s 121(9)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">171 If, contrary to my opinion, the bankrupt was taken to have transferred the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action to Regis Towers then such transfer was not void against the Trustee because there was no property in the hands of the bankrupt , prior to the bankrupt doing the something, taken to be the transfer, which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action that did not previously exist, which would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the Caretaker-Management Agreement choses in action had not been taken to have been transferred.</sentence>

<sentence id="s589">In my opinion, it is clear that the Trustee would have to pay Regis Towers an amount equal to the value of Regis Towers' promises to perform its caretaker, cleaning and concierge duties in a conscientious, expeditious and workmanlike manner during the term of the agreement as required by clause 1 of the Caretaker-Management Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Once again, I do not accept the Trustee's submission that the only relevant consideration under s 121(5) of the Act is that moving from Regis Towers which may directly benefit the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to undertake a valuation of the relevant consideration, but plainly it would be substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">174 Turning now to the alleged transfers by the bankrupt to Regis Towers of rights created in favour of Regis Towers under the several agreements for purchase made on or about 20 April 1999 between Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and Regis Towers for the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 149 in Strata Plan No 56443, Lot 454 in Strata Plan No 58946 (earlier identified as 58586), Lot 488 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369, Lot 489 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369 and Lot 650 in the strata plan which later became Strata Plan No 61369, taken to have occurred in accordance with s 121(9)(b) of the Act, the Trustee's case fails, once again, for substantially similar reasons to those set out above in respect of the Head Agreement choses in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">175 The Trustee contends that in the case of each agreement for purchase the bankrupt did something that resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the relevant beneficial promises under such agreements, presumably the choses in action arising from the entry by Regis Towers into such agreements (collectively 'the agreements for purchase choses in action').</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">176 It may again be observed that the bankrupt did not in relation to any of the agreements for purchase relevantly do something which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the agreements for purchase choses in action or any of them, being property that did not previously exist.</sentence>

<sentence id="s609">Consideration of the Trustee's alternative case in respect of the payments 
 
185 As indicated above the bankrupt made certain payments in 1999 in respect of which the Trustee seeks relief under s 121 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">186 By virtue of s 121(9)(a) of the Act, a payment of money is within the meaning of 'transfer of property' for the purposes of s 121.</sentence>

 '(1) A transfer of property [payment of money] by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if:

188 The payments made by the bankrupt referred to at [78] --- [96] above were as follows:

189 Whilst one might have expected the balance of the settlement monies in respect of the purchase of Lots 488, 489 and 650 by Regis Towers, which were covered by the $334,439.88, to have been paid to Meriton Property Management Pty Limited as the relevant vendor, the standard form of contract for the development would appear to have included a clause 32.1 whereby Meriton Property Management Pty Limited directed the payment of the balance of purchase monies to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">In relation to the purchase of Lot 650 clause 32.1 of the contract provided:

190 The Trustee's case in respect of an alleged payment of $218,750 by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited in late April 1999 must fail.</sentence>

<sentence id="s615">191 The evidence establishes that on or about 20 April 1999 Kerrie McInnes paid $218,750 to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as indicated above to meet all the deposit obligations of Regis Towers under the several contracts entered into by Regis Towers on 20 April 1999 with Meriton Property Management Pty Limited and/or Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">There is no suggestion that Regis Towers agreed to allot shares in its capital to Kerrie McInnes for the money so paid nor is there any suggestion that Kerrie McInnes intended to give the money to Regis Towers.</sentence>

<sentence id="s618">193 Whilst there is some evidence that a 'stop payment' was placed or to be placed on Ms McInnes' cheques, it is clear that the cheques were ultimately met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">194 When Ms McInnes and Mr Stewart withdrew from the enterprise on or about 6 May 1999 and the bankrupt proceeded to pay $218,750 to Ms McInnes as indicated above, the effect of the payment was for the bankrupt to take an assignment of Regis Towers' indebtedness to Ms McInnes for a like amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">195 No claim is made by the Trustee that the payment of $218,750 by the bankrupt to Ms McInnes on or about 6 May 1999 constituted a transfer of property which was void against the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Even if such a claim had been made, and assuming that Ms McInnes had been made a party to the proceedings, it would, in my opinion, fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">196 The Court could not conclude that the monies the subject of the payment would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the payment had not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">197 The bankrupt did not become bankrupt until 21 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">The earliest possible date for the commencement of his bankruptcy under s 115(2) of the Act, would, in the circumstances, have been 21 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">The payment in question was made five and a half years before that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">198 If the payment to Ms McInnes had not been made, the likelihood is that the monies the subject of the payment would have been used to repay the borrowing made by the bankrupt from Howes &amp; Ors, or otherwise expended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">199 Apart from the above consideration, I could not reasonably infer from all the circumstances that, as at 6 May 1999, the bankrupt was or was about to become insolvent in accordance with the relevant principles referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">200 In addition, if the payment of $218,750 by the bankrupt to Ms McInnes were found to be void against the Trustee, the Trustee would be required, under s 121(5) of the Act, to pay to Ms McInnes an amount equal to the value of the consideration given by her for the payment i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">the value of the assignment by her to the bankrupt of her right to be repaid the amount of $218,750 lent by her to Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Without attempting to value that consideration, it is difficult to contemplate that, as at 6 May 1999 it would have been less than $218,750.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">201 This leaves for consideration the payments made by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 6 August 1999 and 2 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">Before addressing the operation of s 121 of the Act in relation to those payments, it is appropriate to expand on the observations made above that it could not reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that at any relevant time in 1999, the bankrupt was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">Insolvency 
 
202 Whilst a person may be unable to pay all the person's debts as and when they become due and payable and, accordingly, be insolvent within the meaning of the Act or, may find himself or herself in circumstances where he or she is about to become insolvent within the meaning of s 121(2) of the Act, it would be unusual in the extreme for such a person to be able to avoid bankruptcy for another five years, no sequestration order being made in respect of his or her estate and no necessity arising for the person to present a debtor's petition against himself or herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">203 The possibility could always exist that such a person might, when about to become insolvent, enjoy a windfall gain which might have the effect of staving off the fateful day for another five years or so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Having said that, I do not consider that in the circumstances of the present case, one can dismiss as irrelevant the long delay between the bankrupt's alleged insolvency in 1999 and his ultimate bankruptcy in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">204 It is significant, as submitted by Regis Towers, that there is no evidence of any cheques having been drawn by the bankrupt which were dishonoured on presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">There is no evidence of any claims having been made for unpaid taxation and there is no evidence of any notices having been served on the bankrupt under s 57(2)(b) of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">205 Whilst the bankrupt may, on or about 17 April 1999 have been 'out of money', it must be observed that the reason for him finding himself in such a position was that he had just 'acquired all these other units', a reference, no doubt, to the acquisition by himself or by himself and his then wife, Popi Rose, of Lots 417, 582, 587, 567, 471, 564, 505, 561, 565, 501 and 459 in the various strata plans forming part of the strata scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">206 The purchases by the bankrupt or by the bankrupt and his wife all proceeded to settlement between July and December 1999 without default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">The purchase prices paid by them totalled, as indicated above, $4,603,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">207 The bankrupt opened his Cash Management Call Account at the Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets branch of Commonwealth Bank of Australia on 13 July 1999 with a deposit of $491,232.92.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">That account had a credit balance of $45,765.55 as at 6 September 1999, a credit balance of $422,287.27 as at 16 November 1999, a credit balance of $58,374.79 as at 7 December 1999 and a credit balance of $18,553.29 as at 24 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">208 In support of his case for a finding of insolvency or approaching insolvency in 1999 the Trustee relies upon a balance sheet for the bankrupt prepared by Mr Harris in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">This balance sheet showed total assets as at 30 June 1999 of $2,364,920.85 and total liabilities of $2,830,505.30, indicating a deficiency of assets over liabilities of $465,584.45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">The comparable figures as at 30 June 2000 were total assets of $7,294,651.23 and total liabilities of $7,749,466.70, indicating a deficiency of assets over liabilities of $454,815.47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">However, the balance sheets appear to have been prepared on an historical cost basis with the consequence that none of the unrealised capital gains, reflected in the post acquisition valuations of numerous lots in the strata scheme, were taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">209 The Trustee also relied upon an understatement in the balance sheet of the bankrupt's indebtedness as at 30 June 1999 to Howes &amp; Ors, which should have been recorded at $327,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">In the balance sheet it was shown as an indebtedness to Nugent Wallam (sic) &amp; Carter in the sum of $103,731.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Nugent Wallman &amp; Carter were the solicitors for Howes &amp; Ors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">The Trustee's observation in respect of the understatement of the liability seems to be correct, but that does not relevantly establish insolvency on the part of the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">210 When Mr Harris prepared the balance sheets for the bankrupt, he also prepared two detailed profit and loss statements for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">For the year ended 30 June 1999, the year in which the bankrupt effectively gave up practising as a solicitor and established himself as a real estate investor and property manager, one profit and loss statement showed a loss of $68,301.50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">The other profit and loss statement showed a loss of $83,041.18 in respect of the bankrupt's property which he was developing at number 1, 722 Darling Street, Rozelle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">The comparable profit and loss statements for the year ended 30 June 2000 showed a profit of $269,567.00 and a loss of $93,650.70.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">211 The bankrupt's 1999 tax return showed a net loss of $151,171 and his 2000 return showed a net profit of $175,917.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">Whilst there has been some conjecture as to whether the copy tax returns, to which I have referred, reflect the income of the bankrupt as returned, I am satisfied that the returns were in fact copies of those that were lodged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">212 Other matters upon which the Trustee relied included defaults by the bankrupt in meeting certain demands upon him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">213 On 13 May 1999 Leichhardt Municipal Council instituted proceedings against the bankrupt in the Sutherland Local Court for non payment of rates and charges due and owing as at 18 March 1999 in respect of the property known as 1/724 Darling Street, Rozelle, in the sum of $22,605.15 plus costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">On the same day another action was commenced by the Council against the bankrupt for non payment of a 's 94 Open Space Contribution in respect of Development Application number 436/95' in the sum of $20,888 plus costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">There is no evidence that either of these matters proceeded to judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">214 There is evidence that a series of letters were written by Suncorp-Metway Limited to the bankrupt in April, June, July and September 1999 and January 2000 drawing his attention to arrears in respect of minimum monthly payments due under a loan from that company to the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">The amounts claimed as due or overdue in seven separate letters varied from a high of $2,767 to a low of $607.95.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">215 On 5 April 2005 G B Fernie &amp; Co Solicitors of 301 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, a building adjacent to the Castlereagh Street tower, submitted a memorandum of fees to Emanuel (sic) Triantafilis, the bankrupt's father, for $500 inclusive of GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">That memorandum of fees recorded that it had already been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">The description of the work to which the memorandum related was 'To our professional fees of obtaining instructions from you, drafting and filing Statement of Claim, Confession and entering Judgment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Mr Triantafilis's address was shown as 8/13 Harriette Street, Neutral Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">At the time Mr Triantafilis was living in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">216 The bankrupt changed his name from Triantafilis, which apparently means rose in Greek, to Rose many years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">G B Fernie &amp; Co in fact drafted a Statement of Liquidated Claim for proceedings to be instituted by Mr Triantafilis against his son, the bankrupt, claiming $750,000 although in the Statement of Claim this was recorded as a claim for $500,000 plus interest up to judgment and costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">The cause of action pleaded was an alleged failure by the bankrupt to account to his father for the proceeds of sale of a property known as 5 Quirk Street, Rozelle, said to have been sold by the bankrupt, exercising a power of attorney on behalf of his father, in September 1994, and for which he failed to account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">At the same time as G B Fernie &amp; Co drafted the Statement of Claim they also drafted a Statement of Confession for the bankrupt to sign and verify on 8 April 2005, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">three days after the date of G B Fernie &amp; Co's memorandum of fees, together with a draft affidavit for Mr Triantafilis to swear on 8 April 2005 in support of an application for a garnishee order against the bankrupt and also a draft garnishee order in respect of monies held by the bankrupt in an account with Laiki Bank Australia Limited, number 309682.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">217 I am not prepared to accept that these documents demonstrate any genuine indebtedness of the bankrupt to his father in 1999 or that, if there was an indebtedness, any claim had been made for payment of the monies in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">There is no evidence that the monies were due in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">The other payments 
 
218 Returning now to the payments made by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 6 August 1999 and 2 December 1999, the Trustee's case in respect of each such payment must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">219 I am not satisfied that the monies the subject of the payment on or about 6 August 1999 would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the payment had not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">220 Furthermore I am not satisfied that the monies the subject of the payment made on or about 2 December 1999 would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the payment had not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">221 If the payment of $257,814.51 had not been made on or about 6 August 1999, the likelihood is that the monies the subject of the payment would have been used to repay part of the borrowing made by the bankrupt and his brother on the security of the Darling Street, Rozelle property or otherwise expended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">Similarly, the likelihood is that the monies the subject of the payment of $334,439.88 on or about 2 December 1999 would have been used to repay indebtedness or otherwise expended long before December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">222 Apart from the above consideration, I could not reasonably infer from all the circumstances that as at 6 August 1999 or 2 December 1999, the bankrupt was or was about to become insolvent in accordance with the principles referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">223 There is the further question in relation to the payments made to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on or about 6 August 1999 and on or about 2 December 1999 as to what, if any, amounts the Trustee would have to pay, representing the value of the consideration that was given for the payments, were they to be found to be void against the Trustee, in accordance with s 121(5) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">224 If the payment of $257,814.51 by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited was found to be void against the Trustee, the Trustee would be required under s 121(5) of the Act to pay to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited an amount equal to the value of the consideration given by Meriton Apartments Pty Limited for such payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">The relevant consideration would be an implied promise by Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to release Regis Towers from its obligation under the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999 to itself pay such an amount to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">It is unnecessary to undertake a valuation of such consideration, but prima facie it would be unlikely that its value would be less than $275,814.51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">225 As for the payment of $334,439.88 by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, $75,114.15 represented monies paid to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' in respect of the settlement of the purchases by Regis Towers of Lots 488 and 489 in Strata Plan No 61369.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">The balance of $259,325.73 included an amount paid to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' in respect of the settlement of the purchase by Regis Towers of Lot 650 in Strata Plan No 61369 and an amount due to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to fulfil the balance of Regis Towers' obligations to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited under the Head Agreement made 20 April 1999 between Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and Regis Towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">226 If the payment of those amounts or any of them were found to be void against the Trustee, the Trustee would be required under s 121(5) of the Act to pay to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and/or Meriton Property Management Pty Limited amounts equal to the value of the consideration given by them for such payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">The relevant consideration would be an implied promise by Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to release Regis Towers from its obligation under the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999 to itself pay the relevant amount to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and an implied promise by Meriton Property Management Pty Limited to release Regis Towers from its obligation under the three agreements for purchase of Lots 488, 489 and 650 to itself pay the relevant amounts to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">It is unnecessary to undertake a valuation of such consideration, but prima facie the total would be unlikely to have a value less than $334,439.88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">227 In the foregoing circumstances, it follows that the Trustee's Second Further Amended Cross Application filed in Court on 17 October 2006 fails in respect of prayers for relief 8 and 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Accordingly, the Second Further Amended Cross Application in proceeding No NSD 641 of 2006 should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">The appeal against the Trustee's rejection of Regis Towers' proof of debt 
 
228 Two matters need to be addressed, firstly whether the Court should extend the time within which the application for review of the Trustee's decision may be brought under s 104(3) of the Act and, secondly, whether the decision should be confirmed, reversed or varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">229 The decision of the Trustee on Regis Towers' proof of debt was recorded in his notice of rejection dated 23 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">In the circumstances, it seems to me that the 21 day period prescribed in s 104(3) for Regis Towers' application for review to be brought expired on Friday 14 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">As indicated above, the application for review was not filed until 29 August 2006 but, in the meantime, an application had been filed in the form of a 'Second Cross Application' in proceeding number NSD 641 of 2006 on Monday 17 July 2006, which, following the institution of NSD 1657 of 2006, Regis Towers is no longer pressing, in which similar relief was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">230 In these circumstances, the failure to file the application for review within the prescribed time should be viewed de minimis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">No relevant prejudice having been caused, the time within which the application for review may be brought should be extended nunc pro tunc to 29 August 2006 so that the application may be taken to have been brought within time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">231 As to the application for review itself, the administrator conceded 'that there weren't proper books and records kept in relation to the company (referring to Regis Towers)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">Indeed, he reported this deficiency to both the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and also Regis Towers' creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">In the circumstances, the evidentiary value of Regis Towers' books is significantly eroded (cf s 1305 of the Corporations Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">232 Mr Harris' evidence in respect of the making of the journal entries affecting the bankrupt's directors' loan account as at 30 June 2000 does not allow a finding to be made that those entries were reliable or, for that matter, authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">I accept the bankrupt's evidence that he probably only saw the directors' loan account record, including the debit entry of $1,198,969.72, recently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">He entertained the possibility that he may have seen 'some other closely resembling form on another occasion', but I am unable to make a finding that he did see any earlier version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">233 The administrator has worked assiduously to demonstrate that one can properly get to the 30 June 2000 starting point of a debit balance in the bankrupt's loan account with Regis Towers of $7,875.46 by means other than the ledger account figures thrown up by Mr Harris when he prepared accounts for Regis Towers for the year ended 30 June 2000 in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">The problem is that, to get to the $7,875.46 figure, as he sought to do in his final submissions of 18 October 2006, the administrator had to invite the Court to find that the monies borrowed by the bankrupt from Howes &amp; Ors on 6 May 1999 on the security of Mr and Mrs Pappas' third party mortgage, had been received by the bankrupt from Regis Towers and further that the $345,000 lent by Mr and Mrs Pappas to the bankrupt on or about 7 May 2001 had been received by the bankrupt from Regis Towers on or before 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">234 There were other flaws in the Administrator's attempted reconstruction, such as reliance on 'Adjustments'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">235 One other aspect of the matter that needs to be considered, and upon which the Trustee relies, is the lack of any allowance for directors' fees to be paid by Regis Towers to the bankrupt in respect of the period 1 July 2002 --- 31 December 2004, even though significant directors' fees had been provided for, and also included by the bankrupt in his tax returns, for earlier years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">The directors' loan account for the year ended 30 June 2000 showed $269,000 as being payable to the bankrupt for 'Director Fee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">In his tax return for that financial year, the bankrupt in fact disclosed the receipt of $271,000 as 'Directors bonus --- Regis Towers'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">236 The Trustee's submission is that, taking all these matters into account, it cannot be said that the Trustee wrongfully rejected Regis Towers' proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">237 
 
The decision of the Trustee to reject in whole Regis Towers' proof of debt lodged by Regis Towers with the Trustee under cover of the administrator's letter dated 20 March 2006 should be confirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">I certify that the preceding two hundred and thirty-seven (237) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
