<sentence id="s0">
 On 14 August 2009, I made a number of declarations and granted orders in the nature of injunctions in respect of conduct in contravention of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act) by: Mobilegate Ltd - the First Respondent (Mobilegate); Winning Bid Pty Ltd - the Second Respondent (Winning Bid); Mr Simon Anthony Owen - the Fourth Respondent (Mr Owen); Mr Tarek Andreas Salcedo - the Fifth Respondent (Mr Salcedo); and Glenn Christopher Maughan - the seventh respondent (Mr Maughan).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">
At the same time I gave directions in respect of the filing and service of material relating to civil penalties in respect of those contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I appointed today as the date for hearing in respect of penalty matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">These reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with those which I delivered on 14 August 2009: see Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No2) [2009] FCA 887.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Pursuant to the directions given on 14 August 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the Authority), as Applicant, served upon the Respondents, which and whom I have mentioned, written submissions together with affidavits to be relied upon in respect of penalty or otherwise identified affidavits in respect of which reliance was to be placed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">For their part none of the named Respondents has chosen to appear today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">That, of course, is their perfect right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">One of them, Mr Salcedo, did, though, choose to correspond with the Registry of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He did this by a letter dated 28 September 2009 received by the Registry that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That letter now forms part of exhibit 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">A subsequent exchange of correspondence occurred as between the Registry and Mr Salcedo on the subject of whether it was his intention that the letter stand as his submissions in relation to the penalty hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In the letter, which I record expressly I have taken into account, Mr Salcedo makes a number of assertions in relation to his involvement with corporate contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Those assertions, at least on one view, are not consistent with the judgment entered against him by default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He has not applied to set aside the default judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It would be subversive of the process of justice to afford such assertions weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I should also record that another of the Respondents of interest today, Mr Owen, filed with the Court an affidavit pursuant to orders ancillary to injunctive orders of a Mareva nature which it became necessary to make as a sequel to the default judgment entered on 14 August 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Owen has not sought to rely upon that affidavit in relation to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">While, properly, the Authority has noted the existence of that affidavit, its position is that it does not accept the evidence given in that affidavit in relation to Mr Owen's financial position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Rather, were the affidavit to be relied upon by Mr Owen in relation to any question touching upon penalty, the Authority would seek to cross-examine Mr Owen in respect of that to which he deposes in that affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Owen has not sought to rely upon the affidavit in relation to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In that circumstance I pay no regard to the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">What remains for determination in respect of Mobilegate, Winning Bid, Mr Owen, Mr Salcedo and Mr Maughan is the question of the amount, if any, that ought to be imposed by way of penalty in respect of the contraventions which are the subject of judgment in default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There can be no question that the contraventions require the imposition of a penalty and a very substantial penalty indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The conduct concerned constitutes a series of contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That section materially prohibits the sending, or causing to be sent, of commercial electronic messages that have an Australian link and that are, in effect, unsolicited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Provision is made by s 24 of the Spam Act for the imposition of pecuniary penalties by way of civil penalty if this Court is satisfied that a person, ie, a body corporate or an individual, has contravened a provision such as s 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">If so satisfied, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty in respect of each contravention as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Read in isolation, that provision might be thought to provide for unlimited penalisation of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, provision is made by s 25 , for what are to be the maximum penalties for contraventions of civil penalty provisions such as s 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Section 24(2) of the Spam Act sets out, in a non-exhaustive way, a number of matters to which the Court should have regard in determining the pecuniary penalty to fix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I shall return in some detail to the considerations specified in s 24(2) , insofar as they relate to the circumstances of this case, in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">For the present, it might be observed that the considerations specified in s 24(2) , save for that in para (e), bear a strong resemblance to those found in s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Trade Practices Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 24(2)(e) provides that if the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so, whether the person has previously been found by a court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct, is a relevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">That sub-section articulates overtly a consideration which would, in any event, be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It is further a consideration which, though not expressly articulated in s 76 of the Trade Practices Act , would be relevant to a penalty proceeding under that Act in particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As it happens, a court in a foreign country has not found the Respondents concerned to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">There was, at one stage though, a disposition on the part of the Authority to rely upon findings and penalties in respect of conduct in the United Kingdom by one of the Respondents of concern today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the end though, that particular disposition did not manifest itself in evidence before me in relation to proceedings abroad, nor had evidence in relation to such proceedings proposed to be relied upon been served upon the Respondent concerned, as the interlocutory directions in respect of the penalty proceeding would have required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">At best, it would seem that the conduct concerned was what one might term parallel in time to that the subject of Australian regulatory interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Had there been evidence of prior findings in respect of prior conduct, ie, conduct prior to the alleged contraventions, those findings would have had a particular relevance in terms of assessing the gravity of the later Australian-related conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">As things stand, and in the absence of evidence, I expressly do not take into account any matter touching upon any alleged conduct in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Rather, I approach the matter on the basis that none of the Respondents have been the subject of adverse findings abroad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Authority put forward that the conduct concerned in itself, insofar as it related to Australia, was of such gravity that, in a relative sense, parallel, as compared with prior, conduct abroad would not materially affect any question as to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It expressly sought the deletion of reference in its written submissions to such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is not impossible to conceive how parallel conduct might yield a view as to whether one should regard Australian-related conduct as but an isolated geographic aberration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It might also yield a view as to the overall worth of a Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Nonetheless, it is in this case only the Australian-related conduct that I take into account, and I do so, in the end, at the invitation of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Authority's stance, in my respectful opinion, reflected a very proper approach for an agency of the Commonwealth to take in circumstances where a particular Respondent had not appeared before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In summary, the contraventions of s 16 which are established are contraventions which involve the sending of unsolicited short message service - SMS messages - to the mobile telephones of users who have been deceived, inveigled even, into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate or, as the case may be, Winning Bid, under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and to form relationships via dating websites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In fact, these users of the mobile telephones were the prey of Mobilegate or, as the case may be, Winning Bid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Those users were targeted via fabricated dating website profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">That targeting was at the heart of a scheme, the design of which was to cause those mobile telephone users to exchange SMS messages using premium telephone numbers operated on behalf of either Mobilegate or Winning Bid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The users were charged amounts of up to $5 per message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There is some evidence before me as to amounts derived by Mobilegate and Winning Bid through this particular scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I shall detail that shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In an interlocutory judgment which I delivered on 22 May 2009, I observed that: 
 
 The use of trickery to prey for reward upon the lusts or emotional vulnerabilities of others is hardly a vice confined to modern times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">What modern times do offer, for those disposed to such a vice, are new means of prey, the internet, and the mobile telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 

The corporate Respondents, Mobilegate and Winning Bid, and those of the individual Respondents with which I am concerned today, Messrs Owen, Salcedo and Maughan, might aptly be described as predators on the emotionally vulnerable for reward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">That is a particularly vile form of behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Spam Act provides for the imposition of penalties which, in the application of that Act to the circumstances of this particular case, are substantial indeed as to their maximum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It is necessary to relate in a little detail how that transpires, having regard to s 25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">For a corporate entity which has not been found previously to have contravened the Spam Act the maximum penalty as provided for by s 25(3) is 100 penalty units per single contravention, or if the Court finds that the body corporate has on a particular day committed two or more contraventions, 2000 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">For an individual who has not previously been found to have contravened the Spam Act the maximum penalty as provided for by s 25(4) is 20 penalty units per single contravention, or if the Court finds that the person has on a particular day committed two or more contraventions, 400 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Spam Act incorporates by reference the meaning given by s 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to a penalty unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is there provided presently that a penalty unit is $110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">By a process of mathematics one therefore derives that the maximum applicable penalty per day on which more than one contravention is found to have occurred is $220,000 in the case of a body corporate and $44,000 in the case of an individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In this particular case, many days are involved in which contravening conduct occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">That has a corresponding effect on the theoretical maximum penalty applicable in respect of the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">On the evidence to hand, so far as Mobilegate is concerned, it appears - and this is as best an approximation as I can make - that the number of days on which two or more contraventions occurred was 331 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In all, were one to assess a theoretical maximum in respect of Mobilegate, one would derive a maximum penalty under the Spam Act of something in excess of $72 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As to Winning Bid, the approximate number of days on the evidence in terms of best estimation on which two or more contraventions occurred was 187 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Again, in terms of the theoretical maximum in respect of the contraventions, the subject of default judgment, the maximum penalty applicable in respect of Winning Bids conduct would be $40 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is a possible but in the end only a theoretical exercise to look to maximums which might be applicable under s 25 in respect of those individuals who have been adjudged to be parties to corporate contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">I shall make some reference to authority touching upon maximum penalty in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">For the present it is instructive to consider both individually and then in their totality the particular individual considerations specified in s 24(2) of the Spam Act save of course for that specified in s 24(20(e) to which I have already made reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Before so doing it is helpful to reflect upon some general principles which are pertinent, in my opinion, to the imposition of pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">There is but one directly applicable authority in respect of the Spam Act and the imposition of penalties under that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">That is a judgment delivered by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">One finds, with respect, in his Honour's judgment in Clarity1 a very helpful collation indeed of relevant principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It is apparent from Clarity1 that Nicholson J was of the opinion that assistance was to be derived in terms of principle from judgments delivered in respect of civil penalties imposed under the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I respectfully agree with this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">To that end, the following general principles are pertinent: the size of the contravening company; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it occurred; whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management in a corporation or at a lower level; whether the corporation has a culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as, for example, evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures which are taken institutionally in response to an acknowledged contravention; whether the respondent, be it corporate or individual, has cooperated with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention; (and this may be part of the size of the corporation, where it is a corporate respondent), the financial position of the contravener and its, his or her capacity to pay; the deterrent effect, both specific and general, of the proposed penalty; the totality principle; and parity and, I think, also relativity of penalty, with other respondents, having regard to individual circumstances of involvement in a contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">There are other statements in authorities under the Trade Practices Act which are, in my opinion, germane in relation to the imposition of penalty in respect of Spam Act prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Thus, under the Trade Practices Act , it is relevant to take into account whether the conduct that contravened the Act was systematic, deliberate or covert: see J McPhee and Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [158] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
In this case, the contravening conduct might aptly be described by each of those adjectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In other words, it was systematic, it was deliberate and, materially, covert in terms of the ability of those mobile phone users preyed upon to ascertain readily the identity of their predator if they were disposed to seek recourse to the courts to recover moneys lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">I shall elaborate a little further on that aspect in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Again, in terms of Trade Practices Act authorities, there is useful guidance on the role of both specific and general deterrence in the imposition of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1985) 4 FCR 296 at pages 297 to 298, Toohey J, then a judge of this Court, remarked: 
 
 The penalty should be such as to deter not only the particular offender but others who may be disposed to engage in prohibited conduct of a similar kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 
 That, in my opinion, is a particularly weighty consideration in relation to Spam Act contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">This case discloses on the evidence that while it is possible for a regulatory authority, through diligent investigation, to detect not only those corporations but those individuals involved in contraventions, the task is not an easy or an inexpensive one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It consumes public resources which might otherwise usefully be deployed to other ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">That being so, penalties in respect of contraventions must be such as to deter the unscrupulous from taking a calculated business risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In other words, in my opinion, penalties must be of such an order that having regard to particular gains which might be involved, it is in effect commercial suicide to seek those gains via contraventions of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Sentiments such as these are evident in prior authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at pages 294 to 295 (NW Frozen Foods), a Full Court opined: 
 
 The court should not leave room for any impression of weakness in its resolve to impose penalties sufficient to ensure the deterrence, not only of the parties actually before it, but also of others who might be tempted to think that contravention would pay ... 
 
 To like effect is the following observation of Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 42-031 at [15]: 
 
 The penalty must be sufficiently high that a business, acting rationally and in its own best interest, will not be prepared to treat the risk of such a penalty as a business cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 Of course, a penalty should not be so high as to be oppressive, but it is important in this regard to recall exactly what is meant by that sentiment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">That was, with respect, aptly and accurately stated by Merkel J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 ; (2005) 215 ALR 281 (Leahy Petroleum (No 2)) at para 9 as follows, (and this is a reference to observations made by Smithers J in a case, Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Australia) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 , which had been referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods): 
 
 I therefore respectfully agree with the observation of Smithers J, referred to by Burchett and Kiefel JJ in NW Frozen Foods, to the effect that, a penalty that is of no greater than is necessary to achieve the object of general deterrence, will not be oppressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 
 I intend to follow those general principles in relation to the imposition of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Also of great importance in a case such as this, where daily penalties accumulate, is the totality principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I shall have a little more to say about that shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As I have mentioned, there is but one earlier authority dealing directly with the Spam Act : Clarity1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The utility in that case is for its collation of principle in relation to the imposition of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I have drawn upon that collation in making the statements already given with respect to principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is not, though, a case uncritically to apply as a comparative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The circumstances of that case were different to those of the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Respondents concerned are to be dealt with by reference to their particular contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">This is not one of those cases of the kind encountered in the State criminal courts where, by reference to a high volume of analogous criminal conduct, it is possible to set, and then for sentencing judges to have regard to, particular benchmarks derived from guidance given by a Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I have already referred to theoretical maximums that one might derive in respect of the corporate Respondents, and to the ability to make an estimation of theoretical maximums in respect of individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, in relation to maximum sentences said at [30]: 
 
 Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Judges need sentencing yardsticks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In their book Sentencing , Stockdale and Devlin observe that: 
 

 
 
 
 "A maximum sentence fixed by parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century ... or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level ... At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties ... 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate].</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">" 
 
 
 
 And then at [31]: 
 
 It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all the other relevant factors, a yardstick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 
 I turn to look at particular factors designated in s 24 as relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Obviously enough, these factors are measured against the matters pleaded in the statement of claim, and the evidence upon which the Authority seeks to rely and of which notice has been given to the particular Respondents; in particular, affidavits of Mr Weber, filed on 12 May, 13 May, and 21 May 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Nature and Extent of Contraventions
 I have already described these contraventions as deliberate, systematic and covert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Authority submits that the conduct was duplicitous and exploitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Between at least January 2006 and December 2008, the conduct involved the following: setting up fake profiles on dating websites and communicating with users of that dating websites to entice them to hand over details of their mobile phone number, as if they were communicating with another user of a dating website; sending SMS messages to those mobile telephone numbers by particular premium number services and engaging the users to engage in an exchange of SMS messages, as if with a potential dating partner; extending the deception of users by pretending premium short codes were being used as a "safe divert" service to enable the sender and receiver to communicate without the other party directly disclosing their mobile telephone number as a matter of caution; and obtaining revenue from the sending or receipt of the SMS messages via those premium numbers as a result of fees charged to the user of each message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The premium short code numbers concerned were changed regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">They were changed so as to avoid or overcome detection and complaints against the corporate respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">So far as the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents, Messrs Owen, Salcedo and Maughan were concerned, their involvement, in terms of the judgment entered by default against them and in terms of the affidavit evidence, is extensive, knowing and persistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Persistent also is a failure to address complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The length of involvement in contravening conduct varies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Mobilegate
 Mobilegate was incorporated on 20 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It was responsible for sending and receipt of SMS messages via particular premium numbers, more particularly described in the statement of claim, from 15 November 2007 through to 29 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mobilegate's earnings, as received from the aggregator Sybase, from the operation of the premium short codes, was in excess of $1.1 million between November 2007 and August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Mobilegate received additional revenue from the aggregator Oxygen 8 in relation to another premium short codes operation from October 2008 to January 2009 in excess of $200,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Those earnings are pertinent, on the subject of penalty, having regard to what I have already stated to be a principle of general deterrence in the imposition of penalties sufficiently high to make it commercial suicide to attempt to obtain such earnings by breaching the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Winning Bid
 Winning Bid was incorporated on 1 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It was responsible for the sending and receipt of a number of SMS messages via premium numbers described in the statement of claim from 1 April 2007 until 15 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">On the latter date, Winning Bid assigned its application messaging services agreement with Sybase to Mobilegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The earnings of Winning Bid from the operation of the premium short codes concerned between April 2007 and November 2007 was in excess of $300,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Mr Owen
 Mr Owen had an earlier involvement as sole director with a company known as International Machinery Parts Proprietary Limited (IMP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The conduct the subject of these proceedings initiated with IMP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">IMP received payments from Sybase for the operation of particular short codes in respect of the period 1 January 2006 to 30 April 2007, totalling $690,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Mr Owen was the director of Winning Bid from August 2006 to April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">He was also manager of Mobilegate from August 2007 to November 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Of each of the individual Respondents with whom I am concerned today, his involvement was the longest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It follows from this, in terms of the default judgment as well, that he has been involved in the greatest number of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It is apparent on the evidence that Mr Owen was involved in establishing the premium short code operations initially via IMP in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">He is aptly described as the directing mind and will of each of the companies involved between 2006 and 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It was his details which appeared on contracts with aggregators for the provision of various short codes and also in correspondence with aggregators in relation to complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It is relevant to note that Mr Owen was the sole director of IMP when that company was the subject of an infringement notice issued by the authority pursuant to the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It is also relevant to note that Mr Owen was an individual respondent in proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court against a company, Dancertext, and him: see Wood v Dancertext Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 1410 (Dancertext).</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The conduct described in the reasons for judgment of Raphael FM bears particular comparison with the subject of the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Mr Salcedo
 Mr Salcedo was the manager of IMP from June 2006 to May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">He was the manager of Winning Bid from April 2007 and the manager of Mobilegate from August 2007 to April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">There is also a basis for regarding him, de facto, as a director of Mobilegate even prior to his taking up that position in April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In June 2006, Mr Salcedo corresponded with the Authority on behalf of IMP in relation to complaints which came to form the basis of the infringement notice to which I have referred already.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Salcedo was responsible for the day to day management of Mobilegate's business from August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">He set up that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">He purportedly relinquished the directorship of the company in favour of Mr Scott Moles, with whom I am not concerned today, on 20 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">It was Mr Salcedo who was responsible for the supervision of Mr Maughan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It was also Mr Salcedo who responded to what can only be described as a large amount of correspondence from aggregators and regulators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">At the least, Mr Salcedo might be described as an influential and involved manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Mr Maughan
 Mr Maughan was an employee of Jobspy, another Respondent with which I am not concerned today, and Winning Bid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">He was engaged as a supervisor of other staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">He sent SMS messages to mobile phone users between the period January 2006 to November 2008, excluding from that period June to October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He was responsible for the instruction of new staff, managing staff on a day to day basis, monitoring the number of SMS messages sent and answering complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">There are at least two categories of loss which one might identify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">That suffered by members of the public who were mobile phone users and that suffered by operators of dating websites through which fake profiles were placed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Mobile phone users
 Obviously enough, given the financial ends to which the scheme was directed, there is financial loss in respect of individual mobile phone users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That apart, there is at least inferentially and in some cases necessarily an emotional toll which does not readily admit of quantification but is doubtless real enough in individual cases and readily understandable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The message logs demonstrate that when users queried or complained about premium short code charges being imposed upon them for sending or receiving the SMS messages, the employees of Mobilegate, or as the case may be, Winning Bid, or agents of those companies, informed them that both the sender and the recipient were paying the same charges for the messages and that the communication via the "safe divert" service was a means of concealing the other party's mobile telephone number so they could safely communicate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">This was done I find to encourage the users to continue to exchange messages resulting directly in revenue to those with whom I am concerned today either directly or in their capacity as officers or employees of those corporations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Here one sees the covert nature of the deception being undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The loss which the mobile phone users suffered came to them by way of their telephone accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">There was no need, given the nature of the scheme for Mobilegate and Winning Bid directly to bill them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The nature of the scheme meant that those mobile phone telephone users faced the obstacle of dealing through their mobile telephone service provider to identify what they had been charged, by whom and for what purported service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">They were in jeopardy in the event of non-payment of disconnection of their mobile telephone service or at least in an adverse noting being made in respect of them by that mobile telephone service provider and perhaps more widely in terms of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The design and operation of the safe divert scheme also deliberately preyed upon vulnerable aspects of the victims of the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I have already made reference to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It is apparent from the message logs that many users sent a large number of messages and accordingly spent what, for individuals, could only be significant amounts of money before realising that the person with whom they were communicating was not a genuine member or user of a dating website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">This is cruel behaviour; cruel and callous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Quite apart from the obstacles that an individual would face in seeking to garner evidence of exactly who had preyed upon them, the Authority submits that there is an inference that embarrassment or shame associated with exposing publicly by litigation having been duped in this exploitive fashion would tend to suppress the individual seeking of financial redress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">That type of shame or embarrassment is not unknown in our law in relation to the readiness with which certain kinds of sexual offences are reported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">In my opinion there is much to be said in favour of that particular quality attending the readiness with which individuals might care to seek particular redress from their exploiter in this type of conduct as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">That quality only serves to aggravate the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">By that I mean that it is of such an intimate exploitive nature that the exploiter by the very conduct gives itself, himself or herself, a degree of insulation at a practical level from suits for financial recovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">I take that aggravating factor into account in the imposition of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Based on the revenue shares agreements and payment schedules which have been set out in the evidence read before me, the total estimated financial loss to individual mobile telephone users, to consumers, by way of telephone charges incurred as a result of conduct by the Respondents with whom I am concerned today, was in excess of some $4 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Again, that is a factor to take into account in relation to the imposition of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Dating Website Operators
 I turn to the question of losses which one might apprehend dating website operators suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">These operators, of course, have a legitimate and lawful role to play in our society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">One might describe them, in the language of earlier times, as "matchmakers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">" In so doing, a medium apt for modern times is used: the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In addition to the losses suffered by mobile phone users, the operators of dating websites, which the respondents Mobilegate and Winning Bid used, were the recipients of fake profiles from those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It is possible to identify financial loss, but it is not readily to possible to quantify that loss arising from factors such as: dealing with complaints from users of a dating website who associated the Safe Divert scheme with the operator of the website itself; undermining confidence in that website by users with associated reputational and, hence, goodwill damage via word of mouth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">That, in turn, one might apprehend, would translate into a loss of lawful revenue for the website; and monitoring and other policing costs incurred by website operators in an endeavour to identify and remove those who placed fake profiles or sought to place fake profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Circumstances in which the Contraventions Took Place
 These circumstances include the circumstance that the conduct took place in circumstances where a director of Winning Bid had faced administrative action by the Authority in relation to similar conduct, as well as court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I refer in this regard to Mr Owen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The contraventions occurred in circumstances where, by virtue of Winning Bid and Mobilegate's contracts with aggregators for the providing of premium short codes, the corporate respondents had expressly agreed to comply with the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The corporate Respondents, Mobilegate and Winning Bid, had faced regular complaints from mobile telephone service providers and from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, as well as some particular mobile phone users, about their conduct, yet it continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Requirements to obtain consent to the sending of SMS messages were also brought to the direct attention of the Respondents with which and whom I am concerned today, in the providing of new premium short codes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The communication logs of Sybase, which are in evidence, show that these complaints and the requirements for consent were routinely brushed aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">That, too, is an aggravating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The corporate Respondents either themselves engaged or caused others to engage a network of individuals, whose job it was to set up fake profiles on dating websites then invent SMS messages to send via the Mobilegate computer system to the mobile phone users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In this sense, the corporate respondents and the individuals, Messrs Owen, Salcedo and Maughan, might be described as "puppeteers" for earnings by preying upon emotionally vulnerable individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The subordinate individuals were instructed on how to avoid detection on dating websites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">They were directed to cast messages so as to entice ongoing responses from mobile phone users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">As I have already mentioned, Mr Maughan was responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the operations of such individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">All of this conduct was directed to the maximisation of the income of the corporate Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In evidence before me are printouts of the fake dating profiles, as well as logs of communications from specified profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">These make depressing reading, when one knows that the profiles concerned are fake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">There to be seen are communications under the guise of the profile, which were used as what the Authority aptly describes as a "lure" for the member of the public to provide his or her mobile phone number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Financial exploitation then followed when that lure yielded a strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">There is, overall, a consistent pattern of studied deception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">It is not possible to see any mitigating factor in the behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Whether the Person Has Previously Been Found By the Court in Proceedings Under the Act to Have Engaged in Similar Conduct
 I have already made reference to proceedings against, materially, Mr Owen, in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">I have also made reference to regulatory action taken by the Authority in the past against IMP at a time when Mr Owen was a director of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Size of the Contravening Company
 So far as Mobilegate is concerned, there is no evidence directly which is of assistance in relation to the size of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I have already made reference, though, to the earnings that it derived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Deliberateness of the Contravention and the Period over which it Extended
 I have referred already to the period involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">It is more particularly delineated in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">There is no doubt that the contraventions were deliberate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Whether the Contravention Arose out of the Conduct of Senior Management or at a Lower Level
 These contraventions involved behaviour which was caused by the senior management of the companies concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">I have described the involvement of particular individuals in corporate directorship or management already.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">A factor which is worthy to note in this regard is that the contravening conduct was not an incident of an otherwise lawful business, rather, the very essence of the businesses conducted by Mobilegate and Winning Bid, materially, was conduct designed to contravene section 16 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">That is a factor, in my opinion, which is relevant to general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The penalties must be of a level which would make it, as I have already said, commercial suicide to set up a business which has, as its aim, the contravention of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Whether the Company has a Corporate Culture Conducive to Compliance with the Act
 A short answer to such a consideration is that neither company, on the evidence, had any such culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">To the contrary, the cultures revealed were cultures of studied non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Whether the Respondent has Shown a Disposition to Cooperate with the Authorities Responsible for the Enforcement of the Act in Relation to the Contravention
 The Respondents with which and whom I am concerned today were, at early stages of this litigation, represented by lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Legal representation, though, ceased some time ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">There is no evident cooperation with the administration of justice in the behaviours of any of the Respondents with which or whom I am concerned today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">At its highest, it would seem to be that they are not concerned, individually, to put particular factors which might stand in their favour before the Court, but rather to let proceedings take their course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">There is certainly nothing in the evidence which would suggest that any of the Respondents with which and whom I am concerned today are disposed to engage in education in relation to Spam Act responsibilities or otherwise to conduct themselves in a way that would be compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">There is simply no evidence at all of attitude in the future other than the inferences which might arise by reference to past behaviours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">They are hardly inferences which stand in favour of mitigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The Financial Position of the Contravening Party and Capacity to Pay
 There is no evidence before me in relation to capacity to pay in respect of any of the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The Authority submits that an approach evident in Nicholson J's judgment in relation to capacity to pay in Clarity1 is apposite in the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">His Honour stated at para 43: 
 
 Also I accept that the issue of capacity to pay is, although a relevant factor, of less relevance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 
 His Honour then makes reference in that regard to Leahy Petroleum (No 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Deterrent Effect of the Proposed Penalty
 I have already made reference to a particular importance in general deterrence in the imposition of penalty in respect of contraventions of this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">It may be noted that Parliament itself has, in a sense, capped daily maximum penalties so as to avoid what one might regard as exponential and thus unrealistically large penalties for multiple contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">That said, Parliament has, nonetheless, provided for penalties which accrue, at least on a daily basis, which are significant penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">In this case, the Authority seeks penalties which are not particularly large, having regard to theoretical maximums, but are large having regard to totality, but not so large as to offend that principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The totality principle requires that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">So far as penalty is concerned, the Authority submits that penalties should fall within the following ranges: The Authority submits that, though these penalty ranges are substantial, they do not violate the totality principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">They represent a relatively small proportion of the theoretical legislatively-derived maximum amounts in the circumstances of these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">So far as the corporate Respondents are concerned, they are in the order of 5% to 7% of theoretical maximums.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I agree with this particular submission so far as the application of the totality principle is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Parity and Relativity
 The proposed penalty ranges do, in my opinion, reflect appropriate parity and relativities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">This might be highlighted in the following way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">As between Mobilegate and Winning Bid, Mobilegate's conduct covered a longer period: 331 days as opposed to 187 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Next, as between individual Respondents, Messrs Owen and Salcedo had a higher level, and a significantly higher level, of authority in the management and control of the corporations than did Mr Maughan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Nonetheless, each of the individual Respondents was involved for over 800 individual days of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Mr Maughan's subordination is recognised by the penalty range submitted for him being in the order of 40 % to 50 % of that submitted as apt in respect of Messrs Owen and Salcedo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Next, as between Messrs Owen and Salcedo, there is, on the evidence, a higher level of active involvement by Mr Salcedo, and this occurred notwithstanding that there was in place a disqualification against his managing corporations at the behest of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Mr Owen, on the other hand, had been the subject of litigation in respect of analogous behaviour: Dancertext.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Further, he was the director of IMP at the time when it was the recipient of a Spam Act infringement notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Thus, one can see that there are factors which interplay as to whose is the more intimate involvement and whose involvement has occurred against a background of aggravating factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In the end, such comparisons become too fine to admit of anything other, in my opinion, than regarding each of them as equally culpable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">It is by no means impossible to conceive of a slightly higher --- perhaps even more than slightly higher --- maximum for the range that would be apt having regard to the totality principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">However, the range which has been the subject of submissions is also that which was put to each of the Respondents today as the range that the Authority would seek, in its submissions, to submit as appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">In those circumstances, in my opinion, unless I were of the view that that range, in its maximum, was so inappropriate as not to be germane to a just imposition of penalty, I ought not to depart from that range so far as maximum is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Reasonable minds might reasonably differ in relation to maximum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The minimum, having regard to the aggravating factors, is, indeed, a minimum in the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The range submitted by the Authority is, subject to the observations that I have made, one which I regard as an appropriate range for the imposition of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">I have already, though, used particular adjectives to describe the conduct concerned, both corporate and, by involvement as a party to corporate conduct, individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">I have deliberately used strong adjectives to express, on behalf of the community, disapproval, and strong disapproval, of the conduct concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The aggravating factors that I have mentioned and the need to ensure, insofar as general deterrence can ever, that this type of conduct is not repeated, in my opinion calls for the imposition of the maximum penalty in each case in the ranges proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The penalties, therefore, that I impose in this matter are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">In respect of Mobilegate I impose one penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">That penalty will be a civil penalty of $5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">In respect of Winning Bid I again impose one penalty in respect of the contravening conduct, and that penalty is $3.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">In respect of Mr Owen I again impose one penalty in respect of the contravening conduct, and that civil penalty is $3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In respect of Mr Salcedo, I again impose one penalty, and that civil penalty is $3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">In respect of Mr Maughan I again impose one penalty in respect of the contravening conduct, and that civil penalty is $1.25 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The Respondents ought to be allowed some time to digest the reasons for judgment and, further, to make such inquiries as they can with their bankers or to make such checks as they can of their own finances in relation to ability to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Some time, therefore, in my opinion, ought to be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">I therefore allow twenty-eight (28) days for payment in each instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In each instance the civil penalty which I have imposed is to be paid to the Commonwealth of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In respect of the civil penalty hearing today I order that the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents pay the Authority's costs, of and incidental to the penalty hearing, to be taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">I certify that the preceding eighty-six (86) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
