1 By this Application, David James Walters and Rhondda Isobel Walters appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming an objection decision in respect of each taxpayer made by the Commissioner of Taxation pursuant to the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) to disallow an objection by each taxpayer against an assessment of income tax based upon income said to be derived by each taxpayer in the year ending 30 June 2000, the subject of an amended assessment dated 6 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The respondent issued an amended assessment on the footing that a series of transactions entered into during April 1999 commencing with each taxpayer disposing of a $1.00 share issued to each taxpayer at par in a company called Dart Trading Co Pty Ltd ('Dart Trading') to a separate company wholly controlled in each case by the respective taxpayer and concluding with a sale by each taxpayer of an interest in the share in the capacity of trustee of the relevant trust (as vendor in each case) to Terrence John Walters (the brother of David Walters) and Annette Mary Walters (the wife of Terrence Walters) for a purchase price of $350,000.00, was a sham and ought to be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Thus, the Commissioner contended that each taxpayer had received a capital gain upon the disposal of the asset on 10 September 1999 of $349,999.00 which formed part of each taxpayer's assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The respondent issued the amended assessment on the alternative footing that the sequence of transactions leading up to the sale to Terrence and Annette Walters constituted a scheme for the purposes of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the 1936 Act') and that each taxpayer had entered into the scheme for the dominant purpose of 'obtaining a tax benefit' in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The tax benefit was said to be the avoidance or non-inclusion of an amount that would have been included in the assessable income of the taxpayer but for the taxpayer entering into or carrying out the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the respondent on the footing that the sequence of transactions was not a sham; each taxpayer intended the transactions to take effect according to their terms so as to bring about an uplift in the cost base of each share from $1.00 to $350,000.00 in the hands of the vendor of each share in the capacity of trustee of the relevant trust; the transactions had that effect; and the taxpayer did not incur a capital gain of $349,999.00 upon the sale of each share to Terrence and Annette Walters, subject to Part IVA of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, in affirming the decision under review, the Tribunal concluded that the series of transactions that preceded the ultimate sale of each share to Terrence and Annette Walters comprised a scheme entered into or carried out by each taxpayer for the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit in connection with the scheme namely, avoiding an amount of $349,999.00 in the case of each taxpayer that would have been included in the assessable income of each taxpayer in the year ending 30 June 2000 had not the scheme been entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The Tribunal concluded that notwithstanding an election by each taxpayer under s 122-15 of Subdivision 122-A of Division 122 of Part 3 - 3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the 1997 Act') to obtain a 'roll-over' upon the disposal of each Dart Trading share to Sailpeal Pty Ltd ('Sailpeal') in the case of David Walters and Port Bracknell Pty Ltd ('Port Bracknell') in the case of Rhondda Walters, each taxpayer was unable to enliven an exclusion from the notion of 'obtaining a tax benefit', provided by s 177C(2)(a)(i) of Part IVA of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that each taxpayer had obtained a benefit for the purposes of s 177D of the 1936 Act and that each taxpayer had entered into or carried out a part of the scheme for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Tribunal thus affirmed the respondent's objection decision disallowing each applicant's objection to the amended assessment arising out of the respondent's determination that the whole of the capital gain be included in the assessable income of each taxpayer for the year of income ending 30 June 2000, pursuant to s 177F(1)(a) of Part IVA of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 The Tribunal however did not affirm the respondent's decision to impose by way of penalty, additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondent imposed additional tax by way of penalty under s 226L of the 1936 Act and alternatively pursuant to s 226 of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal determined that since each taxpayer had entered into a scheme for the purposes of Part IVA resulting in a determination under s 177F(1), additional tax by way of penalty might be imposed pursuant to s 226(2) of 50% of the tax payable arising out of the cancellation of the tax benefit, unless a reasonable argument was available to the taxpayer that Part IVA did not apply, in which event the additional tax by way of penalty would be 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal concluded that each taxpayer did have a reasonably arguable case that Part IVA did not apply and accordingly the Tribunal reduced the amount of additional tax to 25% of the tax payable arising out of the inclusion of the relevant amount in each taxpayer's assessable income in the year ending 30 June 2000 pursuant to the determination made under s 177F(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 The applicants contend that the following questions of law arise to be determined on this appeal:
 
 
 (a) Whether the Tribunal misconstrued the true meaning and effect of s 177C(2)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA36); 
 
 (b) Whether the Tribunal was correct to conclude, as it purported to at paragraph 51 of the Reasons, that the Applicants were unable to bring themselves within the exemption provided for in s 177C(2)(a)(i); 
 
 (c) Whether the Tribunal misconstrued the true meaning and effect of s 177D(b)(i) to (viii) of the ITAA 36; 
 
 (d) Whether the Tribunal was correct to conclude, as it purported to do, at paragraphs 62 and 63 of its Reasons, that the sole or dominant purpose of the Applicants' entry into the scheme, as identified by the Commissioner of Taxation and accepted by the Tribunal at paragraph 44 of its Reasons, was the obtaining of a tax benefit, being the benefit identified by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 
 
 

8 The applicants contend that the Tribunal erred in law by concluding at para 51 of its reasons that the applicants were unable to bring themselves within the exception provided for in s 177C(2)(a)(i) of the 1936 Act and erred in applying s 177C(2)(a)(i) of the 1936 Act to the facts as found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">9 The applicants give four particulars in support of the notion that the Tribunal erred in law in applying s 177C(2)(a)(i) to the findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The particulars are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The scheme identified by the respondent and accepted by the Tribunal comprised a series of transactions which preceded the ultimate sale of each share but not the actual sale of the share (para 44, reasons --- particular (i)); the tax benefit identified by the respondent but not accepted by the Tribunal was that each taxpayer would have been required to include $349,999.00 being the sale price of each share less a cost base of $1.00 in the taxpayer's assessable income but for the scheme (para 45, reasons --- particular (ii)); the tax benefit identified by the Tribunal arose out of steps implemented in the scheme that led to an uplift in the cost base of the shares having regard to particular transactions and the parties to those transactions (para 50, reasons --- particular (iii)); and if a tax benefit arose out of an uplift in the cost base of the shares in the hands of particular parties, it was not a tax benefit obtained by either applicant but rather a tax benefit obtained by the trustee of the relevant trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">10 As to the amount of additional tax imposed by way of penalty, the Commissioner of Taxation appeals by an Amended Notice of Appeal filed 7 February 2006 against the Tribunal's decision on the following grounds:
 
 
 (a) The Tribunal erred in holding, at paragraph 67 of its reasons, that the respondents did have a reasonably arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
 (b) The Tribunal erred in failing to consider, properly or at all, whether it was reasonably arguable, as that expression is defined in s 222C of the ITAA36 that Part IVA of the ITAA36 did not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 (c) On a proper construction of s 226(2) of the ITAA36 and the expression reasonably arguable, the Tribunal should have held that it was not reasonably arguable that Part IVA of the ITAA36 did not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 
 Background Facts 
 
11 The facts found by the Tribunal and its conclusions arising out of those facts are these ([12] --- [49] of these reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 On 19 November 1991, Dart Trading was incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">David and Rhondda Walters, Terrence Walters and his wife Annette Walters became directors and each individual was issued with one ordinary share of $1.00 in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There were no other shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The company conducted the business of a supermarket in Gordonvale in North Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">13 In 1998, the shareholders of Dart Trading conducted discussions with Franklins about the possibility of selling the business (presumably either the business or shares in Dart Trading) to Franklins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Nothing came of those discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The applicants, however, became interested in selling their interest in the business in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">David Walters contended that he was having marriage difficulties; sought a restructuring of his affairs to protect his assets; and contended he was motivated by estate planning purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">14 David Walters met legal advisers about steps that might be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal notes that the applicants gave evidence that they were advised to enter into a transaction in several parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">David Walters 
 
15 As to David Walters, the steps were these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 On 13 April 1999, David Walters entered into an agreement in writing to sell his share in Dart Trading to Sailpeal at a price constituting the market value of the share on 13 April 1999 as determined by a firm of chartered accountants in Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">By cl 2.2 of the agreement, the purchase price would be satisfied by the issue of 2,000 $1.00 shares in Sailpeal to David Walters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">David and Rhondda Walters were appointed directors of Sailpeal and David Walters agreed to provide a duly executed transfer instrument for the share to Sailpeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">17 Having agreed to a transfer of the share in Dart Trading to Sailpeal and Sailpeal having issued 2,000 ordinary non-redeemable shares to him in satisfaction of the consideration, David Walters executed on 13 April 1999 a document for the purposes of Subdivision 122-A of Division 122 of Part 3-3 of the 1997 Act by which he chose to obtain a roll-over pursuant to s 122-15 in respect of the CGT 'trigger event' being the disposal of his share in Dart Trading to Sailpeal, a company in which he owned all of the issued shares immediately after the trigger event (s 122-25, the 1997 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">18 The point of making that election, of course, is that a capital gain 'made from the trigger event is disregarded' (s 122-40).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The policy of the legislation is that if a taxpayer disposes of an asset to an entity wholly owned by the taxpayer immediately after the disposal event, the taxpayer, subject to the provisions of Part 3-3, might be relieved of the immediate consequence of realising a taxable capital gain arising out of a disposal of a CGT asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The capital gain might then be postponed to a later event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The asset retains the same cost base in Sailpeal as it had in the hands of David Walters, namely, the par value issue price of $1.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">19 On 13 April 1999, Maurice John Collins as settlor and Adelong Hills Pty Ltd ('Adelong Hills') as trustee established the Adelong Trust for the benefit of the 'Absolute Beneficiary', Sailpeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">By clause 3.1, the trustee must in each year determine the net income of the Trust Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">By clause 3.2, the trustee holds the net income of the Trust Fund for the absolute benefit of Sailpeal unless the trustee and Sailpeal declare the remaining parts of clause 3 to have effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Clauses 3.3 --- 3.9 confer a discretion upon the trustee to pay, apply or set aside any part of the Trust Fund for all or one or more of the Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Beneficiaries or accumulate the Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">By clause 4.2, the capital of the Trust Fund vests in Sailpeal upon termination of the trust, subject to the trustee and Sailpeal enlivening a discretion in the trustee under clause 4.3 to apply any part of the Trust Fund to the Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Clause 5 confers a power upon the trustee should the trustee and Sailpeal enliven the power, to exercise an absolute discretion at any time to pay or apply the whole or any part of the Trust Fund to or for the benefit of all or any of the Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Clause 9 deals with special powers and discretions of the trustee and clause 9.3 provides that the power of appointing a new trustee shall vest in the Principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Principal under the Deed is Sailpeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Under the Adelong Trust, the primary beneficiary is the Australia Red Cross ('Red Cross') and the secondary beneficiary is the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia ('RFDSA').</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The 'Tertiary Beneficiaries' under the Trust Deed are any trustee of any settlement in which Adelong Hills (as trustee of the Adelong Trust) or the Red Cross or RFDSA is a beneficiary or any company or corporation in which Adelong Hills (as trustee of the Adelong Trust) or the Red Cross or RFDSA hold shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">20 David Walters and Rhondda Walters were appointed directors of Adelong Hills and each held one share in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">21 On 13 April 1999, Sailpeal as beneficial owner of the share in Dart Trading declared that it held its interest in the share 'upon and subject to the trusts of the Adelong Trust' of which it was the 'Absolute Beneficiary'.</sentence>

<sentence id="s55">23 On 13 April 1999, the applicants as directors of Sailpeal, resolved on behalf of the company to consent to the enlivening by the trustee (Adelong Hills) of the discretions and powers conferred by clauses 3.3 --- 3.9, 4.3 and 5.2 --- 5.4 of the Adelong Trust Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">24 On 14 April 1999, Stephanie Maria Mauchlan and Port Bracknell entered into a Trust Deed to establish the Dart Trust for the benefit of the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Primary and Secondary Beneficiaries are the Red Cross and RFDSA respectively.</sentence>

<sentence id="s60">The applicants as directors of Adelong Hills passed resolutions that the company dispose of its right, title and interest in the Dart Trading share to Port Bracknell and in their capacity as directors of Port Bracknell, the applicants resolved to affix the company seal to the agreement and acquire the Dart Trading share in its capacity as trustee of the Dart Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">26 On 14 April 1999, David Walters as Principal under the Trust Deed for the Dart Trust exercised a power pursuant to clause 9.3.2 of the Trust Deed to remove Port Bracknell as trustee of the Dart Trust and personally assume the role of trustee of the Dart Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">By declaration dated 14 April 1999, David Walters acknowledged that as incoming trustee of the Dart Trust, he held the Trust Fund 'upon the same trusts' subsisting prior to the appointment of a new trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">27 Three further trusts were established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">28 On 13 April 1999, Maurice John Collins and Adelong Hills established the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">2 for the benefit of the 'Absolute Beneficiary', Port Bracknell.</sentence>

<sentence id="s75">The directors noted that the Red Cross is a beneficiary of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">3 and thus Peachbronze in its capacity as trustee of that trust is a Tertiary Beneficiary of the Adelong Trust.</sentence>

<sentence id="s107">Terrence Walters made enquiries about sources of finance in early 1999; a valuation dated 11 June 1999 of the shares of the applicant's was obtained from an accountant; the accountant was first approached prior to the transactions of 13 --- 15 April 1999; and the valuation stated that each share had a value of $350,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">40 At the end of May 1999, Terrence Walters told the applicants that Dart Trading was setting aside money in a solicitor's trust account each week in order to fund a purchase of the shares from the applicants.</sentence>

<sentence id="s110">The applicants resigned as directors of Dart Trading on 15 June 1999; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') approved a loan by Dart Trading to the purchasers to buy the shares; and the company resolved on 30 July 1999 to make the loan.</sentence>

41 The sale by David and Rhondda Walters was made in their capacity as trustee of the Dart Trust and the Dart Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">2 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Tribunal notes that each trustee resolved to distribute the income of each trust to the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">That income included the sale proceeds of each share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Tribunal also notes that the trustee of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">3 , Peachbronze, resolved to distribute income of that trust to a tertiary beneficiary of the Trust, so defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">That term included by reason of the mechanism described at para [23] of the Tribunal's reasons, each applicant as a beneficiary of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Each applicant was eligible to and did receive a distribution of income in the year ending 30 June 2000 as a beneficiary of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Uplift in the Cost Base 
 
42 Adelong Hills as trustee of the Adelong Trust sold the share originally held by David Walters, to Port Bracknell as trustee of the Dart Trust for $35,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Adelong Hills as trustee of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">2 sold the share originally held by Rhondda Walters to Sailpeal as trustee of the Dart Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">2 for $35,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Each agreement recognised that the sale price of $35,000.00 was substantially below the market value of $350,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Since the sale agreement was not the expression of an agreement between arms-length parties in connection with the CGT event, the capital proceeds of $35,000.00 are replaced with the market value of the asset (Division 116, Capital Proceeds, Part 3-1, the 1997 Act, s 116-30(2)) and the cost base of the asset in the hands of the purchaser is the market value ($350,000.00).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Accordingly, when the shares were sold on 10 September 1999 by David and Rhondda Walters in their respective capacity as trustee of the relevant trust, the vendor of the share, it was said, did not realise a capital gain upon disposal of a CGT asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The Conclusions of the Tribunal 
 
43 In relation to the transactions, the Tribunal made these observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">[The applicants] say the shares were disposed of to [Sailpeal] and [Port Bracknell] on 13 April 1999 in return for shares in those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Those transactions were CGT events ... but the taxpayers elected in each case that [Subdivision 122-A] of the ITAA97 should apply.</sentence>

<sentence id="s164">On the face of it, the scheme appears to generate a tax benefit within the meaning of s 177C(1)(a) in that the operation of the scheme has resulted in an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer where it would otherwise be included.</sentence>

47 Apart from these factual conclusions, the Tribunal dealt with a contention on the part of the applicants that no tax benefit (having regard to the findings at [46] and [50] of the Tribunal's reasons) arose because s 177C(2)(a)(i) has the effect of excluding from the notion of 'an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer where that amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included', an amount where the non-inclusion is attributable to the taxpayer making a choice or election expressly provided for by the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Therefore, since each taxpayer made an election under Subdivision 122-A of Division 122 of Part 3-3 of the 1997 Act to obtain a 'roll-over' and the non-inclusion of $349,999.00 in the assessable income of each taxpayer in connection with the scheme so found, is 'attributable to the making of [a] choice or election (expressly provided for by [the 1997 Act])', the applicants did not, it is said, obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">48 The Tribunal concluded [50] that the tax benefit in question arose out of the 'subsequent steps in the scheme that led to an uplift in the cost base of the share' (in particular, the sale of the share by Adelong Hills as trustee of the Adelong Trust to Port Bracknell as trustee of the Dart Trust at the uplifted cost base of $350,000.00 in respect of the Dart Trading share originally held by David Walters and the sale of the share by Adelong Hills as trustee of the Adelong Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">2 to Sailpeal as trustee of the Dart Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">2 at the uplifted cost base of $350,000.00 in respect of the Dart Trading share originally held by Rhondda Walters), rather than the choice or election made by each taxpayer pursuant to s 122-15 of the 1997 Act in respect of the disposal by each taxpayer of their share in Dart Trading to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">49 In other words, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the non-inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer was 'attributable to' the choice or election made under s 122-15 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Accordingly, the applicants were 'unable to bring themselves within the exception provided for in s 177C(2)(a)(i)' [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Considerations 
 
50 At [39] the Tribunal concluded that neither taxpayer realised a capital gain consequent upon the disposal of each share as a result of 'the transactions they entered into'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Accordingly, neither taxpayer was required to include in his or her assessable income in the year ending 30 June 2000, an amount representing a realisation of a capital gain upon disposal of each share by reason of the transactions, by operation of Part 3-1 of Chapter 3 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">51 Rather, certain steps along the way to an ultimate sale of each share to Terrence and Annette Walters are said to constitute a scheme attracting the operation of Part IVA of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Tribunal's error of law is said to lie in the conclusion that neither taxpayer was entitled to the benefit of the 'choice or election' exclusion in s 177C(2)(a)(i) and, secondly, the application of that provision to the facts as found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">52 Section 177F(1) provides that where a tax benefit has been obtained or would but for s 177F be obtained by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which Part IVA applies, the Commissioner may, where the tax benefit is referable to an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income, determine that the whole (or part) of such an amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">53 A tax benefit in connection with a scheme, relevantly for present purposes, is a reference to an amount not included in 'the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income where that amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out' (s 177C(1)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">54 A scheme means, among other things, any arrangement, plan, course of action, course of conduct or scheme (s 177A(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">55 A scheme, so defined, to which Part IVA applies is one where a 'relevant taxpayer' has obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme and having regard to eight identified factors, it would be concluded that the person, or one of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme, did so for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme (or enabling the relevant taxpayer, another taxpayer or other taxpayers each to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme) (s 177D(a) and (b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">56 A reference to 'a scheme or part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by a person for a particular purpose' includes a reference to entering into or carrying out the scheme for two or more purposes of which 'that particular purpose is the dominant purpose' (s 177A(5)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">57 The eight factors which condition the conclusion contemplated by s 177D are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 (i) the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out; 
 
 (ii) the form and substance of the scheme; 
 
 
 
 (iii) the time at which the scheme was entered into and the length of the period during which the scheme was carried out; 
 
 (iv) the result in relation to the operation of this Act that, but for this part, would be achieved by the scheme; 
 
 (v) any change in the financial position of the relevant taxpayer that has resulted, will result, or may reasonably be expected to result from the scheme; 
 
 (vi) any change in the financial position of any person who has, or has had, any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) with the relevant taxpayer, being a change that resulted, will result or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme; 
 
 (vii) any other consequences for the relevant taxpayer, or for any person referred to in subparagraph (vi), of the scheme having been entered into or carried out; and 
 
 (viii) the nature of any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) between the relevant taxpayer and any person referred to in subparagraph (vi).</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 
 
 

58 Section 177D expressly contemplates that Part IVA applies to 'any scheme' where (having regard to subparagraph (a) and the eight identified factors in subparagraph (b)) it would be concluded that a person entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme for the identified purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Two steps are involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The first is to identify the scheme in connection with which the relevant taxpayer has obtained a contended tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The second is to identify whether a person has entered into that scheme or a part of that scheme for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">If the purpose is made out in relation to a part of the identified scheme, Part IVA applies to the scheme and not merely the part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">59 The Tribunal found [44] that the scheme comprised the series of transactions that preceded the ultimate sale of the share in each case, 'that is, all of the dealings up to but not including the actual sale of the shares to the in-laws'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Thus, the scheme was found, on the facts, to comprise the sequence of steps 'taken together' [44] commencing with the sale by each taxpayer of their Dart Trading share to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell and concluding with the last step taken prior to each taxpayer (as trustee) selling the relevant share to Terrence Walters and Annette Walters [43], [44].</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">60 Those findings were open on the evidence and are consistent with authority concerning the scope of the term 'scheme' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 425, McHugh J; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 225, Gleason CJ and McHugh J [9], Gummow and Hayne JJ, 236 [43], Callinan J, 250 [85]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">61 Plainly, the events of 13 --- 15 April 1999 are a sequence of steps comprising a course of conduct and involved the execution of the documents 'in a particular order' (AB388, para 10), supervised by the solicitor for the applicants (Mr Ian Collie --- AB387).</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">62 Was that scheme or any part of that scheme entered into or carried out for the dominant purpose required by s 177D?</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">63 The Tribunal identified that question as one of whether 'a reasonable person' would conclude that each taxpayer in entering into and carrying out the particular scheme had, as his or her 'most influential and prevailing or ruling purpose and thus [his or her] dominant purpose, the obtaining thereby of a tax benefit, in the statutory sense' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (supra) at 423, per the Court (supra)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">64 In considering each of the eight factors so as to determine whether a reasonable person would conclude that each taxpayer acted according to the most influential, prevailing or ruling purpose in the sense required by s 177D, the Tribunal was influenced by these findings in relation to the eight factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">65 As to factor (i) (see [57] of these reasons in each case), the applicants did not so much enter into a series of transactions as acquire a packaged solution from their solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The instructions required that each applicant execute a series of pro-forma documents over the course of a number of days [54].</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">66 As to factor (ii), the scheme involved the creation of a number of discretionary trusts in which the applicants continued to control ownership of the shares in the trustee company and no step was taken to notify Dart Trading of the change in the legal and beneficial ownership of the shares [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">67 As to factor (iii), the scheme was entered into in April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">At that time, each taxpayer was contemplating the sale of each share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Although an agreement to sell each share was 'still some way off, the sale was very much in prospect' [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">68 As to factor (iv), each taxpayer realised a tax-free gain for $349,999.00 on the sale of the share [57].</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">69 As to factor (v), each taxpayer improved their financial position by the amount of the tax saved through the scheme on the proceeds of the sale of their share [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">70 As to factor (vi), the applicants' professional advisers improved their financial position as a result of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">They were paid for their advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The other companies involved in the process did not experience a change in their financial position [59].</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">71 As to factor (vii), there were no other consequences apart from the gain derived by each taxpayer [60].</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">72 As to factor (viii), each applicant was a director of Sailpeal, Port Bracknell and Adelong Hills; David Walters was the sole shareholder in Sailpeal; Rhondda Walters was the sole shareholder in Port Bracknell; individuals associated with the legal advisers to each applicant were directors of the company that made the final distribution [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">73 Clearly, the Tribunal regarded the particular sequence of transactions making up the scheme; the role of particular trusts; the engagement of the applicants as shareholders and directors of particular entities; the package of documents, pro-forma content, immediacy of timing and execution ('flurry of activity' [62], [63]); the complexity of the transactions ('machinations' [29]) and a finding that each taxpayer entered into the transactions at a time when the sale of the shares to Terrence and Annette Walters was in prospect, as persuasive of a conclusion that a reasonable person would conclude that the 'only rational explanation' [62] (thus dominant purpose) for each taxpayer entering into the scheme was the obtaining of a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Each of the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its consideration of the eight factors was open to the Tribunal on the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">74 The applicants say that since neither applicant obtained a tax benefit for the purposes of Part IVA by reason of the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a) (discussed later in these reasons), no 'occasion' arose (since s 177D is said not to operate) to make findings that the arrangements 'were designed to reap a tax advantage upon the sale of the shares'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The applicants further say that steps forming part of a 'wider transaction', do not 'lead to a conclusion that the tax benefit said to have arisen is thereby cancelled'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">However, the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a) does not operate to remove the non-inclusion of the relevant amount from the operation of s 177C(1)(a), thus constituting a tax benefit for the purposes of s 177D (see [77] --- [89] of these reasons) and a finding of purpose in relation to the steps forming the scheme or a part of the scheme, applies Part IVA to the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">As to the question of no occasion arising to make relevant findings, once each taxpayer sought to rely upon the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a) a question of fact arose as to whether the contended non-exclusion of the relevant amount was attributable to the choice made by each taxpayer pursuant to s 122A of the 1997 Act or attributable to something else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">75 Section 177D operates on an hypothesis that a taxpayer has obtained (or would but for s 177F have obtained) a tax benefit in connection with the scheme and the dominant purpose informing the scheme is one of enabling the taxpayer to obtain that benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The hypothesis is that because, on the facts found, each taxpayer 'and their in-laws, were clearly anticipating a deal would be concluded' (for the reasons identified in the Tribunal's findings and summarised at [63]), each taxpayer would have sold their share to Terrence and Annette Walters respectively had not the scheme been entered into and carried into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">On such a hypothesis, each taxpayer would have realised a capital gain upon disposal of a CGT asset and that gain would have formed part of the assessable income of the taxpayer in the relevant year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">76 Accordingly, having regard to the eight factors and the alternative postulate ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (supra) at 243, Gummow and Hayne JJ [66]) open on the evidence, the Tribunal concluded as was open to it, that the dominant purpose of entering into and carrying out the scheme was to obtain a tax benefit of non-inclusion of the amount of a capital gain in the assessable income of each taxpayer that would have been realised upon disposal, as contemplated by s 177C(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">77 Each taxpayer says that no tax benefit arose in connection with the scheme and thus s 177D(a) is not satisfied with the result that Part IVA does not apply to the sequence of transactions found to be a scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In other words, s 177D falls at the threshold and Part IVA has no application to the sequence of transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">That result is said to arise because the statutory definition of a tax benefit contained in s 177C(1)(a) is subject to an express exclusion which removes the non-inclusion of a postulated capital gain from the assessable income of a taxpayer where the non-inclusion is attributable to the making of a choice or election expressly provided for by the 1997 Act (or the 1936 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">78 The relevant provisions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">
 SECTION 177C TAX BENEFIT 
 
 177C(1) [Obtaining a tax benefit] Subject to this section, a reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as a reference to: 
 
 
 (a) an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income where that amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out; or 
 
 
 
 (b) ... 
 
 
 and, for the purposes of this Part, the amount of the tax benefit shall be taken to be:

 ... 
 
 
 177C(2) [Exclusions] A reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as not including a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income not including an amount that would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the non-inclusion of the amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer is attributable to the making of an agreement, choice, declaration, election or selection, the giving of a notice or the exercise of an option (expressly provided for by this Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ) by any person, except one under subdivision 126-B, 170-B or 960-D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; and 
 
 (ii) the scheme was not entered into or carried out by any person for the purpose of creating any circumstance or state of affairs the existence of which is necessary to enable the declaration, agreement, election, selection, choice, notice or option to be made, given or exercised, as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">
 

79 Is the non-inclusion of a capital gain in the assessable income of each taxpayer in the year ending 30 June 2000 that would have been realised on 10 September 1999 upon disposal (in an amount of $349,999.00) had not the scheme been entered into and given effect, 'attributable to' the choice made by each taxpayer on 13 April 1999 to obtain a roll-over under subdivision 122A (s 122-15) in respect of the 'trigger event' of disposing of each share to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell, respectively?</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">80 The applicants say that no tax benefit arose for these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">81 The election by each taxpayer to choose a roll-over under subdivision 122A was an election expressly provided for by s 177C(2)(a)(i) of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The effect of the election was that Sailpeal and Port Bracknell took the 'rolled over' share subject to the cost base it had in the hands of each taxpayer ($1.00).</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">When each company made a disposal of the asset, the capital gain realised by that company (if any) would be calculated on the same cost base as each applicant thus preserving the tax treatment of that gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Neither applicant would be obliged to pay tax on any capital gain realised by Sailpeal or Port Bracknell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Whatever disposal occurred after the roll-over of the share into Sailpeal and Port Bracknell had no tax consequences for either applicant and therefore no 'tax benefit' arising out of any subsequent disposal could be obtained by either applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">82 The only tax benefit obtained by each applicant was the disregarding of any capital gain upon disposal of the share to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Since s 177C(2)(a)(i) expressly contemplated that election, neither applicant obtained a tax benefit for the purposes of Part IVA, by reason of the express exclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">83 The phrase in s 177C(2)(a)(i) 'attributable to' the particular election, choice or event means that there must be a direct relationship between the non-inclusion of the relevant amount and the choice or election made by the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Here, each taxpayer chose to obtain a roll-over within the framework of Subdivision 122A of the 1997 Act with the result that upon disposal of the share to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell a capital gain, otherwise realised in the hands of the taxpayer upon disposal of the CGT asset, 'is disregarded' (s 122-40).</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Had the Commissioner contended that the step of disposing of each share to the relevant entity constituted a disposal of a CGT asset giving rise to a realised capital gain in the hands of each taxpayer, the respondent would have been met with a complete answer under s 177C(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">84 However, the Tribunal concluded on the facts that each taxpayer entered into and carried out a scheme comprising a series of transactions including the sale or disposal of the share to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell in each case and the entire subsequent sequence of transactions leading up to the ultimate sale of the share to Terrence and Annette Walters by each taxpayer (in a trustee capacity) with the result, in part, that the cost base upon disposal of the asset at $350,000.00 did not give rise to a realised capital gain in the hands of the vendor, resulting in the subsequent distribution of the entire profit upon disposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The non-inclusion of the amount of $349,999.00 representing the capital gain that would have been realised in the hands of each taxpayer but for the scheme, is not attributable to the choice made by each taxpayer to obtain a roll-over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The non-inclusion is 'attributable to' the construct adopted by each taxpayer of a sequence of integrated and inter-dependent steps making up the scheme one of which was the initial disposal to Sailpeal and Port Bracknell, the subject of a choice by each taxpayer to obtain a roll-over for that step .</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">85 Accordingly, the Tribunal correctly determined that no nexus was made out between the choice or election made by each taxpayer and the non-inclusion of the amount of $349,999.00 in the assessable income of each taxpayer that would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Thus, the exclusion provided by s 177C(2)(a)(i) was not made out and each taxpayer obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a) and s 177D, enlivening the power of the Commissioner to make a determination pursuant to s 177F(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">86 There is no demonstrated error on the part of the Tribunal in the construction and application of s 177C(2)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">87 The Commissioner of Taxation makes a further submission that even if the non-inclusion of the relevant amount is attributable to the choice made by each taxpayer to obtain a roll-over, the scheme was nevertheless entered into or carried out by each taxpayer for the dominant purpose of 'creating any circumstance or state of affairs the existence of which is necessary to enable the ... choice ... to be made, given or exercised, as the case may be' and thus s 177C(2)(ii) is not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">88 At [49], the Tribunal found that each taxpayer '... did contrive to receive the proceeds of the sale of the shares to their in-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In particular, they each received $349,999.00 more than they paid for the shares in the first place'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The Tribunal described the sequence of transactions as a 'flurry of activity' between 13 to 15 April 1999 [62], [63] and characterised the transactions as 'machinations' [29].</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The conclusion that each taxpayer set in train a sequence of transactions as part of a scheme for the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit is consistent with the notion that each taxpayer entered into or carried out the scheme for the dominant purpose of creating the state of affairs necessary to prevent the realisation of a capital gain in the hands of each taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Section 177C(2)(a)(ii) seems to contemplate a taxpayer entering into or carrying out a scheme to bring about the circumstances to enable the roll-over choice to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Here, the taxpayer made the roll-over choice as part of a broader scheme to avoid the realisation of a capital gain in the hands of each taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">It may be difficult to conclude that the scheme was entered into or carried out for a purpose calculated to enable the roll-over choice to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Rather, the roll-over choice was the first step in a sequence of inter-related transactions making up a scheme for the dominant purpose of preventing the realisation of a capital gain upon disposal of each share by the vendor of that share to the ultimate buyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">89 It is not necessary to decide this question as each taxpayer has failed to satisfy the first limb of the exclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">90 The applicants raise a further matter in relation to Part IVA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The applicants say that s 177F enables the Commissioner to make a 'determination' which 'cancels the tax benefit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Section 177F(1)(a) does not use the phrase 'cancels the tax benefit' but rather confers a power upon the Commissioner to determine that the whole or a part of an amount not included in the assessable income of a taxpayer shall be included in the assessable income in the relevant year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">91 On 28 January 2004, the Commissioner made a determination in respect of each taxpayer that an amount of $350,999.00 being a tax benefit referable to an amount not included in the assessable income of the taxpayer in the year of income ending 30 June 2000 shall be included in the assessable income of each taxpayer for that year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The amount, of course, is incorrect and ought to be $349,999.00 in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The applicants say that the question is whether those determinations (AB98 and AB219) were authorised by Part IVA since the purpose found by the Tribunal is limited to some steps taken in a wider transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The applicants say that it is open to the respondent to rely upon alternative formulations as to the components of the scheme and to amend them; such alternative formulation raises the question of the dominant purpose of the parties to the scheme as thus formulated; there is no power in the Court to make or amend a s 177F determination; a different determination can only be made by way of an amended assessment; and having regard to the findings of the Tribunal, the conclusions are at odds with the Commissioner's position giving rise to the determination that the scheme resulted in the proceeds of sale not being included in the assessable incomes of the applicants under the capital gains tax provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The applicants say that having regard to the findings of the Tribunal, Part IVA determinations ought to have been made against the trustees of the Dart Trust and Dart Trust No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">2 and in effect, 'the Tribunal's findings seek to impute to a taxpayer who the Tribunal has found to be entitled to the benefit of a ... roll-over, the profit accruing ... to the subsequent owner [of the share]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">92 However, the position is that the Commissioner made determinations under the power conferred by s 177F(1) that the whole of the amount constituting a tax benefit obtained by each taxpayer in connection with the scheme having regard to s 177C(1)(a) shall be included in the assessable income of each taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The Tribunal found a scheme, as described in these reasons, to which Part IVA applies and in respect of which the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a) is not enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The Tribunal concluded that but for entering into and carrying out the scheme as found, an amount of $349,999.00 would have been included in the assessable income of each taxpayer being the capital gain realised upon disposing of the share by each taxpayer to Terrence Walters and Annette Walters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">That disposal was expressly in contemplation at the moment in time when each taxpayer embarked upon the series of transactions effected between 13 and 15 April 1999 and described in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Since the determination of the Commissioner rests upon the application of Part IVA as contemplated by s 177D and the findings of fact support a conclusion that each of the integers upon which that determination operates are satisfied, the Tribunal's findings do not have the effect of imputing to each taxpayer found to be entitled to the benefit of a roll-over election, the profit accruing to a subsequent owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The fundament of the Tribunal's finding is that each taxpayer participated in a contrivance or construct to implement a series of transactions to obtain a tax benefit which had the effect of removing from the assessable income of each taxpayer in the relevant year, a capital gain that would have been realised but for the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The imposition of additional tax by way of penalty 
 
93 The Commissioner imposed additional tax upon each taxpayer by way of penalty pursuant to s 226L of the 1936 Act and, in the alternative, pursuant to s 226 of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Those provisions were contained in Part VII of the 1936 Act and that Part was repealed from 14 September 2006 by the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Act 2006 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">However, the provisions governing the imposition of additional tax by way of penalty are those contained in Part VII of the 1936 Act at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">94 Section 226 is in these terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">
 226 Penalty tax where Part IVA applies --- general 
 
 (1) Where: 
 
 
 (a) for the purpose of making an assessment or arising out of the consideration of an objection, the Commissioner has calculated the tax that is assessable to a taxpayer in relation to a year of income; 
 
 
 
 (b) in calculating the tax assessable to the taxpayer, a determination or determinations made by the Commissioner under subsection 177F(1) was or were taken into account; and 
 
 (c) either of the following subparagraphs apply: 
 
 (i) no tax would have been assessable to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income if no determination had been made under subsection 177F(1) in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; 
 
 (ii) the amount of tax (in this section referred to as the amount of claimed tax ) that would, but for this section, have been assessable to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income if no determination had been made under subsection 177F(1) in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income is less than the amount of tax referred to in paragraph (a); 
 
 
 
 
 the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to: 
 
 
 
 
 (d) in the case to which subparagraph (c)(i) applies --- the penalty percentage of the amount of the tax referred to in paragraph (a); or 
 
 (e) in the case to which subparagraph (c)(ii) applies --- the penalty percentage of the amount by which the amount of the tax referred to in paragraph (a) exceeds the amount of claimed tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">
 
 (1A) ... 
 
 (2) In this section: 
 
 penalty percentage means: 
 
 (a) subject to paragraph (b) --- 50%; or 
 
 (b) if it is reasonably arguable that Part IVA does not apply --- 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">
 

95 As to the question of additional tax, the Tribunal reached these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">
 
 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The Commissioner imposed administrative penalties under s 226 [of the 1936 Act] equal to 50% of the tax shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">
 
 66.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Section 226 is applicable where a tax avoidable scheme has been struck down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Section 226(2) sets the penalty percentage ... at 50% unless it is reasonably arguable that Part IVA does not apply --- in which case the penalty percentage is 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">
 
 67.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">I think the applicants did have a reasonably arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The point they raised in relation to the effect of the election under s 122-A of the [1997 Act] was not easy to refute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">I think they are entitled to have the penalty percentage reduced to 25% in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">
 
 
 

96 As a result, the Tribunal set aside the decision to impose additional tax by way of penalty in an amount of 50% and substituted an amount of additional tax of 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The penalty percentage is set by the statute at 25% 'if it is reasonably arguable that Part IVA does not apply'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Section 222C provides, in relation to an income tax law:
 
 222C Reasonably arguable 
 
 (1) For the purposes of this Part: 
 
 
 (a) the correctness of the treatment of the application of a law; or 
 
 
 (b) another matter; 
 
 
 
 
 is reasonably arguable if, having regard to the relevant authorities and the matter in relation to which the law is applied or the other matter, it would be concluded that what is argued for is about as likely as not 
 
 
 
 

97 Section 177D determines whether Part IVA applies to a scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">The correctness of the treatment by the taxpayer of the application of Part IVA to the circumstances of the taxpayer is reasonably arguable if what is argued for is 'about as likely as not' [correct].</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The application of Part IVA, in this case, depends upon a consideration of a number of integers including whether the taxpayer has entered into or carried out a scheme; whether the taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme; whether having regard to eight factors, a reasonable person would conclude that the taxpayer entered into or carried out the scheme for the dominant purpose of enabling the taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit; and whether having regard to the notion of 'obtaining a tax benefit in connection with a scheme' the exclusion provided by s 177C(2)(a)(i) applies so as to exclude the non-inclusion of the relevant amount from the assessable income of the taxpayer in the year in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">98 The findings of the Tribunal are clear that each taxpayer entered into a scheme comprised of a series of transactions struck for the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit of excluding a capital gain of $349,999.00 from each taxpayer's assessable income that would have been realised upon a sale of each taxpayer's share to Terrence Walters and Annette Walters but for the implementation of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In that sense, the Tribunal found that each taxpayer had contrived to bring about that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Purpose is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Those findings were open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Accordingly, it seems to me that having regard to findings of fact the notion or argument of each taxpayer that he and she did not enter into or carry out a scheme for the dominant purpose of obtaining the identified tax benefit is not 'about as likely as not' correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Thus, the position taken by each taxpayer concerning those integers is not 'reasonably arguable'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">99 As to the integer influencing the question of whether Part IVA applies to the scheme as found, each taxpayer contended that no 'tax benefit' arose for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a) and s 177D(a) by operation of the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">However, since the non-inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer was not attributable to the roll-over choice made under subdivision 122A of the 1997 Act, each taxpayer obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme (s 177C(1)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">The scope of the exclusion is limited to the non-inclusion of the relevant amount directly attributable to the roll-over choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Since the Tribunal correctly found that the sequence of inter-related transactions between 13 --- 15 April 1999 comprising the scheme is the source of the non-inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer rather than the roll-over choice made under s 122-15 of the 1997 Act, it can be seen, having regard to the facts found, that the argument of the taxpayer concerning the construction and application of that integer is wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">However, that is not the end of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Even though the argument is incorrect, the question is whether the argument contended for by each taxpayer is one that could be argued, objectively, 'on rational grounds to be right' ( Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1 at 26 [108] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">100 The principles identified by Hill J, which apply with equal force to s 226 of the 1936 Act, are these ( Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation (supra) [108], propositions 1 to 7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">101 The test to be applied is an objective one; the comparison is one between the taxpayer's argument and the argument which is considered to be the correct argument; a determination must then be made whether the taxpayer's argument although considered wrong, is about as likely as not correct, when regard is had to the 'authorities' (including the income tax law, material for the purposes of s 15AB(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) and decisions of Courts, the Tribunal or a Board of Review) --- s 22C(4); it is not necessary that the taxpayer's argument, in an objective sense, is 'more likely to be right than wrong' as the taxpayer's argument will have been found to be wrong as an underlying premise; nor is it necessary that the taxpayer's argument is 'just as likely correct' as the principal argument will have been found to be wrong; the word 'about' indicates the need to balance two competing arguments so that 'on balance the taxpayer's argument can objectively be said to be one that while wrong could be argued on rational grounds to be right'; and:
 
 ... the view advanced by the taxpayer must be one where objectively it would be concluded that having regard to the material included within the definition of 'authority' a reasoned argument can be made which argument when contrasted with the argument which is accepted as correct is about as likely as not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">That is to say the two arguments, namely, that which is advanced by the taxpayer and that which reflects the correct view, will be finely balanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The case must thus be one where reasonable minds could differ as to which view, that of the taxpayer or that ultimately adopted by the Commissioner, was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">There must, in other words, be room for a real and rational difference of opinion between the two views such that while the taxpayer's view is ultimately seen to be wrong, it is nevertheless 'about' as likely to be correct as the correct view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">
 
 A question of judgment is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">
 
 

102 The Tribunal has not addressed itself to the principles governing the question of whether the argument advanced by the taxpayer is one which is sufficiently 'finely balanced' to be reasonably arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The Tribunal concluded that since the 'point raised', ([67] of the Tribunal's reasons) ie, the taxpayer's argument in relation to the effect of the election was 'not easy to refute' each taxpayer did have a reasonably arguable contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">103 The principles to be applied are those identified at [101].</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">104 It seems to me that the taxpayer's argument in relation to the construction and application of s 177C(2)(a)(i) is not objectively about as likely as not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Since the Tribunal has found that each taxpayer entered into and carried out a scheme comprising the sequence of identified transactions as a mechanism for bringing about a contrived avoidance or non-inclusion of a capital gain within the assessable income of the taxpayer, it is difficult to conclude on the question of attribution that the taxpayer's argument (ie, the non-inclusion of the relevant amount is directly attributable to the roll-over choice) is objectively, while wrong, capable of support on rational grounds to be right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The objective rationality of an argument of the taxpayer must be determined against the background of the findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Plainly, each taxpayer has formulated an argument which warrants analysis and evaluation in the context of whether each taxpayer has 'obtained a tax benefit' for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a) and thus s 177D having regard to the exclusion provision and the foundation facts upon which it operates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">However, having regard to the proper construction of the provision and application of the provision to the facts as found, the taxpayer's argument concerning attribution for the purposes of s 177C(2)(a)(i), when contrasted with the argument accepted as correct, is not about as likely as not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">105 Accordingly, the Tribunal fell into error in concluding that the taxpayer's contention was reasonably arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">106 In the result, the appeal by each taxpayer must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">107 The appeal by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the imposition of additional tax by way of penalty will be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The decision of the Tribunal with respect to s 226 of the 1936 Act will be set aside and in lieu thereof it will be ordered that the Commissioner's objection decision in respect of each taxpayer concerning the imposition of additional tax by way of penalty, be affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">108 As to the question of costs, the costs of the proceeding will be reserved as neither party has been heard in relation to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">I propose to direct that David Walters and Rhondda Walters file and serve submissions (if any) in relation to costs within seven days and the Commissioner of Taxation file and serve submissions within a further seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The Court will decide the question of costs on the papers.</sentence>
