1 On 13 June 2007, the Court delivered judgment ( Jakab v Repatriation Commission [2007] FCA 898) in an application by Mr Stefan Jakab pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') by way of an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('AAT') affirming a decision of the Repatriation Commission that Mr Jakab's Meniere's Disease diagnosed in 1995 was not related to his period of eligible defence service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr Jakab was unsuccessful in that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The application was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The costs of and incidental to the application were reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">An order was made that each of the parties file and serve any comments or submissions in relation to the question of costs by a certain date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The parties have provided those submissions in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I indicated that I would resolve the question of costs on the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 Mr Jakab says these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Mr Jakab took advice from solicitors in relation to the application to the Federal Court and says he was advised that his application had good prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On the day before the hearing, Mr Jakab was advised by counsel briefed by those solicitors that Mr Jakab had no prospects of success and that the application ought to be withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Jakab says that he had not been advised that his application lacked merits and he sincerely believed he had a proper basis for the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Jakab's solicitors sought and obtained leave to withdraw and Mr Jakab presented arguments in support of the application himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Jakab says he did not believe his arguments to be either frivolous or vexatious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Jakab says that he was not advised that in the event his application proved unsuccessful, a costs order could or might be made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 Mr Jakab says that he pressed arguments in support of the application which were independent of those identified by written submissions formulated by his former solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 Mr Jakab says that he has received legal advice that he might be entitled to pursue a remedy against his former solicitors but is unwell and not in a position to deal with the strain of what might be involved in taking such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Jakab says he has been very ill of late and has been hospitalised five times throughout 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Jakab says that his wife has a heart problem and he and his wife incur significant medical expenses in respect of Mrs Jakab's condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 Mr Jakab also says that he is experiencing significant financial difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He has no assets other than the residential home jointly owned by Mr and Mrs Jakab.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That property is mortgaged to the extent of $285,000.00 which requires monthly repayments of $1,800.00 per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">No further advances can be obtained from the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Jakab says that he has provided the Australian Government Solicitor with a schedule of his income and expenses which demonstrates that he has no disposable income after meeting basic living expenses incurred by both Mr and Mrs Jakab.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 Mr Jakab makes the point that he served with the Australian Defence Forces for 20 years and rendered service during the 'Indonesian Confrontation' and now undertakes voluntary work with the Vietnam Veteran's Association at the Sunshine Coast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">8 Mr Jakab invites the Court to exercise its discretion by refusing the respondent's application for an order that Mr Jakab pay the costs of and incidental to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 The Repatriation Commission contends that it was successful in the proceeding and that the discretion ought to be exercised according to settled principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The principles governing the exercise of the discretion are that a successful litigant is, prima facie, entitled to an award of the costs to which it has been put in responding to and dealing with a contention before the Court which is demonstrated to be unsound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">A successful party might be disentitled to an order for costs (or limited to an order for a proportion of the costs) if it has engaged in conduct which demonstrates some degree of contribution to either the level of costs incurred or a particular class of costs being incurred (such as costs relating to a particular issue).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The respondent says it ought to be awarded the costs unless it can be demonstrated it has brought about litigation; has done something connected with the institution of the suit calculated to occasion unnecessary litigation and expense; or has engaged in some wrongful act in the course of the transaction about which the claimant complains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">10 In this case there is no conduct on the part of the Repatriation Commission which would disentitle it to an award of costs against Mr Jakab.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The respondent has responded to an application made by Mr Jakab which lacked any merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The respondent conducted the response to the application properly and professionally and simply sought to demonstrate that the application lacked merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 It seems to me that there is no special consideration to be brought to bear in the exercise of the discretion based upon the recognition that the litigation is one between a citizen and an authority such as the Repatriation Commission or the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Nor is it a factor in the exercise of the discretion that the applicant is suffering financial detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">That detriment is not brought about by any conduct on the part of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In circumstances where the application pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act lacked merit and was therefore necessarily dismissed, the respondent is entitled to an order that Mr Jakab pay the costs of and incidental to the application to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">12 The Court notes that the respondent has the benefit of a discretion conferred upon it by s 206 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) and the respondent may consider taking steps under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">However, that question is entirely a matter for the respondent having regard to the relevant considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 

13 Accordingly, the Court orders the applicant to pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Associate:
