<sentence id="s0">
 By an application filed on 2 March 2007, the respondent, Les Laboratoires Servier ('Servier') sought to amend Australian Patent No 2001276418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The patent application was filed on 6 July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I found the proposed amendments allowable under s 102 of the Patents Act 1990 ('the Act') but, in the exercise of the discretion afforded by s 105 of the Act, declined to allow the amendments ( Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I indicated in my reasons that I considered it appropriate that Servier pay the applicant's costs of the application, which was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">However, as the parties had not made submissions on costs, I indicated that that order would be stayed to give the parties an opportunity to make submissions if they wished to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Servier submits that although the ultimate result was in Apotex's favour and Apotex is entitled to have costs of the hearing, it is appropriate to allow a discount in Servier's favour to account for Servier's success in relation to the allowability of the amendments under s 102.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Servier points out that the issues as to whether or not the amendments were allowable under s 102 of the Act were complex and involved evidence from two experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In those circumstances, where half of the hearing time concerned those issues, Servier submits that Apotex's entitlement should be discounted by 50%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">There are a number of reasons why, in my view, it is appropriate that Servier pay Apotex's costs, despite its success in establishing that the amendments are allowable under s 102: It follows that, in this case, it is appropriate that costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There is no need to make a further order for costs, as the stay on the order previously made will have automatically expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Associate:
