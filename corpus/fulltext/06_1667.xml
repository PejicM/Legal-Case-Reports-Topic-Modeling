<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Eric Byrne served in the Australian Army between April 1942 and February 1946.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">His service was "operational service" within the meaning of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act') and his widow applied for a war widow's pension pursuant to s 14 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mr Byrne died in November 1962 when his boat overturned during a fishing trip on Tantangara Dam in the Snowy Mountains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 A coronial inquiry found that Mr Byrne had died in a ' tragic accident ' and that the cause of his death was drowning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">That conclusion was adopted by the Repatriation Commission, which refused Mrs Byrne's claim for a pension, upon being satisfied that the veteran's death was not service related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Veterans' Review Board affirmed the Commission's decision, which was later affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( Byrne v Repatriation Commission [2006] AATA 416).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Mrs Byrne appeals the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Mrs Byrne put to the Tribunal that her husband suffered from ischaemic heart disease ('IHD') and coronary artery disease ('CAD'), each said to be war-caused conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was accepted by the Tribunal that Mr Byrne did suffer from CAD (at [66]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The issue in this appeal concerns the Tribunal's finding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that CAD was not a contributing factor to the death of Mr Byrne by drowning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Two grounds of appeal are pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Tribunal's finding that it was not satisfied that Mr Byrne suffered from IHD is not challenged and those parts of the notice of appeal which refer to IHD are not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The application of the correct test 
 
 4 Mrs Byrne relevantly posited to the Tribunal that her husband's ability to survive in the waters of Tantangara Dam when his boat overturned was impaired by war-caused CAD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Tribunal accepted that hypothesis to be reasonable (at [89]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">By s 120(1) of the Act, the applicant's claim was then required to succeed unless:
 
 &#8226; one or more of the facts necessary to support that hypothesis were disproved beyond reasonable doubt; or
 &#8226; the truth of another fact in the material, inconsistent with the hypothesis, was proved beyond reasonable doubt, 

thus disproving, beyond reasonable doubt, the accepted hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">( Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564 at 571; Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 91).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The second ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal failed to apply that test correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The complaint is said to arise from the final sentence in the Tribunal's reasons:
 
 'On the evidence, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne drowned, and that neither IHD nor CAD contributed to his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 

6 Mrs Byrne submits that, as a matter of construction, the Tribunal's satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt only applied to his death by drowning and that the Tribunal failed to apply the test as enunciated in Byrnes to the contribution of, relevantly, CAD to the death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 That submission is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal had already determined that the kind of death was drowning (at [57]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That was not in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is clear that the Tribunal understood that the question for determination was whether it was satisfied that the hypothesis that CAD had contributed to his death had been disproved beyond reasonable doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal set out the test as enunciated in Byrnes at [90].</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In that context and as a matter of construction, the requisite satisfaction expressed at [93] of the Tribunal's decision related directly to the contribution of CAD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Failure to give sufficient reasons 
 
8 The first and primary ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to refer to the evidence or other material that was the basis for its finding that CAD did not contribute to Mr Byrne's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mrs Byrne submits that the Tribunal gave no reasons or no sufficient reasons for that conclusion as required by s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">9 It is necessary to have some understanding of the context of the Tribunal's conclusion and the structure of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal considered the whole of the evidence before it, then gave its reasons and consideration under consecutive headings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 Under the heading '[c] onsideration of "kind of death" ' the Tribunal found that the "kind of death" was, on the balance of probabilities, drowning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal stated at [57] that it did not consider IHD or CAD was a "kind of death".</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It then proceeded to discuss the conflicting medical opinions about the kind of death and whether a cardiac event arising from CAD caused the death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In particular, it engaged in a detailed analysis of the evidence concerning the effect of IHD or a cardiac event arising from CAD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">At [64] --- [68] the Tribunal weighed the evidence on a cardiac cause of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Accepting that Mr Byrne had CAD (at [66]), the Tribunal was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was a cause of death or a "kind of death" (at [68]) for reasons that it gave by reference to the evidence and its assessment of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In summary, it referred to the two premises on which the opinions that there was a cardiac cause of death were based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Those premises were that the autopsy revealed that Mr Byrne had no water in his lungs and that he had made no effort to save himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Tribunal did not accept that either premise was correct, so that the opinions based on those premises were without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">11 The next heading in the decision reads '[i] s there a reasonable hypothesis connecting Mr Byrne's death with his service?</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' The Tribunal noted that, initially, two hypotheses had been advanced relating to malaria and IHD and that a third hypothesis was advanced during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">That hypothesis was, as I have noted, that CAD impaired Mr Byrne's ability to survive once he was in the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">No complaint is made about the Tribunal's treatment of the first two hypotheses in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">12 The Tribunal proceeded to consider the applicable principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There is no criticism of the statement by the Tribunal of those principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">13 Despite having concluded that it was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that CAD was a cause of death, the Tribunal reiterated the conclusions in the medical evidence in support of the third hypothesis that CAD was a cause of death and found that this was a reasonable hypothesis connecting Mr Byrne's death with his war service (at [88] --- [89]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">14 Mrs Byrne points to the Tribunal's finding at [66] that CAD was not a cause of death on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">She submits that this left open the possibility that the contribution of CAD to Mr Byrne's inability to survive once in the water was sufficient for the purposes of s 120(1) of the Act, to establish that the death was "war-caused" within s 8 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal did not, however, stop its analysis at that stage of its reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It rejected the premises on which the possibility was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It specifically considered whether it was satisfied that Mr Byrne's death did not arise out of a cardiac event and concluded, in the light of all of the evidence, that it was so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">15 The Tribunal acknowledged (at [90]) that, having found a reasonable hypothesis, Mrs Byrne's claim would succeed unless the hypothesis was disproved beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with the principles enunciated in Byrnes at 571 and noted in the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It then stated at [91]:
 
 'Having considered all the evidence, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne's death did not arise out of and was not attributable to a cardiac event of a kind described by Associate Professor Richards, Dr Craig, Dr Freeman or Dr Burn, that is, a cardiac event that was a consequence of IHD or CAD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">' 
 

That was the evidence considered in detail under the heading "consideration of the kind of death".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 The Tribunal expanded on that conclusion with respect to IHD at [92] and, at [93] said:
 
 'The opinions relating death to IHD and CAD were based essentially on there being no water in Mr Byrne's lungs and his "inability" to save himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Those opinions concluded that death was caused by such a cardiac event rather than by drowning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">On the evidence, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne drowned, and that neither IHD nor CAD contributed to his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">' 
 

'[T] he evidence ', as referred to in that paragraph, clearly refers back to the detailed discussion of the evidence earlier in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It was that evidence which disproved the hypothesis that Mr Byrne's ability to survive in the water was impaired by war-caused CAD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Conclusion 
 
17 There was detailed consideration of the evidence in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Tribunal cited that evidence as the basis for its conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The reasons explain how and why the Tribunal came to its conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It rejected the premises on which the hypothesis of CAD as a cause of death was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Once those premises were rejected, the hypothesis that CAD impaired Mr Byrne's ability to survive once in the water could not stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In context, it cannot be said that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, that the cause of death was drowning, to which CAD made no contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">18 The appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The applicant should pay the respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Associate:
