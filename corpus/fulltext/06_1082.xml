 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of Barnes FM of 6 April 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 23 February 2004 and handed down on 16 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Minister') made on 6 November 2003 to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant and his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant and his wife are citizens of India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They arrived in Australia on 7 August 2003 and applied for a protection visa on 2 September 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 1 December 2003 the appellant and his wife applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of the decision of the delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 In the protection visa application, and the matters before the Tribunal and Barnes FM, the wife, SZDGW, was an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">SZDGW also signed the notice of appeal filed 26 April 2006 which was before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However at the hearing before me, it was pointed out that the appellant was listed only as SZDGV, the husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In the case before me the first respondent consented to the wife being formally joined as an appellant, to avoid the circumstance that, should the husband succeed in the matter before me, his application would be remitted back to the Tribunal and the wife's application would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Accordingly, I order that SZDGW be formally joined as a second appellant in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Further, I note that the original respondent to this appeal is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Following the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) HCA 24 , I order that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as second respondent to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 The Tribunal's decision 
 
 5 No specific Refugees Convention claims were made by or on behalf of the appellant wife who relied on membership of the appellant husband's family unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In the protection visa application and before the Tribunal the appellant husband claimed a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of religion and political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He claimed that he was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ('BJP'), that he supported victims of the Gujarat train massacre and due to such support was persecuted by Muslim political parties and extremist Muslims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant husband claimed to have suffered property damage, to have been attacked resulting in hospitalisation and to have received threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 On 23 December 2003 the Tribunal invited the appellants to a hearing and on 13 February 2004 the Tribunal was advised in writing that the appellants did not wish to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The appellants did not attend the hearing and the Tribunal proceeded to determine the matter on the evidence available to it in their absence as permitted by s 426A Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 The Tribunal detailed a number of issues relevant to the evidence before it, in particular: &#8226; limited evidence and details as to membership or activities in the BJP &#8226; vagueness of claims concerning harm allegedly experienced at the hands of Muslim extremists &#8226; absence of detail as to threats to the life of the appellant husband &#8226; absence of detail as to the claim that the appellant husband was beaten up in his shop in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 The Tribunal found that the evidence before it was vague and lacking in detail in important respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It was unable to establish the relevant facts and consequently could not be satisfied the appellant husband was a member of the BJP, that he was ever attacked by Muslim extremists or that he and his family members were ever threatened by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It found the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 The Federal Magistrates Court 
 
 9 Before Barnes FM, the appellants claimed that: &#8226; the Tribunal did not properly assess the chance of persecution based on membership of a political party &#8226; the decision was made in bad faith &#8226; the Tribunal overlooked documentary evidence &#8226; the Tribunal did not observe the Act properly &#8226; the Tribunal failed to consider documentary evidence in the proper way &#8226; the Tribunal did not provide adequate particulars of independent information and denied the appellants an opportunity to respond to such information &#8226; there was denial of procedural fairness in that the hearing invitation letter was not properly served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 Barnes FM found that the Tribunal understood and considered the appellants' claims insofar as possible on the material before it and that there was no basis for the allegation of bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Federal Magistrate noted that merits review was not available in that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Her Honour found that the Tribunal need not have regard to documents that were not placed before it at the time of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Although the appellants annexed a number of documents to a further amended application, the Federal Magistrates Court did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the appellant husband was a refugee nor did the documents assist in determining whether the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Her Honour found no material to support the contention of irrationality or illogicality in the Tribunal's decision and any findings of vagueness and lack of detail were open to the Tribunal on the materials before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">11 The Federal Magistrate considered the ground regarding procedural fairness but found that no failure to comply with the procedures of the Act was established, nor was there a failure to provide the proper notification of the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal properly invited the appellant to a hearing by its letter dated 23 December 2003 consistent with its obligations under s 425 and s 425A of the Act, and the invitation was given pursuant to one of the methods specified in s 441A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Although there was evidence of an envelope being returned to the Tribunal which was addressed to the appellants' home address and mailing address, the Tribunal had received a completed response to hearing invitation indicating the appellants did not wish to attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Barnes FM was of the view that the Tribunal did not breach statutory obligations or err in deciding the application without taking oral evidence when the appellants declined the invitation to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 The Federal Magistrate addressed the remaining grounds and found that the Tribunal did not refer to any independent information in its reasons for decision and that there was no jurisdictional error on the part of Tribunal arising from the appellants' lack of English ability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Her Honour dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 Appeal to this Court 
 
 13 The notice of appeal to this Court raised the following grounds: &#8226; the Federal Magistrate failed to find jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision &#8226; the Tribunal erred in adopting 'an unduly approach to well-founded fear as the Tribunal was required to assess harm from the perspective of the persecutor' &#8226; the Tribunal did not properly consider the appellants' claims, including ignoring the appellants' evidence submitted with the protection visa application &#8226; there was denial of procedural fairness as the Tribunal adopted a harsh approach and did not give importance to the relevant issues &#8226; the appellants were not aware of the consequences of a failure to attend the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">14 At the hearing the appellant husband made the following submissions: &#8226; he was in Emerald when the Tribunal sent the letter about the hearing and his migration agent did not advise him that he had received a letter from the Tribunal until a week after the hearing had taken place &#8226; he is able to get proof of his membership of the BJP from India on BJP letterhead &#8226; he did not know what was in the documents when he was asked to sign the Tribunal documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">15 The first respondent, by way of both oral and written submissions, asserted the following: &#8226; no error is disclosed in the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate or the decision reached by the Federal Magistrate in dismissing the further amended application &#8226; the matters noted by the Tribunal were matters to which the Tribunal, as the arbiter of facts, can have regard &#8226; there is no basis on which the appellant husband can assert that the Tribunal ignored his evidence submitted to the Department with the protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">No jurisdictional error is disclosed &#8226; the Federal Magistrate dealt with the claim by the appellants that the Tribunal adopted a harsh approach and did not give importance to the real issues relevant to the appellants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">No error is disclosed in the way the Federal Magistrate dealt with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 The first respondent also drew the Court's attention to the issue of whether there had been a failure to comply with s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The first respondent submitted that there had not been a failure to comply with this section because the proper construction of the Tribunal's reasons is that the Tribunal was simply not satisfied of the relevant matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">17 On the facts of this case, no error in the decision of Barnes FM is evident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In particular, I note: &#8226; No particulars or other explanation are provided by the appellants as to how the decision of the Tribunal contains jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">&#8226; It was appropriate in the circumstances for the Tribunal to deal with the case (including the evidence) before it, in the absence of the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">&#8226; The appellants had appointed a migration agent to act on their behalf in relation to communicating with the Tribunal, and it was reasonable for the Tribunal to accept a communication from the migration agent to the effect that the appellants did not wish to attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">&#8226; Although the appellants state that they were unaware of the consequences of failure to attend the hearing, under the Act the substantive consequence is that the hearing can occur without the presence of the applicants: s 426A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">This consequence was communicated to the appellants by the Tribunal in its letter of 23 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The appellants have not indicated any other consequences which would be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">If the appellants expected that the hearing would not take place in their absence, in the absence of any other communication from them seeking a rehearing, such an expectation is unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">&#8226; Although the appellant husband claims that he is now able to produce a letter proving his membership of the BJP, the time to produce a letter of this nature, which goes to an issue of fact, was at or prior to the hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">If the appellants had required more time to produce this evidence, and accordingly sought a postponement of the hearing, an application to that effect could have been made to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">&#8226; Although the appellant husband claimed that he did not know what was in the 'Tribunal documents', I note again that a migration agent had been appointed to assist both appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There is no evidence before me that the appellants were mislead by the migration agent they had appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">18 The appellants claim that the Tribunal did not properly consider their claims, including ignoring their evidence submitted with the protection visa application, and that the Tribunal had adopted an unduly harsh approach to their case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In my view, there is no evidence of this in the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Rather, the reasons for the decision indicate that the case submitted by the appellants to the Tribunal was vague and lacking in the necessary detail to persuade the Tribunal that the appellants are persons to whom Australia owes protection obligations within the Refugees Convention and the Refugees Protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Clearly, it is for the appellants to make a case that they are in need of protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In my view, this case demonstrates, again, the importance of those in the position of the appellants both explaining their case in as much detail as possible to the Tribunal, and actually appearing at the hearing in order to explain their case and answer any questions the Tribunal may need to ask.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">19 In my view the appropriate order is that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 1.</sentence>
