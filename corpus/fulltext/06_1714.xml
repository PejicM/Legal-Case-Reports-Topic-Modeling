1 This is an application for an order nisi requiring the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to show cause why relief by way of constitutional writs and injunctions should not be granted following a decision of the Tribunal to refuse to grant a protection visa to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">For an order nisi to issue it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate that he has an arguable case for the final relief sought by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This matter has been referred to this Court by order of the High Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Court has decided to proceed ex parte on the basis that O 51A r 5(1) of the Federal Court Rules does not apply (see O 51A r 5(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The applicant's claim to be entitled to a protection visa was rejected by the Tribunal for reasons which overwhelmingly related to his credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The Tribunal accepted that the applicant is an Ahmadi from Bangladesh notwithstanding that he had travelled to Australia on an Indian passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It accepted independent evidence, which it set out in its written reasons for decision, that although there were isolated instances in the early 1990s when Ahmadi institutions in Bangladesh were attacked by fundamentalists, attacks have ceased as the Government had made clear that it would not accept them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Tribunal found that Ahmadis are free to practice their religion openly and find it no bar to achieving high status in life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Tribunal rejected the applicant's claim that he was subject to persecution in Bangladesh for being an Ahmadi or for having married into an Ahmadi family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant's particular claims regarding adultery accusations, having a grenade thrown into his house, being beaten and being falsely charged with smuggling were credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It found that he was prepared to invent scenarios to suit his convenience noting, by way of support, that he had admitted being untruthful with both the Indian and Bangladeshi authorities and had made, but when challenged not persisted with, an unsustainable claim before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 The Tribunal summarised its conclusions concerning the applicant in the following way:
 
 'I find that the applicant's evidence is evasive, lacks credibility and is unsupported by independent evidence on the treatment of Ahmadis in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I am not satisfied that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for the reasons he claims in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I am of the opinion that he came to Australia for reasons other than a need to seek protection from persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 

6 The applicant claims to have been denied procedural fairness because he does not believe that the Tribunal looked at all of the material relating to his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The letter inviting him to attend a Tribunal hearing asserted that the Tribunal had looked at all of that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The material, as listed in Part B of the record of the decision made by the Minister's delegate, was constituted by the Department's file, certain DFAT cables, DFAT's country profile for Bangladesh dated July 1994, certain reports and briefing papers on Bangladesh and Professor Hathaway's treatise on the Law of Refugee Status .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant asserts that, as a consequence of being misled into thinking that the Tribunal had that material, he 'did not take steps to bring to its attention those parts of the documents or other similar material which favoured [his] claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
7 There is no evidence before the Court which provides support for the applicant's belief that the Tribunal did not, as it claimed, look at all material relating to his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Equally importantly the applicant has not identified any aspect of the relevant publications, or other material in existence at the date of the Tribunal's decision, which he would have brought to the Tribunal's attention had he not received the Tribunal's letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 The Tribunal's decision was not founded on any of the material listed in Part B of the record of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The independent country information upon which the Tribunal relied in reaching its decision was, with one minor exception, published after the date of the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The applicant has not suggested that the substantive content of this material was not drawn to his attention during his Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 At the hearing of this application the applicant has placed before the Court material concerning the situation of Ahmadis in Bangladesh which post-dates the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">This material does not provide any support for the applicant's claim to have been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Nor does it otherwise suggest error affecting the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I have refused a request from the applicant to give him further time to find supporting material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Bearing in mind that his application to the High Court was filed on 21 May 2003 I am satisfied that the applicant has had more than sufficient time to gather together material he wishes to rely on to support his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">10 Nor do I accept the applicant's submission that his case should be reheard by the Tribunal because he did not feel especially well in front of the Tribunal and was not in a good condition to put his case to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This issue is not identified in his application or either of his affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I am not satisfied, in any event, that any error has been shown to affect the Tribunal's decision to proceed with its hearing when it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal, which had previously adjourned a hearing to suit the applicant's convenience, noted that the applicant had a cold and made allowance for his illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 
 
I am satisfied that the applicant has not established an arguable case for the issue of an order nisi directed to either of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The orders nisi sought by this application are refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Associate:
