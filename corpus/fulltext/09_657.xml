<sentence id="s0">
 The applicant, Linda Yousif, filed this application on 20 February 2009 following the termination of her employment by the respondent, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Bank) which occurred on 8 December 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Ms Yousif alleges that the Bank terminated her employment contrary to s 659(2)(a) and/or (e) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the Act) which provides that: 
 an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for any one or more of the following reasons, or for reasons including any one or more of the following reasons: 

 
(a) temporary absence from work because of illness or injury within the meaning of the regulations;
 
 
...
 
 
(e) the filing of a complaint, or the participation in proceedings, against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations or recourse to competent administrative authorities; 
 
 Proof of the case is governed by s 664 which, relevantly, provides: 
 (a) it is not necessary for the employee to prove that the termination was for a proscribed reason; but 

 
 (b) it is a defence in the proceedings if the employer proves that the termination was for a reason or reasons that do not include a proscribed reason... 

 The only issue in dispute is whether the Bank has established a defence under s 664(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Bank contended that the reason for the termination was as expressed in the letter of termination as follows: 
 As you are aware, the Bank recently wrote to you regarding your return to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">During the court proceedings on 7 November 2008, you confirmed through your evidence to the Court that you did not trust the Bank and senior managers in the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Further, you confirmed that you therefore could not return to work with the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">

 
 As you must appreciate, your employment with the Bank cannot continue in circumstances where there is no longer a relationship of mutual trust and confidence and you have clearly indicated that you do not wish to return to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In these circumstances, the Bank has also come to the view that your return to work is no longer a viable option given the employment relationship between yourself and the Bank has irretrievably broken down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">

 THE FACTS 
 Ms Yousif worked for the Bank as a mobile lender in the Western Victoria / Tasmania Region (Western Region).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Her job was to persuade customers to take out home loans with the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She was successful in attracting a high volume of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">As her figures increased she sought additional administrative assistance from the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Initially some further assistance was provided, but towards the end of 2007 her further request was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">She then attempted to transfer as a mobile lender to the Personal Relationship Banking (PRB) division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Grahame Carney, the Executive General Manager, Branch and Relationship Banking determined that the position was not available due to a restructure of mobile lending in PRB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The refusal of the Bank to allow Ms Yousif to move to PRB generated great controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Ms Yousif went on sick leave in about the end of March 2008 as a result of the stress caused by the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Then, on 30 May 2008 she filed proceeding VID 394 of 2008 in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In that proceeding she alleged that the Bank acted in breach of her contract of employment by refusing to allow her to transfer to PRB, and also acted in breach of her contract of employment in the way in which it conducted the investigation into the decision to refuse to allow her to transfer to PRB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A detailed account of that controversy is contained in the reasons for judgment published in application VID 394 of 2008 ( Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 2) [2009] FCA 656), and, it is not necessary to repeat those details in this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Rather that account should be read as incorporated in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">However, some aspects of particular relevance to this application should be related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In VID 394 of 2008 on 2 June 2008 the Bank gave undertakings to Gray J that until further order: 
 (i) it will not dismiss the applicant from her employment; and 

 
 (ii) it will continue to pay to the applicant her usual salary without requiring her to perform duties or offering to provide her with duties to perform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

 The hearing of application VID 394 of 2008 commenced on 6 November 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Ms Yousif was called as the first witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She was cross examined on 6 and 7 November 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">At the end of the cross examination at about midday on 7 November Mr M McDonald, who appeared as senior counsel for the Bank, asked some questions concerning Ms Yousif's attitude to returning to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">She made it clear in her answers that the relationship with the Bank had completely broken down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is best to let Ms Yousif's own words describe her position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">She said in response to questions in cross examination: 
 I'm putting to you that from 13 February, the certificates that are in evidence from your doctors expressly say that barrier to you returning to work is that you're in the Western Region and that you should be relocated out of the Western Region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That's what your doctors say?---And he said I understand there is ongoing legal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

 
 So, it's the fact that the ongoing legal proceeding has not been resolved, that's what --- that's your evidence - - -?---No, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

 
 That's what's stopping you from going back to work?---No, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Because all these bullying and harassment which affect on my health and also there are all these unresolved issue and the treatment that I had from management and also when I took this matter to senior that has not been dealt through --- fairly, this has even affect more on my level of stress and my family life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">And on top of that, it did not stop to here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The bank went way too far with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They wanted to get rid of my altogether and I've seen that termination letter that - - - 

 
 The bank has offered you ongoing work - - - 

 
 ... 

 
 THE WITNESS: Mr Carney want me just to forget about everything happen overnight and just --- he --- I received this letter just before 1 o'clock, it was about 12 --- it might come about 12, 12.30 and he just want me to attend to work on the 6 th , which was this Monday, at 9 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">So he expect me to have four hours to forget about everything and --- I get all my health back, all the stress sorted out all in just four hours and just come back to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">

 
 MR M McDONALD: The bank was giving you what you had been asking for, for seven months, Ms Yousif, a transfer out of - - -?---But after damage had already - - - 

 
 - - - the Western Region into the Eastern Region?- - - been done, Mr McDonald.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The damage already done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

 
 HIS HONOUR: But then, Ms Yousif, what is it that the bank can do, apart from giving you what you want by way of a transfer, and let's assume that some resolution was made to the period you have been on sick leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In terms of the ongoing issues for you, what more can the bank do, you want them to sack Mr Porter or sack Mr Carney and Mr Gwynne and --- I mean, what's the realistic position that you're actually putting?---Sorry, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">How do you want me to trust these people again?</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
 Well then you wouldn't want to go back to the bank, would you?---If the --- if all these issues are raised in my letter on 15 September and if my health helped me to get back to the same and work with these people again, yes, I will.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">But I can't see that I have a future with this bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">That my --- how can Mr Carney fix?</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Is he going to go and run another teleconferences to management in all Australia and say, I was --- I made a wrong decision, Linda was never should've been sacked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Linda did --- Andrew Matthews has signed that letter and we called him to lie and therefore to find an excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Is he going to tell my story?</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">My file, your Honour, has been filled with all this complaint and diary note that I have no idea about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Anywhere I go with the bank, any management want to take me, they going to look at my files, what's my history of employment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">And my name absolutely been blackened in that file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">

 
 ... 

 
 Well, don't let's get into the detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Let's just try and isolate the issues which you say are still outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">You've been given the transfer, there's the blackening of your name by linking you with a forgery which you say is a false accusation?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">

 
 All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">What else is there, there's the question of your --- if you were to leave the bank, how they would represent you to other employers?---And my clients and my referral source and what will happen with the - - - 

 
 Well, that's only if you stay at the bank but the way you're talking, it seems as if the likelihood that you're going to be happy at the bank is remote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">If you don't trust all these people, how would you ever want to go back?---Well, that's my point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I'm saying they've done damage that cannot be resolve and it came way too late.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Mr Carney, he said in his letter of 3 June that he investigated the matter and he was in a position to dismiss me, when he really did not investigate the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">

 
 ... 

 
 MR M McDONALD: Can I just ask you a very simple question?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 
 Do you want to go back to work?---I can't.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

 
 There's a job for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It's waiting there for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It's been an offer made in good faith to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Do you want to go back to the bank and be an employee of the bank?---I don't believe, Mr McDonald, your clients have good faith because I don't trust --- after what happened to me I do not trust that they had any good faith in any decision they made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">

 
 So is the answer no, you don't want to go back?---I cannot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I want to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I wish if you could bring the time that it's January again and I could get the same job, but during the last 10 months the bank has caused major damages, damages to my reputation, to my client base, to my future, not only with the bank but to my future elsewhere as well if I go and do this lending elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">

 On 8 December 2008 the Bank applied to be released from the undertakings which it had given to the Court on 2 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The application was granted ( Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1948) partly on the basis that Ms Yousif's evidence on 7 November 2008 indicated that she could no longer work for the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Then on the same day the Bank terminated Ms Yousif's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The only evidence given in relation to the present application concerned the reasons for the termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Mr Carney had made the decision to dismiss Ms Yousif.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In examination in chief he explained the reason as follows: 
 The termination decision was made simply because Ms Yousif stated in that very court that there was an irretrievable breakdown of relationship between her and her employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She didn't trust the Bank and she didn't trust the senior executives of the Bank; and, therefore, I took that as an irretrievable breakdown and I took the --- the decision to terminate the services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">

 He denied that one of the reasons for the termination was that Ms Yousif was temporarily absent from work due to illness, and he also denied that one of the reasons was that she had participated in the proceedings she brought against the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Millar, who appeared as counsel for Ms Yousif, fastened upon an answer given by Mr Carney in cross examination as evidence that one reason for the termination was that Ms Yousif was absent from work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The exchange was as follows: 
 If Ms Yousif had said what she did in the workplace, if she'd had an outburst one afternoon at work and said words to the effect of, "I don't want to work here any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I don't trust these people," would you have immediately dismissed her?</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Or would you have sat down with her later to talk through the issues, to see if they could be resolved?---It's somewhat hypothetical, but I would treat every case on its merits, and I would want to understand the issues that --- that triggered the outburst, and the circumstances around it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">But I want to reiterate, the termination action that I took, and outlined in my letter that's before the courts, was not on an isolated issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I had done my best, as I considered it, to get Linda Yousif back to work, and I have outlined the process I took and the steps I took over the period of time I took it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">

 Mr Millar argued that Mr Carney's reference to Ms Yousif's evidence that the relationship with the Bank had broken down not being an isolated issue meant that Mr Carney had other reasons for the dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Mr Carney's immediately subsequent reference to trying to get Ms Yousif back to work demonstrated that one reason for the dismissal was Ms Yousif's temporary absence from work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This evidence was given in response to questions in cross examination suggesting that Mr Carney would not dismiss an employee simply because the employee expressed the view that they could not work for the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Carney explained that he did not take the evidence given by Ms Yousif in isolation when deciding to terminate her employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He viewed the issue against the history of his attempts to get her back to work first by offering her a different manager in the Western Region, and then offering her a transfer to the Eastern Region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He thought he had tried all reasonable options to meet Ms Yousif's requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">When she indicated in Court that, despite those efforts, she did not trust the Bank or its senior executives, Mr Carney was in the position which he described thus: 
 I just didn't know where else I could go, and given the breakdown, which I considered to be irretrievable, I took the decision that I did and communicated that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">

 The background to which Mr Carney referred emerges from correspondence between Mr Carney and Ms Yousif which begins with a letter from Mr Carney concerning several disciplinary issues involving Ms Yousif which had been investigated by the Bank at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Carney wrote a letter dated 19 August 2008 which included the following: 
 Your Continuing Employment 

 
 The issues with respect to your ongoing employment with the Bank remain unresolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I want to do what I can to resolve them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">

 
 The Bank does not propose to take any disciplinary action against you in relation to the matters raised in my letter dated 5 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">

 
 On the issue of the forged signature, I do not know who is telling the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I have conflicting sworn testimony between you and Andrew Matthews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As such, I cannot be satisfied that you should be dismissed on that account alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">

 
 On the issue of the manipulation of the VLOC bonus system, in fairness to you, it is an issue which extends beyond your own actions to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">However, you should be on notice that in future the Bank will exercise a zero tolerance approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The operation of the Bank's mobile lending functions, especially in Victoria and Tasmania, are going to be very closely managed and supervised including by me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Interference with, or manipulation of the Bank's systems and protocols by mobile lenders and others will cease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">More specifically, your actions in this respect to date will not in and of themselves result in the termination of your Contract of Employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">However, you should be in no doubt that in the future manipulation of the VLOC/Bonus system will be treated as a most serious breach of employment obligations which is likely to lead to instant dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I propose making this fact plain to all relevant staff as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">

 
 As a consequence, I propose that, once you have medical clearance from your treating doctors, you return to work in a position of mobile lender reporting to Keith Osborne [a different manager in the Western Region].</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">

 
 There is another matter that I would like you to seriously consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I am concerned that your focus on work has operated to the detriment of your health and is not in your interests or indeed those of the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I suspect that this led to the behavioural issues raised with you by Richard Porter, in relation to your dealings with clients and colleagues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">We need you to regain perspective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">With this in mind, I invite you to participate in the Bank's Employee Assistance Program to work out the best way of balancing you work and family commitments, and avoid becoming obsessive about your work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">

 
 You have not been offered the position of Mobile Banker --- Personal Relationship Banking because as I advised you in our telephone conversation in late January 2008 I had determined the position was not to be filled due to restructuring decisions I had under active consideration at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The position no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">

 Ms Yousif replied on 25 August 2008 as follows: 
 I was pleased to receive your letter of 19 August 2008 and I look forward to returning to my role of Mobile Banker as soon as I can obtain a health clearance from my doctor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">

 
 I trust you are aware of the issues that I have had with Mr Porter and if you have any doubts about any matter I would be pleased to provide you with the information that you may need.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I never had a problem coping with my workload until I was bullied and harassed by Mr Porter and suffered a lack of support from Mr McKinnon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">However, it is my hope that past issues can be put behind us and that a new start can be made going forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">

 
 To do this will require some compromise on behalf of myself and I will need the support of the Bank as described below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">

 
 To ensure that there are no ongoing problems between myself and Mr Porter, or anyone in his management line, please authorise a transfer of my position to either the Eastern Region or Personal Relationship Banking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I am aware that many other Mobile Bankers have moved seamlessly between regions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">

 
 I will give you my utmost cooperation in ensuring that there is no disruption in the transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I usually work from home and my clients are, as you know, not territory bound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">I have complied with the Bank's directions that I am entitled to treat my role as a business and recruit from referral work resulting from good service to wherever those referrals may lead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">

 
 As part of my goodwill towards the Bank, I have instructed my lawyers to seek a prompt resolution of any matters which may remain outstanding under my Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It would be highly desirable that I not be involved in any litigation with the Bank whilst working hard for the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Nor, would I want to take any time off work to prepare for my legal case or be distracted by my legal case when I can be engaged in my preferred preoccupation, winning business for the Bank as a Mobile Banker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">

 
 Perhaps it may be a good idea if we enjoyed a private, informal meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">There is no need for the airing of any disparaging remarks if you can personally assure me that I have a bright future with the Bank in the mobile lending area, which is my passion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">

 In response, Mr Carney wrote on 3 September 2008: 
 Your continuing employment 

 
 I am writing in response to your letter dated 25 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">

 
 At this time, I do not think matters can be advanced by our meeting privately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I am also concerned since it appears to me that you believe that your return to work is something that should be negotiated between us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">

 
 Based on the information you have provided and the investigation already carried out, I do not believe that issues you raised regarding Richard Porter allegedly bullying and harassing have been substantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">

 
 Further, I am not confident, having regard to your letter, that you accept that there are any issues arising out of your behaviours that you need to take responsibility for and address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In my opinion there are and they include: 

 
 (a) your manipulation of the VLOC system inappropriately to secure additional remuneration for yourself: 

 
 (b) threatening your managers that you will move to another region if work and bonuses are not allocated in the way you would like; 

 
 (c) your failure to follow a clear direction from your manager about allocation of work by entering into an agreement with another employee contrary to this direction; and 

 
 (d) performance issues around your behaviours and service standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">

 
 You have asked for my personal assurance that you have a bright future with the Bank in the mobile lending area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Linda, this entirely depends on your actions, behaviours and compliant business outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">

 
 With due respect, none of my concerns have anything to do with the complaint you have made to Mr Norris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">It is important that you understand that there are behavioural issues that you need to take accountability for and address upon your return to work and they will not be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I am prepared to give you every opportunity to succeed but if your unacceptable behaviours continue, I will take appropriate disciplinary action as is normal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">

 
 In my earlier letter, I invited you to participate in the Bank's Employee Assistance Program in order to achieve work life balance, a proper perspective on your role with the Bank and to deal with any behavioural issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">I again encourage you to agree to undertake the Employee Assistance Program upon your return because in my view, you have become 'obsessive' about your work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">For example, you continued to undertake work including logging onto your PC and making business calls whilst you were on sick leave and were not fit to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">

 
 Before you can return to work, we need to ensure that you are fit to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Accordingly, could you please obtain medical evidence as to whether you are fit to return to work by Tuesday 9 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Alternatively, if you are not presently fit to return to work, the report must state when you are likely to be fit to return to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

 This letter provoked a long response from Ms Yousif on 15 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It is not necessary to reproduce the entire letter however its contents and tone are illustrated by the following extracts: 
 I must say with all my respect that your letter dated 3 September was very poor and made me realise that you care factors are absolutely zero and I will never have any support from you and the Bank on my return to work and also by you rejecting my offer of a private meeting to sort some of the issues just proved to me that you refuse to make peace and insisting on running the war against me and this is exactly what was prescribed by Justice Gray when he made his orders on 2 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 
 I have done the right thing by my clients and the Bank and the issue you are raising on your letter dated 3 September 2008 

 
 ... 

 
 b) Threatening management - this is exactly vice versa of what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The management have threatened me verbally first and then they carried out the threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Richard Porter did this in late night calls in the week 18 --- 23 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Particularly the call he made to me on 23 January 2008 when he told me that he would destroy my career with the Bank and to circle today's date in my calendar and my career will finish here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">I have done the right thing by you and by senior management by escalating my complaint through the correct procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">You decided to stick with Richard Porter and help him to put his threat to practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">You proposed to me in your letter dated 3 June 2008 that a decision was made to dismiss me from my employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Luckily for me this was stopped by a court action dated 2 June 2008 by Justice Gray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Western region or eastern region or even personal relationship banking departments all belong to the bank, so tell me where is the threat to you when you manage all the three departments?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The reason behind my decision to leave western region initially was because of the lack of support from management and the favouritism rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">I would like to remind you about the PRB's mobile banker's role which was already officially offered to me in mid Jan 2008 and you have withdrawn the offer late Jan 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The bank already admitted this fact in their summary report investigation by Kerrie Blundell in March 2008 (known to court as Doc LY-1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The big fact that you know and I know and everyone else in the bank was that Richard Porter did not want to release me from his region because I was the second highest top sales performer in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Leaving him meant effecting on his personal bonus and overall on his sales lending results which was not going to make him look good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">

 
 ... 

 
 d) There has been absolutely no performance issue around my behaviour that I was made aware of and if Richard Porter and Cameron McKinnon are going to make any story I am sure was after my email to the CEO Mr Ralf Norris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The serious behaviour issue that needs your attention and the bank is Richard Porter and Cameron McKinnon unacceptable behaviours which is highly effecting on the bank's reputation, for example running their drinking sessions during business hours and interrupting work and running their personal affairs at work and during business hours with the staff that they directly managing, misusing their management's position to take advantage of their staff and those workplace romances are effecting on other staff and clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">They are not appropriate and not professional plus it is a conflict of interest when making decisions and they always put their lovers at favourite positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">This is breach of the bank's statement of professional practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">

 
 I have asked you for your personal assurance that I have a bright future with the bank because since everyone start fighting me the minute they knew about the email I have send to the CEO on the 20/02/2008 and every action was taken since then was threatening to my career with the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">For example: 

 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">All your threatening letters from March - June 2008, specifically in your letter dated the 3 rd June 2008 which was stopped by the court order 02/06/2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">How could a man with your experience and position with the bank decided to dismiss me from my employment because Andrew Matthews has denied signing letter dated 24/12/2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Have you ever thought about the legal position you are putting your employer through or you just wanted to stick with Richard Porter and discriminate me and victimize me.</sentence>

<sentence id="s203">Neither of them constituted a reason for the dismissal, let along an operative reason.</sentence>
