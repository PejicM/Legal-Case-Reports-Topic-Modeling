 THE DISPUTE 
 The parties
 This proceeding involves two aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant, Geoffrey Harper, owns a Piper Navajo Chieftain, registration number VH-ONC (aircraft ONC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mr Harper holds a pilot's licence but his principal business is running a coach company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">After purchase in February 2005 Mr Harper brought aircraft ONC to Bankstown airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The third respondent, TS Air Charter Pty Ltd (TS Air Charter), owns a Piper Navajo Chieftain registration number VH-TSO (aircraft TSO).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Aircraft TSO is also located at Bankstown airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The second respondent, Steven Hobson, is the director of both TS Air Charter and the first respondent, Reg-Air Pty Ltd (Reg-Air).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr Hobson is a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer (referred to as a LAME in the aircraft industry).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He is employed as chief engineer by a company known as AirAg Aviation Services Pty Limited (AirAg).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">AirAg operates out of Bankstown airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">AirAg is not a party to this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Harper's claims
 Mr Harper claims damages from Reg-Air, TS Air Charter and Mr Hobson in the amount of $165,342.50 and exemplary damages of $60,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Harper's claims are as follows: The express representations
 
 (1) During discussions between Mr Harper and Mr Hobson in April 2005 Mr Hobson, as agent for Reg-Air, represented that he was "an authorised aircraft engineer" and it would take Reg-Air or Mr Hobson "four months to get [Mr Harper's] aircraft [ONC] into the air" (the express representations).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">During the hearing, Mr Harper accepted that Mr Hobson was in fact "an authorised aircraft engineer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">(2) In reliance on the express representations Mr Harper agreed to retain Reg-Air to provide services for repair, maintenance and servicing of aircraft ONC (the agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">(3) In breach of the express representations Reg-Air failed to get aircraft ONC into the air within four months or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The implied representation
 
 (4) It was an implied term of the agreement between Mr Harper and Reg-Air that the services provided for aircraft ONC would comply with all requirements of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth) and Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 (Cth) (the implied representation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">(5) In breach of the implied representation, Reg-Air and Mr Hobson did not comply with all of the requirements of the Civil Aviation Act and Civil Aviation Regulations (including by reason of tampering with aircraft ONC and keeping inadequate records).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The implied warranty
 
 (6) It was an implied warranty of the agreement between Mr Harper and Reg-Air that the services would be rendered with due care and skill and that any materials supplied in connexion with those services would be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were supplied within the meaning of s 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">(7) In breach of the implied warranty the services were not rendered with due care and skill and the materials supplied in connexion with those services were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Damages arising from statutory claims
 
 (8) The express representations and implied representation were conduct of Reg-Air likely to mislead or deceive within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and by which Mr Harper suffered loss and damage compensable under s 82 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">(9) Alternatively, by the express representations and implied representation, Reg-Air falsely represented (within the meaning of s 53(aa) of the Trade Practices Act ) that the services to aircraft ONC would comply with the Civil Aviation Act and Civil Aviation Regulations when they did not and by which Mr Harper suffered loss and damage compensable under s 82 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">(10) By Reg-Air's conduct in breach of the implied warranty, Mr Harper suffered compensable loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Trespass, conversion and damages
 
 (11) Mr Hobson, as director, servant and agent of Reg-Air and/or TS Air Charter, unlawfully and without the consent of Mr Harper, tampered with, removed, dismantled and substituted parts from aircraft ONC with parts from aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">(12) Mr Hobson, as director, servant and agent of Reg-Air and/or TS Air Charter, unlawfully and without the consent of Mr Harper, removed about 500 litres of fuel from aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">(13) The respondents are thus liable to Mr Harper for damages by reason of the torts of trespass to and conversion of parts of aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">(14) Further, by reason of this conduct, the respondents ensured aircraft TSO remained serviceable and capable of earning income by the supply of charter services, whilst placing aircraft ONC in a condition so that it was not airworthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The respondents thereby deprived Mr Harper of the capacity to use aircraft ONC to maintain his pilot's licence and otherwise for pleasure and enjoyment, as well as to earn income from supplying aircraft ONC for charter services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The respondents should thus be found liable to pay exemplary damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Respondents' answers to claims
 The respondents deny all of Mr Harper's principal allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The respondents answer those claims generally as follows: 
(1) Mr Hobson is, and has for 20 years been, a LAME.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Hobson never made the express representations to Mr Harper (other than to the extent that he was, and could have said, he was an aircraft engineer).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Hobson and Mr Harper had different conversations from those claimed by Mr Harper including conversations in which Mr Hobson spoke about the provision of services for the repair, maintenance and servicing of aircraft ONC in his capacity as employee and chief engineer of AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Those discussions did not include a time frame for making aircraft ONC airworthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Further, as an employee of AirAg, Mr Hobson recommended more extensive works than those required for the issue of a 100 hourly maintenance release (to the effect that aircraft ONC was airworthy) in order to make aircraft ONC suitable for charter work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">(2) There was no agreement between Mr Harper and Reg-Air as Mr Harper claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Rather, Mr Harper failed to provide AirAg with the required written authority to carry out the work necessary either for aircraft ONC to obtain a 100 hourly maintenance release or to make the aircraft suitable for charter purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Apart from that, Reg-Air sourced certain aircraft parts for Mr Harper on or about 27 September 2005 and provided tools and manuals allowing Mr Harper to install those parts on aircraft ONC, but no more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">(3) Mr Hobson did remove certain parts from aircraft ONC but did so with Mr Harper's knowledge and consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Mr Hobson re-installed some parts but others were not re-installed at Mr Harper's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">(4) Mr Hobson did not take 500 litres (or thereabouts) of fuel from aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">On occasions he drained a small amount of fuel from the aircraft to clean his tools (which Mr Harper also used on aircraft ONC), to clean his hands, and to run the towing vehicle used to tow aircraft (including aircraft ONC) around the hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">(5) Mr Harper, for his own reasons, effectively dismantled aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In so doing he used Mr Hobson's tools and manuals and sought Mr Hobson's advice as, at the same time, Mr Hobson was working on aircraft TSO in the same hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Harper's dismantling of aircraft ONC meant that significant time and expense had to be incurred in obtaining a fresh maintenance release for aircraft ONC to certify it as airworthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">DISCUSSION 
 A preliminary observation
 A preliminary observation is appropriate given the nature of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Harper's principal claims are based on disputed conversations which occurred more than three years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">His claims involve serious allegations against Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In this context certain observations of McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">His Honour said (at 318 --- 319): 
 Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive (which I will compendiously described as "misleading") within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act ), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was; and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">All this is a matter of ordinary human experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

 
 Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the court, which means that the court "must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Such satisfaction is "not ...attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved" including the "seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding": Helton v Allen [1940] HCA 20 ; (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 712.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 Helton v Allen involved application of the principles established in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 , particularly at 362 where Dixon J said that while there is only one standard of proof in civil proceedings (proof on the balance of probabilities) "(t)he seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding, are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Some undisputed facts
 Some basic facts were not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">On or about 24 February 2005 Mr Harper purchased aircraft ONC at an auction in Brisbane for $230,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Aircraft ONC, a Piper Navajo Chieftain, is a twin engine aircraft with a capacity to seat nine passengers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Mr Harper intended to make aircraft ONC suitable for use for the purposes of charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Aircraft ONC had a maintenance release that expired on 26 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Maintenance releases are regulated by Div 9 of Pt 4A of the Civil Aviation Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Insofar as relevant to the present proceeding, an aircraft may not be flown without (amongst other things) a current maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Generally, maintenance to an aircraft may only be carried out by a person who holds an aircraft maintenance engineer licence covering the maintenance and if the person either holds a certificate of approval covering the maintenance or is employed by, or working under an arrangement with, a person who holds a certificate of approval covering the maintenance or under the supervision of such a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">To sign a maintenance release such a person must also either hold a certificate of approval covering the maintenance or be employed by, or working under an arrangement with, a person who holds a certificate of approval authorising the maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On or about 10 March 2005, Mr Harper (with another pilot) flew aircraft ONC to Bankstown airport and placed it in a hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">By April 2005 Mr Harper was looking for a new hangar in which to store aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Mr Hobson was an aircraft engineer (to be precise, a LAME).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Mr Hobson was employed by AirAg as its chief engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Hobson was working on restoring his own Piper Navajo Chieftain (aircraft TSO) in a hangar at Bankstown airport, known as hangar 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">AirAg holds a certificate of approval authorising it to issue maintenance releases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Reg-Air, TS Air Charter and Mr Hobson do not hold a certificate of approval authorising the issue of maintenance releases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Reg-Air had once held such a certificate but it was cancelled in mid 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In April 2005 Mr Harper and Mr Hobson spoke to each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In or about May or June 2005, Mr Harper removed aircraft ONC from its old hangar and placed it in hangar 273 where aircraft TSO was also located and being restored by Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Aircraft TSO became airworthy in March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">On or about 17 October 2006 Mr Harper requested Bankstown Aircraft Maintenance Pty Ltd to carry out certain work to aircraft ONC, which it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Aircraft ONC was removed from hangar 273 for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">On or about 19 February 2007 Harbour City Aviation Pty Ltd also carried out work to aircraft ONC involving checking and refitting the avionics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">By mid 2007 Bankstown Aircraft Maintenance's work on aircraft ONC remained incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Repairs and maintenance to aircraft ONC ceased for a month or two in late 2007 when Mr Harper contacted the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In or about December 2007, when Mr Harper took aircraft ONC back to Bankstown Aircraft Maintenance its engineer had resigned and it could not continue to work on the aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Later in December 2007, Mr Harper took aircraft ONC to Australian Aerial Surveys Pty Ltd, also located at Bankstown airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Australian Aerial Surveys was working on another plane and did not start working on aircraft ONC until August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Harper entered into an arrangement with Australian Aerial Surveys under which the cost of repairs and maintenance to aircraft ONC would be paid for by Mr Harper making aircraft ONC available to Australian Aerial Surveys for charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Mr John Skidmore, a LAME employed by Australian Aerial Surveys, signed a maintenance release for aircraft ONC on 27 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">I deal with other facts in the context of Mr Harper's specific claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The express representations
 As noted, Mr Harper's claims are that: - (i) in April 2005 Mr Hobson, as agent for Reg-Air, represented to Mr Harper that Mr Hobson was "an authorised aircraft engineer" and it would take Reg-Air or Mr Hobson "four months to get [Mr Harper's] aircraft [ONC] into the air", (ii) in reliance on the express representations Mr Harper agreed to retain Reg-Air to provide services for repair, maintenance and servicing of aircraft ONC, and (iii) in breach of the express representations Reg-Air failed to get aircraft ONC into the air within four months or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Harper's claims about the express representations are based on conversations with Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In his first affidavit sworn 21 May 2008 Mr Harper said that in about April 2005 he had a conversation with Mr Hobson in which Mr Hobson said: 
 You can put your aircraft in Mr Criddle's hangar where I am also restoring my aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">I am AirAg Aviation Service's Chief Engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I will be happy to help you with your Aircraft when I get mine flying which will only take three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It won't take long to do yours, all it needs is a fresh 100 hourly and the fuel units fitted, about one month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">

 In his second affidavit sworn 8 September 2008 in reply to Mr Hobson's affidavit Mr Harper referred to another conversation with Mr Hobson in which Mr Hobson said: 
 Don't get AirAg to do it, it will cost you too much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I can do it and sign it off and all you will have to pay AirAg is a commission to use their licence, probably about $400 to $500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">

 The High Court (in Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited (2004) 218 CLR 592 ; [2004] HCA 60 at [37] ) has said in the context of dealing with a claim of misleading or deceptive conduct involving a representation by a real estate agent to individual purchasers: "it is necessary to consider the character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers, bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them, or which each may be taken to have known".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Further, that the agent's conduct must be considered as a whole (at [39]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The same approach must be applied in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In the present case the conduct in question is the statements of Mr Hobson said to convey the express representations (being those two statements quoted above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">I turn now to the circumstances surrounding those statements (for this purpose, assuming they were made as Mr Harper recollected).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I am satisfied from the evidence about the following matters of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In early 2005, Mr Harper had known Mr Hobson for about 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">At all times Mr Harper knew that Mr Hobson was AirAg's chief engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He also knew that neither Mr Hobson nor Reg-Air held a certificate of approval authorising the issue of maintenance releases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He knew that AirAg did hold such a certificate of approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">He knew that Mr Hobson was working on aircraft TSO (which Mr Harper correctly viewed as, in effect, Mr Hobson's aircraft) and that aircraft TSO, like aircraft ONC, was a Piper Navajo Chieftain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He knew that Mr Hobson was restoring aircraft TSO to make it suitable for charter work and had available tools and manuals for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He knew that, with modifications, aircraft ONC could be suitable for charter work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Mr Harper held a pilot's licence but was not an aircraft engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Mr Harper did not have much experience in flying a Piper Navajo Chieftain and next to no experience in maintaining or running such an aircraft for charter purposes or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In about March 2005, before the disputed statements alleged to have been made by Mr Hobson and immediately after aircraft ONC arrived at Bankstown, Mr Harper arranged for AirAg to carry out certain work to aircraft ONC involving the fuel units and temperature probes, as well as the replacement of the nose wheel bearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">At this time Mr Harper delivered aircraft ONC's log books to Mr Tony Pitt of AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">These log books remained at AirAg until at least November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Mr Harper was unhappy with the hangar in which aircraft ONC was first located at Bankstown airport because he thought they were moving his aircraft around too much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">He wanted to store his aircraft elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In early April 2005 Mr Harper discussed with Mr Pitt the possibility of AirAg taking aircraft ONC into AirAg's hangar and carrying out a 100 hourly maintenance service for aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Mr Harper thought AirAg's hangar was full and that they were too busy to work on aircraft ONC at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Before AirAg started this work, Mr Harper had discussions with Mr Hobson in which, according to Mr Harper, Mr Hobson made the statement referred to in Mr Harper's first affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Harper did not say that the conversation referred to in the second affidavit occurred at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">From Mr Harper's second affidavit, I infer that this conversation occurred some time after aircraft ONC moved into hangar 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Also in or in about April 2005, Mr Harper and Mr Hobson had discussions about what might be required to make aircraft ONC suitable for charter work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Mr Hobson told Mr Harper that to make good money from chartering the aircraft, it had to look good and that Mr Harper should install certain new equipment, put new side windows in, put in new interior plastics, and repaint the plane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Aircraft ONC did not "look good" at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The side windows were difficult to see through, the paint was old and unattractive and the aircraft's navigational and piloting systems were old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Harper wanted to charter aircraft ONC (indeed, he had bought the aircraft for that purpose) and had obtained a quote for an avionics upgrade also in or around April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In these circumstances, do the statements of Mr Hobson (assuming, for the purposes of this discussion, that they were made) convey the express representations as pleaded?</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Take the statement in the first affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The representation (as relevant, given that Mr Hobson is in fact an authorised aircraft engineer) is said to be that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC flying within four months (the representation having been made in April 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">According to the statement in which the representation was made, Reg-Air would do so in circumstances where, for the next three months, Mr Hobson would be working on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In other words, according to the statement attributed to Mr Hobson, it would only take one month's work to get aircraft ONC "in the air".</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Harper's affidavits identified Mr Hobson's statements and nothing else (such as Mr Harper's response or any other part of the conversation or its context).</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The context, however, is important and may be inferred from the evidence as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The statement attributed to Mr Hobson in Mr Harper's first affidavit was made in a conversation between two people who had known each other for 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Each (effectively) owned the same or similar aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Each aircraft required work to be suitable for charter purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Mr Hobson, a LAME for some 20 years, had been working on his aircraft for a considerable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Mr Harper, a pilot, had just purchased his aircraft, wanted it to be suitable for charter purposes, but had little, if any, experience in flying (let alone chartering) such an aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Mr Hobson was aware of available space in the hangar where his aircraft was located and advised Mr Harper to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In so doing Mr Hobson also said that he was AirAg's chief engineer (which was true and, in any event, which Mr Harper already knew), and that he would be "happy to help" Mr Harper with aircraft ONC once he had got "mine flying".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The surrounding circumstances and language used in the statement attributed to Mr Hobson strongly suggest, at best, an informal arrangement where one aircraft owner (with relevant qualifications, experience, tools and manuals) expressed a willingness to assist another (without relevant qualifications or experience).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The references in the statement that it would only take three months to get aircraft TSO flying and that it would not take long to do aircraft ONC "as all it needs is a fresh 100 hourly and the fuel units fitted, about one month" do not alter the context of the conversation from that described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Mr Hobson, as Mr Harper knew, was working on aircraft TSO in his own time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Mr Hobson's statement is to the effect that he wanted to complete the restoration of aircraft TSO before helping Mr Harper with aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Mr Hobson's estimate of three months to complete the work on aircraft TSO was simply an estimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Given that Mr Harper knew Mr Hobson was working in his spare time, Mr Harper must also have appreciated that the progress of work would depend on how much spare time Mr Hobson had available and what problems he encountered in carrying out work on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Similarly, the reference to one month being required for the completion of the fresh 100 hourly maintenance release and to have the fuel units re-fitted was also an estimate made in the context described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Mr Harper must have known that, when making the estimate, Mr Hobson had not inspected aircraft ONC and thus assumed that only minor work was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">As noted, the context and language of Mr Hobson's statement indicate nothing more than one aircraft owner holding relevant qualifications and experience being willing to give assistance to another unqualified and inexperienced aircraft owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Nothing in the context or substance of the statements suggests that Mr Hobson was speaking at that time as the agent of Reg-Air.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The conversation, in context, is incapable of conveying a representation that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Different difficulties confront the conversation to which Mr Harper referred in his second affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Mr Harper made no mention of this statement as in any way relevant to his decision to move aircraft ONC into hangar 273 in his first affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In his second affidavit Mr Harper was replying to Mr Hobson's evidence that, over the two to three months following Mr Harper moving aircraft ONC into hangar 273, Mr Hobson asked Mr Harper for a signed purchase or work order to be provided to AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Mr Harper denied that Mr Hobson had done so and said that, instead, Mr Hobson had made the statement referred to in Mr Harper's second affidavit (quoted at [27] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The context indicates that the second statement (if made) must have been made some months after Mr Harper moved aircraft ONC into hangar 273 (that is, two to three months after May or June 2005) and thus after the alleged express representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The statement in the second affidavit is ambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The "work" to which Mr Hobson was referring in his affidavit was a complete repaint and interior refurbishment of aircraft ONC including replacement of all 14 windows, complete replacement of instrument panel wiring, avionics and navigation instruments and, thereafter, the issue of a maintenance release at a cost of $150,000 to $200,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The work to which Mr Harper was referring in his second affidavit could not be this work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Yet Mr Harper definitely wanted to have work done that was unnecessary for the issue of a 100 hourly maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Mr Harper wanted the internal plastics and windows replaced as Mr Hobson recommended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In fact, Mr Hobson obtained the parts necessary for some of this work and billed Mr Harper for them and labour costs as Reg-Air on 27 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">These events are inconsistent with Mr Harper having understood Mr Hobson to have represented that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Further, in his oral evidence, Mr Harper gave a different (or, at least, additional) version of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Mr Harper said that after aircraft ONC had been in hangar 273 for about a month Mr Hobson suggested "that we might as well do a fresh 100 hourly and put it back into service with a clean 100 hourly that would allow him to check the plane out properly, make sure it was all okay".</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Mr Harper said (I infer in relation to the same work) that Mr Hobson "undertook a gentleman's agreement with me to carry out this work".</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">If this statement is part of the context of the statement attributed to Mr Hobson in the second affidavit (and I infer it must be), then it supports my inference that Mr Harper knew that, at the time of the statement referred to in the first affidavit, Mr Hobson had not inspected aircraft ONC and thus was not aware of its condition other than from a cursory external look.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In these circumstances none of the statements are capable of conveying a representation that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Other factors are also inconsistent with Mr Harper having understood the express representations to have been made by Mr Hobson as agent for Reg-Air.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Mr Harper knew that for aircraft ONC to fly after 26 August 2005 it needed a fresh maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">He knew that Reg-Air and Mr Hobson did not hold certificates of approval authorising either to issue maintenance releases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Mr Harper knew that Mr Hobson was AirAg's chief engineer and that any maintenance release would be an AirAg document issued under AirAg's certificate of approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Reg-Air is not mentioned in either (indeed, any) of the statements which Mr Harper attributed to Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">For these reasons I am not satisfied that the express representations, as pleaded, were conveyed by either of the statements which Mr Harper attributed to Mr Hobson (other than the true statement that Mr Hobson is an authorised aircraft engineer).</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Accordingly, I do not need to consider s 51A of the Trade Practices Act (representations as to future matters) which, in any event, neither party mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Even if I am incorrect in this conclusion, I am not satisfied that Mr Harper relied on a representation that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The statement in which this representation is said to have been conveyed included Mr Hobson working for three months on aircraft TSO and then one month thereafter on aircraft ONC, with the relevant work being that necessary for the issue of the 100 hourly maintenance release and the re-installation of the fuel units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">However, Mr Harper himself, in about May to July 2005 and thus relatively soon after aircraft ONC was moved into hangar 273, undertook a course of action inconsistent with this objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Even if, as Mr Harper's case proposed, he took apart the dashboard of aircraft ONC under Mr Hobson's supervision as part of the alleged agreement with Reg-Air, Mr Harper also undertook other substantial work that had nothing to do with obtaining a 100 hourly maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Mr Harper, in cross-examination, agreed that he had removed all of the aircraft's control surfaces (ailerons, flaps, rudder on the tail fin, and re-stabiliser elevator).</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Harper did this work with Mr Hobson's assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Harper did about two thirds of this work and Mr Hobson about one third.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Some control surfaces need two people to handle them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Mr Harper did this work in anticipation of having aircraft ONC repainted in accordance with Mr Hobson's suggestion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Mr Harper also removed the pilot's and co-pilot's seats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He removed the passenger seats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In doing so, Mr Harper had to remove the internal plastic trim of the aircraft's cabin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Mr Harper agreed that he always intended to replace the internal plastics and the windows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The work Mr Harper did meant aircraft ONC appeared to have been "gutted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Mr Harper obtained quotes for repainting and an avionics upgrade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Mr Harper also purchased a particular fuel control management unit for the purpose of installing in aircraft ONC because Mr Hobson had one in his aircraft and recommended it to Mr Harper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Throughout all of this work, Mr Harper used Mr Hobson as a source of advice and used Mr Hobson's (as well as his own) tools.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Further, in May 2006, Mr Harper sought refinance for the purpose of refurbishing the interior and exterior of aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">These facts are inconsistent with Mr Harper having relied on a representation to the effect that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">In about June or July 2005 another relevant event occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">With Mr Harper's permission, AirAg borrowed the nose gear doors from aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">AirAg did so for the purpose of modelling some nose gear doors for another aircraft where doors could not be found to fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Allowing these parts to be borrowed is consistent with Mr Harper not being particularly concerned whether aircraft ONC was airworthy or not at that time or, indeed, for the whole period during which the nose gear doors were off the aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">As it turned out, these doors were not re-installed until January 2007 (an earlier attempt in October 2006 disclosed that the wrong door had been returned).</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">These circumstances too are inconsistent with Mr Harper having relied on the express representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I consider these facts, particularly the work Mr Harper carried out and intended to carry out to aircraft ONC, inconsistent with Mr Harper having relied on a representation that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">As noted, the statement on which Mr Harper relied is one in which Mr Hobson said he would continue to work on his own aircraft TSO for three months and spend the next month on aircraft ONC re-installing the fuel control units that Mr Harper had removed and carrying out such work as necessary for the issue of a 100 hourly maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Yet within a month or so of arriving in hangar 273, Mr Harper commenced works which had the effect of practically gutting aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">I consider that the work Mr Harper did made it impossible for aircraft ONC to obtain a maintenance release within four months of April 2005 or by a mere month's work (which was all that Mr Hobson, on Mr Harper's version of the conversation, anticipated).</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">As such, Mr Harper could not have relied on the express representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The actions Mr Harper took effectively ensured that the express representations, if they were made, could not be fulfilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It is not strictly necessary for me to make any finding about the reasons Mr Harper undertook the course of action he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Nevertheless, it is apparent that Mr Harper's actions are irreconcilable with him having relied on the express representations (if they were made) and consistent with Mr Hobson's version of what happened between him and Mr Harper between about April and September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Counsel for Mr Harper submitted that nothing Mr Hobson said should be accepted without independent corroboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">I deal with this submission about Mr Hobson's credit below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">I have concluded that the submission should not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Apart from one matter (concerning the cancellation of Reg-Air's certificate of approval in 2001), Mr Hobson was a frank, albeit taciturn, witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Mr Hobson frequently referred to the length of time which had passed since his conversations with Mr Harper and the likely adverse effect of this on his memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Mr Hobson was comfortable with the shortcomings in his own memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">He was willing to accept that he had said something like he was AirAg's chief engineer and would be happy to help Mr Harper after he had finished with his own aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">He was open about the restrictive attitude he took towards discovery of documents and his answers to interrogatories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">According to Mr Hobson, he told Mr Harper that if Mr Harper wanted to charter aircraft ONC extensive works were required (that is, a complete repaint and interior refurbishment, replacement of all 14 windows, complete replacement of instrument panel wiring, avionics and navigation instruments and, thereafter, the issue of a maintenance release) and that the cost of this work would be $150,000 to $200,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The work Mr Harper carried out from about May 2005 onwards which had the effect of gutting aircraft ONC is consistent with Mr Harper, at least at that time (even if he subsequently changed his mind), starting the process of these extensive works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">So too are the quotes Mr Harper obtained and the reason he gave for refinancing the aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Contrary to the submissions on behalf of Mr Harper, I do not find the fact that Reg-Air issued an invoice on 27 September 2005 supportive of Mr Harper's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The invoice appears to relate to items which Mr Hobson agreed that he had recommended as part of the more extensive works to make aircraft ONC suitable for charter work and which Mr Harper denied wanting to carry out at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Yet, as discussed, Mr Harper took many steps consistent with the intention of carrying out these more extensive works and inconsistent with any belief that Reg-Air would have aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">As to the balance of the submissions said to support this aspect of Mr Harper's case: 
(1) Although Mr Harper thought AirAg was too busy to do the work, Mr Pitt said AirAg was not particularly busy at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Mr Pitt was an impressive witness with no direct interest in the outcome of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">While Mr Harper may have had this understanding at some time, I prefer Mr Pitt's evidence about this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">(2) Mr Harper did not retrieve aircraft ONC's log books from AirAg until November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">If, as was submitted, he did so because Mr Hobson was going to do the work and not AirAg, then the period of four months said to have been conveyed as part of the express representations had already passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">On the basis of the express representations (if made), the work should have been completed by the end of August or perhaps September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Yet during that period Mr Harper was dismantling aircraft ONC and had left his logbooks with AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">(3) Mr Hobson's estimate of a cost of $10,000 to $15,000 for aircraft ONC to obtain a 100 hourly maintenance release (which he accepted he might have given before any inspection) clearly did not extend to any of the works Mr Harper carried out in dismantling aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">This must be so given that Mr Harper attributed to Mr Hobson, as part of the statement said to convey the express representations, a description of the required work as being limited to "a fresh 100 hourly and the fuel units fitted", taking only about one month to complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">(4) Mr Hobson's acceptance that he may well have had conversations with Mr Harper about when he might be able to help Mr Harper with aircraft ONC is consistent with Mr Hobson's version of these events in 2005, particularly given the work Mr Harper had carried out to aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">(5) The fact that Mr Harper re-installed the fuel control units under Mr Hobson's supervision is also consistent with the fact that Mr Hobson gave substantial advice and assistance to Mr Harper without charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The lack of any invoice from Reg-Air or Mr Hobson to Mr Harper (other than the single invoice of 27 September 2005 referred to above) supports my findings about the character of the statements attributed to Mr Hobson when considered with regard to the overall context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">(6) Mr Hobson did not agree that the windows had to be done to obtain a 100 hourly maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">However, he said that the work, if it were to be done, had to be done under a certificate of approval or as part of the 100 hourly maintenance release (which is different).</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In other words, I do not accept that this work was necessary for a maintenance release to be issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Rather, this work appears to have been part of the more extensive works to aircraft ONC which I consider Mr Harper intended to undertake in 2005 (even if, as it seems, he subsequently changed his mind).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">(7) Mr Hobson's capacity to do private work (that is, on his own time and not in his capacity as an AirAg employee) requires consideration of all of the evidence relevant to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In closing submissions, counsel for Mr Harper relied on one part of that evidence (Mr Hobson agreeing it was possible that he could do side work and use AirAg's certificate of approval if required).</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">However, Mr Hobson, in another part of his evidence, was adamant that if a maintenance release was required he only worked for AirAg and such releases were only issued by AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Mr Pitt gave evidence about the practice of work on the side or private work consistent with that of Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">I am satisfied that the evidence should be understood as follows: - (i) Mr Hobson could carry out private work provided that it did not involve the issue of a maintenance release, and (ii) if any work required the issue of a maintenance release, Mr Hobson only carried out that work as chief engineer of AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">These facts are also consistent with Mr Harper, at least in or around April to near the end of 2005 or some time thereafter, wanting to make aircraft ONC more attractive for charter by carrying out far more extensive work than that contemplated by the express representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">For these reasons I do not accept that Mr Harper relied on the express representations if they were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Further, and if it be necessary so to find, I prefer Mr Hobson's version of his dealings with Mr Harper about work on aircraft ONC, at least in the period from April 2005 to the end of that year (that is, a period including that to which the express representations relate).</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Consistent with the findings above, Mr Hobson's version of these events better reflects the objective circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Mr Hobson's concessions about the frailty of his memory (particularly about disputed conversations years after the events in question) also support, rather than undermine, his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The fact that Mr Hobson was not forthright about one matter (the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of Reg-Air's certificate of approval in 2001), does not undermine the credibility of the balance of his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Mr Hobson's approach to the cancellation of the certificate (that he had surrendered the certificate by reason of his withdrawal of the appeal against cancellation) is plausible from a layperson's perspective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">In any event, this matter is also peripheral to the substantive issues in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Mr Harper's evidence about the express representations, in contrast to that of Mr Hobson, was difficult to reconcile with the objective circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Although Mr Harper said he had a clear memory of certain statements, his evidence provides little or no information about the context in which they were alleged to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">For example, in his first affidavit Mr Harper referred to a conversation in September 2006 in which he allegedly said to Mr Hobson words to the effect "I'm fed up with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">My plane has been gutted and you still haven't put the magneto on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In fact (as emerged during cross-examination), Mr Harper had himself substantially dismantled aircraft ONC by August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Despite Mr Harper's apparently firm recollections, allowance must be made for the ordinary human process by which statements in a longer conversation are somewhat artificially reconstructed, particularly where (as in this case): - (i) the participants in the conversation have subsequently fallen out to the extent that litigation has ensued, (ii) the statements said to convey the representations have been reconstructed in an affidavit largely in isolation from the surrounding context including the balance of the conversation, (iii) more than three years have passed since the statements were said to have been made, and (iv) the evidence of both Mr Harper and Mr Hobson supports an inference that (unsurprisingly given that their aircraft were in the same hangar) they had numerous conversations only some of which have been elicited through this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Having regard to these matters significant weight must be given to the evidence of the objective circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Those circumstances are not readily reconcilable with Mr Harper's version of the course of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">This conclusion does not involve any inference adverse to Mr Harper's credit but recognises the force of observations to the effect of those made in Watson v Foxman (quoted at [9] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Accordingly, Mr Harper's claims based on the express representations cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The implied representation
 The implied representation alleged by Mr Harper depends on Reg-Air and Mr Harper having agreed that it would take Reg-Air four months to have aircraft ONC in the air.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Mr Harper contended that that this agreement included an implied term that the services Reg-Air provided to aircraft ONC would comply with all requirements of the Civil Aviation Act and Civil Aviation Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Further, that Reg-Air breached the implied representation carried by this implied term by not complying with these legislative requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">For the reasons given above, I do not accept that there was any agreement between Reg-Air and Mr Harper to the effect claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Accordingly, there cannot be an implied term of the agreement, functioning as an implied representation, as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">While this conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this aspect of Mr Harper's claims there is another difficulty which these claims confront.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Specifically, Mr Harper has not established that Mr Hobson, in his capacity as director of Reg-Air, undertook any work on aircraft ONC that did not comply with the Civil Aviation Act or Civil Aviation Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">It is true that Reg-Air invoiced Mr Harper on one occasion (27 September 2005) for the procurement of parts and labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Mr Hobson explained that the labour charge on this invoice in fact related to Mr Harper using Mr Hobson's tools and manuals to carry out the work, albeit under Mr Hobson's supervision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">As neither Mr Hobson nor Reg-Air held a certificate of approval authorising them to issue a maintenance release, I infer that Mr Hobson's supervision of Mr Harper's work in this regard must have been in Mr Hobson's capacity as the chief engineer of AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Even if this inference is not drawn, Mr Harper's allegations about breaches of legislative requirements did not relate to this work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">In fact, there are no invoices from Reg-Air (or Mr Hobson or TS Air Charter) in connection with the work Mr Harper alleged that Mr Hobson, as agent for Reg-Air, carried out to aircraft ONC in breach of the legislative requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Mr Harper identified ten components of work to which the allegations of breach of the implied representation related: - (i) removal of the turbo charger air intakes for both engines, (ii) removal of the left hand engine magneto, (iii) dismantling components associated with the auto pilot, (iv) dismantling the switch dial dashboard component, (v) dismantling the centre console components, (vi) dismantling the left hand steering column multi-function switch, (vii) removing inspections ports and panels from the wings and fuselage, (viii) removing and substituting the electric elevator servo trim motor and substituting a defective the electric elevator servo trim motor, (ix) removing about 500 litres of fuel, and (x) removing the stall warning delay timer and cutting its wires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Mr Hobson admitted that he personally removed or used the turbo charger air intakes for both engines, the left hand engine magneto, the electric elevator servo trim motor and the battery (the latter not being the subject of complaint but relevant as part of the context).</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Mr Hobson admitted that he had supervised works by Mr Harper to the fuel control unit and the electric fuel boost pumps (neither of which are the subject of complaint) and by Mr Dean Mackey of Harbour City Aviation to the electric trim (or multi purpose) switch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Mr Hobson also noted that Mr Pitt of AirAg had borrowed the nose gear doors from aircraft ONC with Mr Harper's permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He otherwise denied the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The works identified in Mr Hobson's admissions provide an important part of the context for the determination of these claims (particularly when it is remembered that the claim is breach of an implied representation by Reg-Air arising from an agreement between Reg-Air and Mr Harper pursuant to which Reg-Air, through Mr Hobson, would provide services of maintenance and repair to aircraft ONC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">I consider the evidence about those works below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">
(1) The nose gear doors : In November 2005 (after Mr Harper had carried out much of his work of dismantling aircraft ONC), AirAg removed the nose gear doors for the purpose of using them as a model for another aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Mr Harper permitted these parts to be borrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">They were ultimately returned in January or February 2007 after an earlier attempt in October 2006 disclosed that one of the doors was not the original part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Mr Harper appears not to have demanded any earlier return of these parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The evidence does not support any inference that Reg-Air was involved in these works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">(2) The fuel control units : Cross-examination of Mr Harper disclosed that Mr Harper removed the fuel control pumps from aircraft ONC under the supervision of Mr Pitt of AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Mr Harper also re-installed the pumps under Mr Hobson's supervision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Mr Hobson was qualified to perform this supervision function (which Mr Harper accepted in cross-examination).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">In context, I infer that Mr Hobson performed this function either as AirAg's chief engineer or in his personal capacity (as a friendly acquaintance of Mr Harper's of some 10 years' standing and who, according to Mr Harper, wished to see aircraft ONC in good condition and readily provided assistance to Mr Harper as and when required).</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The evidence does not support any inference that Reg-Air was involved in these works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">(3) The battery : Mr Hobson used the battery from aircraft ONC and installed it on another aircraft (not aircraft TSO) that was due out on a charter flight and had a battery failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The battery was out of aircraft ONC on a charger and the other aircraft had passengers on board ready for flight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Mr Hobson said he called Mr Harper for permission to use this battery and return it to the charger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Mr Harper said he was not aware of the use of his battery but had no concern about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I prefer Mr Hobson's evidence about this as he (rather than Mr Harper) had some reason to recall this event (Mr Hobson being at the airport while the other aircraft was ready to take off when its battery failed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The evidence does not support any inference that Reg-Air was involved in this event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">(4) Turbo charger air intakes : Mr Hobson removed the turbo charger air intakes from aircraft ONC and installed them on aircraft TSO in or about February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">At that time the turbo charger air intakes from aircraft TSO were being "re-bushed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Mr Hobson returned the parts on 3 April 2006 but Mr Harper refused to allow him to re-install them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">In other words, Mr Hobson took the parts for the purpose of temporary use on aircraft TSO (which had become airworthy in March 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">TS Air Charter owns aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The evidence does not support the inference that Reg-Air had anything to do with the taking of these parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Moreover, the implied representation is said to arise from an agreement between Reg-Air and Mr Harper for the provision of services by Reg-Air to aircraft ONC (that is, to get aircraft ONC in the air within four months of April 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">The taking of these parts did not have anything to do with the provision of services to aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">They were taken to assist aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Whether they were taken with or without permission is a separate issue (dealt with under the common law claims below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">But as these facts disclose, the taking of these parts had nothing to do with Reg-Air providing services to aircraft ONC as claimed by Mr Harper and thus could not be subject to the implied representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">(5) Left hand engine magneto : Mr Hobson removed the left hand engine magneto from aircraft ONC on 14 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The magneto was taken to Albury where aircraft TSO had developed a problem apparently with the intention of using the magneto to get aircraft TSO back to Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">However, aircraft ONC's magneto was damaged in transit and could not be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Mr Hobson later arranged to have this magneto repaired and "zero timed" so that it had a full service life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">He returned the part to Mr Harper in October 2006 with a release note for the repair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Again, whether or not Mr Hobson had permission to borrow the part is a separate issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">On the same basis as the turbo charger air intakes discussed above, these facts disclose that the taking of this part had nothing to do with Reg-Air providing services to aircraft ONC as claimed by Mr Harper and thus could not be subject to the implied representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">(6) Electric elevator servo trim motor : Mr Hobson removed this part from aircraft ONC in about June 2006 intending to install the part into aircraft TSO for the purpose of flying aircraft TSO to Adelaide for the auto-pilot components to be checked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">After repairs to the components of the auto-pilot were complete and when aircraft TSO returned to Bankstown, Mr Hobson took the trim servo motor then on aircraft TSO and installed it on aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Leaving aside the many disputes concerning the trim servo motor (discussed below in respect of the common law claims), the relevant fact for present purposes is that nothing Mr Hobson did was for the purpose of servicing aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The work was done to assist aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">On the same basis as discussed above, these facts disclose that the taking of this part had nothing to do with Reg-Air providing services to aircraft ONC as claimed by Mr Harper and thus could not be subject to the implied representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">(7) Multi-purpose switch : Mr Hobson engaged Mr Mackey of Harbour City Aviation to carry out work on aircraft TSO in February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Mr Mackey said that during that work he noticed that there was a broken tab on a little micro switch on the column of aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">According to Mr Mackey, Mr Hobson told him to remove the tab from the switch on aircraft ONC and install it on aircraft TSO to replace the broken one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Those switches are readily available and cost about $7 or $8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Aircraft ONC was not airworthy at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Mr Mackey said he was not, at that time, carrying out any work on aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Mr Hobson said that they needed to check the wiring configuration on aircraft ONC to ensure that the work on aircraft TSO had been done correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">When Mr Mackey inspected the wiring on aircraft ONC, he told Mr Hobson that it had perished and was a fire risk and would need to be replaced before the aircraft could be flown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Mr Hobson instructed Mr Mackey to leave the wiring exposed so that the wiring problem would be obvious to the person next carrying out maintenance on aircraft ONC (which he described as a requirement of his obligations as a LAME).</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Irrespective of the inconsistencies in this evidence one thing is clear --- Mr Hobson and Mr Mackey were working on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">If Mr Hobson caused a tab on a switch to be taken from aircraft ONC, he did so to assist aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">On the same basis as discussed above, these facts disclose that the taking of this part had nothing to do with Reg-Air providing services to aircraft ONC as claimed by Mr Harper and thus could not be subject to the implied representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">(8) Other works : Mr Hobson denied involvement in the other matters identified by Mr Harper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">As to the aircraft parts, insofar as Mr Hobson agreed that panels had to be removed to access the trim servo, I infer that he must have removed those panels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Otherwise I do not accept that other panels had to be removed to access the trim servo motor as Mr Harper alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Consistent with the findings above, these works were not done by Reg-Air for the purpose of servicing aircraft ONC but by Mr Hobson for the purpose of assisting aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Accordingly, these works had nothing to do with Reg-Air providing services to aircraft ONC as claimed by Mr Harper and thus could not be subject to the implied representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">(9) The fuel issue : Mr Hobson admitted draining small amounts of fuel (into a tin container) from aircraft ONC for the purpose of cleaning tools and running the towing equipment which moves aircraft (including aircraft ONC) around the hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">This evidence was consistent with the observations of Jeffrey Criddle (general manager of Australian Aerial Surveys Pty Ltd and who gave evidence in the proceeding).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Mr Hobson denied taking about 500 litres of fuel from aircraft ONC to use in aircraft TSO or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">There are two difficulties with Mr Harper's claims about the missing fuel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">First, insofar as Mr Harper's case is based on the implied representation (with which I am presently dealing), the taking of fuel to use in aircraft TSO as alleged has nothing to do with Reg-Air servicing aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Second, the allegation is effectively one of theft by Mr Hobson in circumstances where: - (i) Mr Harper only checked the fuel when aircraft ONC first arrived at Bankstown in March 2005 and again in October or November 2006, some 19 months later, (ii) in this period of 19 months aircraft ONC was in three different hangars, (iii) all people who had access to those hangars also had access to aircraft ONC, (iv) the people who had carried out work on aircraft ONC during that period, such as AirAg personnel, also had access to aircraft ONC, including the fuel (because the fuel tanks are not lockable), (v) Mr Harper moved the aircraft from the first hangar to hangar 273 because he was unhappy with the treatment of his aircraft in that hangar, and (vi) Mr Hobson denied the allegation other than to the (minor) extent of fuel used noted in circumstances where Mr Harper used Mr Hobson's tools on aircraft ONC without Mr Hobson demanding payment and Mr Harper benefited from the towing equipment in the hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The evidence, in these circumstances, cannot sustain a finding that Mr Hobson drained a large amount of fuel from aircraft ONC for the purpose of using it in aircraft TSO or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">As the discussion above discloses, the reasoning underlying Mr Harper's claims about the implied representation has a number of difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">In particular, on the one hand, Mr Harper alleged, in effect, that Mr Hobson cannibalised aircraft ONC for the benefit of aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On the other hand, in order to found an allegation of breach of the implied representation, Mr Harper said these works were part of the agreement for Reg-Air to service aircraft ONC and get it flying within four months of April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The two concepts are not readily reconcilable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Finally, it must also be remembered that aircraft ONC's log books remained in AirAg's office from about March until November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Mr Harper never gave the log books to Mr Hobson either personally or in his capacity as an agent of Reg-Air.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Neither Mr Hobson nor Reg-Air sent any invoice to Mr Harper for any work carried out on aircraft ONC apart from the invoice of 27 September 2005 discussed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Mr Harper carried out extensive works which effectively gutted aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">These facts are inconsistent with the agreement alleged by Mr Harper and thus also undermine his claim insofar as it was based on an agreement including an implied term founding the implied representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">For these reasons I do not accept Mr Harper's claims based on the alleged implied representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">The implied warranty
 The implied warranty claim is based on s 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">This claim thus depends on the existence of a contract for supply of services by a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">I have found above that there was no agreement between Reg-Air and Mr Harper as Mr Harper alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">No other agreement was pleaded in the second amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Accordingly, this claim must also be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">In any event, because this claim depends on the same facts as the implied representation claim, it suffers from the same difficulties which would require its rejection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In oral submissions counsel for Mr Harper proposed a different basis for liability, namely, that if (as he claimed) Mr Hobson had taken the parts with Mr Harper's permission on the basis that Mr Hobson alleged (namely, that as part of a general quid pro quo for use of tools, manuals and access to Mr Hobson's advice, Mr Harper agreed either expressly or impliedly that Mr Hobson could take parts from aircraft ONC for temporary use provided he re-installed them) then, nevertheless, there was a contract for supply by a corporation within the meaning of s 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">I do not accept this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">First, it was never pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Second, there is no basis for inferring that any such agreement involved Reg-Air as opposed to Mr Hobson either in his personal capacity or as an agent of TS Air Charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Third, it is difficult to see how Reg-Air was doing anything (let alone supplying services) in the course of a business when Mr Hobson borrowed parts from aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">For these reasons I am not satisfied that the circumstances relied upon by Mr Harper fit within s 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Statutory claims and damages
 For the reasons given above, I do not accept any of Mr Harper's claims based on the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">It follows that Mr Harper's claims for statutory damages (s 82) and breach of the implied warranty under s 74(1) cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">It also follows that the claims of accessorial liability on the part of Mr Hobson under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Common law claims
 Unlike the claims based on the Trade Practices Act , the common law claims of conversion of parts from, and trespass to, aircraft ONC, are made against each respondent (that is, Mr Hobson personally and acting as agent for Reg-Air and/or TS Air Charter).</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The torts of trespass to and conversion of goods protect against any "direct interference with possessory rights in chattels" (Fleming, John G. The Law of Torts (9 th ed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Law Book Company: Sydney (1998) p 58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Neither tort can be committed if the person with the possessory right consents to the interference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">I will deal with the claim relating to the removal of the fuel from aircraft ONC immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">As discussed above, the evidence does not establish that Mr Hobson, in any capacity, removed fuel from aircraft ONC other than small amounts for the purpose of cleaning his tools and hands as well as filling the towing device which moved aircraft around the hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In circumstances where Mr Harper used Mr Hobson's tools and had the benefit of the towing equipment in the hangar, I do not characterise such conduct as a sufficiently serious interference with Mr Harper's possessory rights to amount to the torts of trespass or conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Alternatively, I consider that the circumstances give rise to implied consent from Mr Harper to Mr Hobson to access small amounts of fuel from aircraft ONC for these limited purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Otherwise, and as noted, an unknown number of other people had access to aircraft ONC over the 19 month period between fuel readings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The aircraft was situated in three different hangars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Harper thought his aircraft was being moved around too much in the first hangar and thus removed the aircraft from that hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Mr Hobson denied the allegations other than with respect to the minor amounts of fuel used for the limited purposes of tool cleaning, filling the towing equipment and cleaning his hands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The evidence is a manifestly inadequate basis upon which to found a conclusion that Mr Hobson took some 500 (or 450 or thereabouts) litres of fuel from aircraft ONC for use in aircraft TSO or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Apart from the fuel, Mr Hobson said Mr Harper permitted certain parts to be borrowed provided they were returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">He denied any involvement with the balance of the items the subject of Mr Harper's allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Mr Hobson said that he recalled a conversation in February 2006 in which Mr Harper said Mr Hobson could borrow the turbo charger air intakes from aircraft ONC because those on aircraft TSO were being "re-bushed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">According to Mr Hobson, Mr Harper said "No problem, as long as they're returned and put back on the aircraft".</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Mr Hobson said the same process occurred in relation to the trim servo motor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Aircraft TSO had ongoing problems with the auto pilot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Mr Hobson approached Mr Harper in about June 2006 to borrow the trim servo from aircraft ONC so aircraft TSO could be "hand-flown" to Adelaide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Mr Hobson and Mr Harper had a discussion, possibly in the hangar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Mr Hobson asked to borrow the trim servo motor and Mr Harper replied in words to the effect "No problem, as long as they're returned and put back on the aircraft".</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Mr Hobson could not recall the details of the discussion about the magneto but recalled telling Mr Harper about the problem with aircraft TSO in Albury and a conversation including words to the effect of Mr Hobson saying "I require one and a half hours of flying time and need to ferry the aircraft to Bankstown" and Mr Harper responding "Yes, you can borrow that magneto, as long as it's returned and refitted to the engine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">In cross-examination Mr Hobson denied that he had assumed Mr Harper's approval to borrow parts from aircraft ONC because of Mr Harper having agreed to AirAg borrowing the nose wheel doors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Mr Hobson agreed that he had not put the details of the conversations in his affidavits because he thought he had dealt with the issue of consent by his general statement that Mr Harper had given permission for the parts to be borrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">He accepted that his memory of these conversations was not clear as he could not remember the day or month on which they occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">For example, in respect of the trim servo motor he recalled asking to borrow the part but not the details of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">He agreed that in the normal course of his business he would ask to borrow a part of he wanted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Further, he agreed that his evidence of the conversations with Mr Harper was based on his usual practice of requesting permission to borrow parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He said he recollected the conversations but not the details of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Mr Harper denied all of these conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">He said that he gave no permission to Mr Hobson to borrow parts except for the nose gear doors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">According to Mr Harper, he noticed the missing magneto and trim servo motor and various switches in September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Mr Harper also alleged conversations with Mr Hobson in which he questioned the removal of parts from his aircraft culminating in Mr Harper accusing Mr Hobson of gutting aircraft ONC on or about 25 September 2006 and instructing him not to touch aircraft ONC on or about 17 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Mr Hobson denied each of these conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">As noted, Mr Harper's counsel submitted that Mr Hobson's evidence should not be accepted unless corroborated by independent evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">This submission placed significant weight on an AirAg additional worksheet and the events surrounding the trim servo motor to support this challenge to Mr Hobson's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The AirAg additional worksheet identified works to aircraft ONC including with respect to the nose gear doors, the battery, the turbo charger air intakes, the left-hand engine magneto, and the trim servo motor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The worksheet refers to these parts being variously removed, returned and loaned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Mr Hobson said he prepared the worksheet from various notes he had made over time in respect of work he did to aircraft ONC (including yellow post-it notes stuck to his tool box).</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Mr Hobson wrote up the worksheet in one go in February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Mr Harper's case was to the effect that Mr Hobson created the worksheet much later (October 2008 at the earliest) as a defence to Mr Harper's claims, including his claims about inadequate record keeping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">I do not accept the submissions for Mr Harper that the additional worksheet was created in circumstances other than those asserted by Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">The fact that the worksheet is in the same pen is neutral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Mr Hobson said he had prepared the worksheet from notes on one occasion in February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">From the evidence of Mr Richard Best and David Morgan (independent experts), as well as that of Mr Pitt, Mr Skidmore and Mr Hobson, I infer that the preparation of worksheets may, but need not, be done at the time individual items of work are carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Rather, depending on the practice of the individual, records must be prepared at the completion of each stage of maintenance or the maintenance overall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">From the evidence, I am not satisfied that Mr Hobson had to create a worksheet for each item he borrowed from aircraft ONC at the time of borrowing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Further, it is not clear to me that Mr Hobson had any obligation to sign the document at any time before completion of a maintenance release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Given that aircraft ONC was not airworthy at any time when Mr Hobson borrowed the parts or said he created the document I am not satisfied that he acted in breach of any legislative requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Further, the fact that there is a date error in the document (a reference to "16/10/08" rather than "16/10/06") does not suggest to me that the document was written after 16 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">If Mr Hobson had intended to create a document after 16 October 2008 and falsely claim he had written it in February 2007 then I would have expected him to exercise great care in his references to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">The fact that the "16/10/08" date is inconsistent with the balance of the document tends to indicate that it is an error as Mr Hobson said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Nor do I find the circumstances of disclosure of the document surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">One of the features of this case is that AirAg is not a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Mr Hobson did not have an obligation to discover documents held only by AirAg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The allegations against Mr Hobson in relation to the worksheet are serious and, as Dixon J noted in Briginshaw , this seriousness affects the answer to any question concerning the alleged suspect nature of the worksheet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Mr Hobson denied the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The evidence relied on to cast doubt on his denials is at best equivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">I accept Mr Hobson's evidence about the worksheet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">I do not accept that it provides a basis for any general conclusion undermining Mr Hobson's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">I have reached a similar conclusion about the circumstances surrounding the trim servo motor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Mr Hobson said (and I accept) that he borrowed the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC because aircraft TSO had auto-pilot problems and he needed to take the components of the auto-pilot on aircraft TSO to Adelaide for inspection and repair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">He removed components of the auto-pilot from aircraft TSO for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">He took the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC intending to install it on aircraft TSO to allow it to be "hand-flown" to Adelaide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">However, the release note for the trim servo motor repaired in Adelaide and dated 13 June 2006 relates to the overhaul in Adelaide of trim servo motor 5096.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">This is the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">In other words, the release note shows that Mr Hobson had aircraft ONC's trim servo motor inspected and certified in Adelaide and not the trim servo motor from aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">It is also clear from Mr Skidmore's evidence that he removed trim servo motor 3262 from aircraft ONC in November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Records show that this trim servo motor belongs to aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Mr Harper's case was to the effect that Mr Hobson took the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC and deliberately substituted it with the faulty trim servo motor from aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Mr Hobson's case was that there must have been a mistake which he could not explain but which was entirely innocent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Mr Hobson's trip to Adelaide was prompted by his need to have all components of the auto-pilot on aircraft TSO removed, checked, repaired as required, certified and re-installed on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">There is no rational reason apparent on the evidence as to why Mr Hobson instead would choose to take the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC and have it checked, repaired as required, certified and re-installed on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">However, there is an explanation consistent with the records and Mr Hobson having made a mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">It is that Mr Hobson had both trim servo motors out of each aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">He intended to use the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC to fly to Adelaide so the trim servo motor from aircraft TSO could be checked and repaired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">However, he fitted the wrong part to aircraft TSO, gave the wrong part to the repairers in Adelaide and thus re-fitted the wrong part in aircraft ONC on aircraft TSO returning to Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">This sequence of events is consistent with the AirAg additional worksheet that Mr Hobson prepared in which he said (incorrectly) that part 5096 had been re-installed in aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">I consider this the most likely explanation for the circumstances relating to the trim servo motors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">This explanation is consistent with Mr Hobson's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">I should also record that I do not draw any inference adverse to the credit of either Mr Hobson or Mr Harper by reason of matters that emerged in oral evidence but which had not been mentioned in their respective affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">Mr Hobson, in particular, was criticised on this account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">However, Mr Harper's affidavits suffered from the same type of deficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">For example, Mr Harper did not mention the work he had carried out to aircraft ONC which gave the aircraft the appearance of having been gutted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">This evidence was elicited in cross-examination and put a different light on Mr Harper's allegation that Mr Hobson "gutted" aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">It seems to me that the deficiencies in the affidavits of both Mr Hobson and Mr Harper should be accepted as products of poor affidavit preparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Apart from the disputed conversations between Mr Harper and Mr Hobson, the other evidence relevant to the credibility of each is of limited assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Mr Mackey gave evidence about Mr Hobson instructing him to take a tab off a switch on the column of aircraft ONC and installing it on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Such tabs were readily available and cost about $7 or $8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Mr Hobson gave a different version of these events which was not put to Mr Mackey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Nevertheless, if Mr Hobson's evidence that Mr Harper agreed that parts could be borrowed from aircraft ONC provided they were replaced is true, then Mr Mackey's evidence is not necessarily inconsistent with that of Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Mr Criddle gave evidence of having seen Mr Hobson drain fuel from aircraft ONC into a tin of about 500 mL which is consistent with Mr Hobson's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Mr Criddle also said he had seen Mr Hobson inside the cockpit of aircraft ONC and accessing panels on that aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">That too is consistent with Mr Hobson's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Samuel Perry, a pilot of Australian Aerial Surveys, gave evidence that after he flew aircraft TSO to Albury on 12 May 2006 he contacted Mr Hobson about the problem with the left hand engine magneto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Mr Hobson said he had a spare magneto and came down to Albury with the spare on 14 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Mr Perry also saw Mr Hobson in and around the tail section of aircraft ONC on occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Mr Hobson agreed that this conversation with Mr Perry occurred and could not see the difference between telling Mr Perry he had a spare magneto (being that from aircraft ONC) or that he had "access to" a spare magneto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">While part of the surrounding circumstances, none of this evidence undermines Mr Hobson's credibility or particularly assists in resolving the dispute between Mr Harper and Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Accordingly, I have two witnesses (whose general credibility I accept) alleging that each said things the other denies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">As such, this aspect of the dispute also must be resolved by reference to the nature of the matters in dispute, the onus of proof, and the surrounding circumstances capable of assisting in resolution of the issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">I deal with these considerations relevant to the common law claims next.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">If Mr Harper's claims are true, then Mr Hobson has engaged in serious misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">For example, it is part of Mr Harper's case that Mr Hobson tampered with aircraft ONC in such a way as to threaten the safety of the aircraft in breach of s 24 of the Civil Aviation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">A breach of that section is a criminal offence punishable by two years imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">It is also part of Mr Harper's case that Mr Hobson breached numerous provisions of the Civil Aviation Regulations , most of which create criminal offences for breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Apart from these legislative obligations, Mr Harper's case is that Mr Hobson deliberately engaged in a course of conduct involving taking aircraft parts from aircraft ONC to benefit himself without having any permission from Mr Harper (whether express or implied) to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">That in itself is a serious accusation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Insofar as Mr Harper's allegations relate to parts that Mr Hobson admitted borrowing from aircraft ONC, Mr Hobson had the onus of proving consent (G E Dal Pont (general editor).</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Halsbury's Laws of Australia , LexisNexis Butterworths: Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Looseleaf service last updated April 2009, [415-455]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Contrary to Mr Harper's submissions, I do not characterise Mr Hobson's defence as limited to express consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Consent may be express or implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Either way consent is a defence to the torts of conversion and trespass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Insofar as Mr Harper's allegations relate to parts that Mr Hobson denied any involvement in removing, dismantling or otherwise tampering with, Mr Harper had the onus of proving the interference by Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">In both cases, the assessment of the likelihood of facts relevant to the issues having occurred or not is affected by the "the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved" ( Watson v Foxman ) and the effect of the passage of time and subsequent events on the reliability of human memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Relevant surrounding circumstances include the following: 
(1) Mr Hobson has been a LAME for more than 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">From his oral evidence it was apparent that he was familiar with the terms and conditions of his licence and the requirements of the Civil Aviation Act and Civil Aviation Regulations governing his work as a LAME.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Mr Pitt, his employer, considered Mr Hobson to have a "very high standard" in carrying out work to aircraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Although Mr Pitt did not know about the cancellation of Reg-Air's certificate of approval there was no reason for Mr Hobson to have so informed him, particularly given the fact that this occurred in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">(2) Mr Harper was unhappy with the treatment of his aircraft in the first hangar and relocated the aircraft to hangar 273 where Mr Hobson was working on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Until the falling out between Mr Harper and Mr Hobson (which appears to have first arisen in about September 2006), Mr Harper felt free to use Mr Hobson's tools to work on aircraft ONC and to seek Mr Hobson's advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Mr Harper accepted that their relationship was a friendly one (at least before September 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Mr Harper said he had known Mr Hobson for about 10 years in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Before their falling out, Mr Harper also considered that Mr Hobson wanted aircraft ONC to be in good condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Given the lack of invoices (bar the one referred to) it appears that Mr Harper had the benefit of a significant amount of free advice from Mr Hobson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">(3) Mr Harper agreed that aircraft ONC had more hours on its airframe than aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">(4) Mr Harper wanted to use aircraft ONC for charter purposes and sought Mr Hobson's advice (amongst others) about making the aircraft suitable for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Mr Hobson said that he told Mr Harper extensive works were required which Mr Harper agreed to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Mr Harper denied agreeing to do those works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">However, he obtained quotes relevant to such works and agreed that he had dismantled parts of aircraft ONC himself such as to give it an appearance of being gutted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">He started those works in the month or two before aircraft ONC's maintenance release expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Those works meant that aircraft ONC was not airworthy from about May to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">(5) In November 2005 Mr Harper agreed that AirAg could remove the nose wheel doors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The doors were not re-installed until January 2007 by Bankstown Aircraft Maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Mr Harper did not demand re-installation earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Without the nose gear doors aircraft ONC was not airworthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">(6) Mr Harper denied that there was any agreement (express or tacit) between him and Mr Hobson by which Mr Harper could use Mr Hobson's tools and manuals and obtain free advice and Mr Hobson could use parts from aircraft ONC (which was not airworthy) provided he returned and re-installed the parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">However, one part of Mr Harper's cross-examination included the following exchange:
 
Now, there was a battery missing for a period of time and that was lent to a third party?</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Were you aware of that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">I wasn't distressed over it but I wasn't aware of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Is that because - the reason you're saying you're not distressed sir, is because there was a general understanding that on the basis that your aircraft wasn't fit to fly, parts that would assist other aircraft owners could be used provided they were reinstalled?</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Yes, but what point do you go to - they're going to remove my undercarriage and give to someone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">There's a bit of a difference with a battery, same with a nose wheel door.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">There's a bit of difference between a nose wheel door or pulling an engine off or pulling trim motor outer cables and that, there's a significant difference there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Having regard to this evidence I infer that, irrespective of his current recollections, it is more likely than not that Mr Harper, immediately after buying aircraft ONC, was keen to have the aircraft refurbished and upgraded to make it suitable for charter work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Further, that Mr Harper recognised that this would require a substantial investment of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Mr Harper thus attempted to do as much of the work he could himself using Mr Hobson, whom he knew reasonably well and who was a LAME, as a free or cheap source of assistance (knowledge, tools, manuals and help) insofar as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">To that end, Mr Harper dismantled the parts of the aircraft thereby giving it a "gutted" appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Mr Harper did this work in the month or two before the aircraft's maintenance release expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">I infer that Mr Harper must have known that the work he wanted to do would take some time, with the aircraft not being airworthy during the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">I infer also that during this period Mr Harper had many discussions with Mr Hobson, and regularly drew on Mr Hobson's expertise, tools and (perhaps) manuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">In these circumstances I consider it more likely than not that, by his words and conduct (whether or not in the words attributed to him by Mr Hobson, which Mr Hobson acknowledged he could not recall clearly), Mr Harper generally consented to Mr Hobson borrowing parts from aircraft ONC while it was not airworthy provided the parts were re-installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Mr Harper appears not to have expected this arrangement to involve parts he considered significant but Mr Hobson, as a LAME, may well have had a different expectation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Either way, I consider the evidence supports an inference that (at the least) Mr Harper impliedly consented to Mr Hobson allowing Mr Hobson to borrow parts from aircraft ONC while it was not airworthy and subject to the parts being returned and re-installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Accordingly, Mr Hobson has discharged his onus of establishing consent to the borrowing of those parts which Mr Hobson admitted borrowing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">It is true that Mr Hobson did not return one part (the trim servo motor) whereas all other parts were returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">As discussed, I accept that Mr Hobson re-installed the incorrect part into aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Mr Hobson accepted his responsibility for this error and offered to pay the cost of overhauling the trim servo motor installed into aircraft ONC (of $671 according to an invoice).</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">The evidence does not establish that Mr Hobson intended to keep aircraft ONC's trim servo motor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Nevertheless, I am satisfied that, by his error, Mr Hobson deprived Mr Harper of his right to possession of trim servo motor 5096.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Mr Hobson thus, by his mistake, converted trim servo motor 5096 to his own use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">These facts do not constitute trespass to the trim servo motor because, at the time of the mistake of converting the motor to his own use, Mr Hobson in fact had possession of the part, not Mr Harper (see Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd v Elliott [1946] HCA 46 ; (1946) 74 CLR 204 at 226).</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Nevertheless, they do amount to conversion (because installing the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC into aircraft TSO was a serious interference to Mr Harper's right to possession of that part and, obviously, not authorised by the consent I have found Mr Harper to have given).</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">In Butler v Egg &amp; Egg Pulp Marketing Board [1966] HCA 38 ; (1966) 114 CLR 185 at 191 Taylor and Owen JJ observed that the principle governing damages for conversion, in common with all torts, is that "the injured party should receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do so, will put him in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed or the tort had not been committed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Further, (also at 191) that: 
 ...this principle is as much applicable to actions of conversion as it is to the case of other actionable wrongs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">In most cases of conversion it is, of course, obvious that its application will result in the injured plaintiff recovering the full value of the property converted since that will usually represent the loss that he has sustained by the defendant's wrongful act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Hence the statement which appears so often in the books that the general rule is that the plaintiff in an action of conversion is entitled to recover the full value of the goods converted, but this statement should not be allowed to obscure the broad principle that damages are awarded by way of compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">

 According to Mr Harper the cost of acquiring and installing a new trim servo motor would be in the order of $1500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">I consider that this amount represents the proper assessment of Mr Harper's damage having regard to the applicable principles of compensation (and it should be noted in this regard, that Mr Harper did not suggest he had made any demand for the return of the part).</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">This is consistent with the approach that, in effect, subjects a person who has converted goods to a forced purchase of them at their full value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">In submissions, Mr Hobson's counsel accepted that the amount of $1500 would be the appropriate sum by way of damages with respect to this part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Insofar as Mr Harper's allegations related to parts with which Mr Hobson denied any interference, I am not satisfied that Mr Harper has discharged his onus of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Mr Harper himself undertook substantial works to aircraft ONC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">Many other people also had access to aircraft ONC over a long period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Mr Hobson admitted borrowing some parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">It is difficult to understand why he would deny having interfered with other parts (such as switches and panels) given his case that Mr Harper generally permitted parts to be borrowed from aircraft ONC, provided they were returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">For these reasons I do not accept Mr Harper's common law claims of trespass and conversion against Mr Hobson other than in respect of the trim servo motor which Mr Hobson inadvertently converted to his own use on aircraft TSO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">It also follows that Mr Harper's claim for exemplary damages cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Another observation
 One further observation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">A number of submissions for Mr Harper referred to Mr Hobson having contravened the Civil Aviation Act and Civil Aviation Regulations in various respects (particularly in relation to record-keeping).</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">The pleadings, however, identify the limited role which these legislative requirements played in Mr Harper's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">According to the second amended statement of claim, these legislative requirements were relevant to the claims about the implied representation (which I have rejected because the making of such a representation was founded on the existence of an agreement between Mr Harper and Reg-Air that I do not accept existed) and the implied warranty (which I have also rejected for various reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">CONCLUSIONS 
 For the reasons I have given, I do not accept any of Mr Harper's claims based on the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Nor do I accept his claims based on trespass to, and conversion of, parts from aircraft ONC other than in one respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Despite the fact that I accept Mr Hobson did not intend to keep the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC, I am satisfied that he installed that trim servo motor into aircraft TSO and, in so doing, committed the tort of conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">Damages to compensate Mr Harper for that conversion are assessed in the sum of $1500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Otherwise Mr Harper's claims against the respondents are dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">For the purpose of making final orders the parties are to file agreed orders reflecting the reasons for judgment within 7 days (including any costs order if agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">If the costs order or other terms of the orders cannot be agreed, the parties are to file their competing orders within 7 days and, within the same period, are to nominate an agreed date for a short hearing on costs at 9.15 am or 9.30 am within a further 7 days thereafter.</sentence>
