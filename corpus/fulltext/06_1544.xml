<sentence id="s21">' 
 


 
3 The appellant's claims for a Protection Visa assert a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appellant claimed to be an Awami League member and official who feared persecution from members and supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ('BNP').</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He claimed an extensive connection with the Awami League.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He claimed that his father had been active in politics since an early age, and from an early age he had helped his father in relation to political matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The appellant claimed to have worked during the 1996 election for a candidate for the Awami League.</sentence>

 '5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The [appellant] was a leading activist of the Bangladesh Awami League, who entered into politics during my early stage of life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">A number of false cases was filed against the [appellant] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">' 
 


 
6 The Tribunal summarised the appellant's claims: 
 
 'Essentially, it is the [appellant's] claims that he is an Awami League member and official who fears persecution from supporters and members of the BNP (he also referred in passing to Jamat-e Islami, as members of the ruling coalition, and the authorities acting at the behest of the coalition parties).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He has been subject to past harm, namely: (a) death threats following a meeting in July 2001, if he refused to abandon the AL and its processions, (b) death threats if he did not join the BNP, (c) false charges orchestrated by the BNP and (d) beatings at a number of processions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This past harm (including the ongoing nature of the false charges), his continued interest in AL matters and current independent information concerning the treatment of AL activists in Bangladesh all lead the Applicant to fear further persecution for reason of his political opinion if he returns to Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' 
 

7 One particular aspect of the appellant's history requires specific reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The appellant claimed in his Protection Visa application that he had been employed by the Organisation of Development Program for the Underprivileged ('ODPUP') in Dhaka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He claimed that this information was obtained to assist him to obtain a Visitors' Visa for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In fact, according to the appellant, he had never worked for the ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">8 At the conclusion of the second hearing, the Tribunal with the appellant's consent, and in his presence, telephoned ODPUP to inquire about the appellant's employment status with that organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Prior to the call, the Tribunal Member said to the appellant: 
 
 'If they answer the telephone, I'm not going to tell them why you are here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I'm just going to ask if they know you and if they can tell me if you've worked for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That's all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">So I'm not going to compromise any of your privacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 

9 In the course of the call, the Tribunal Member said, ' I'd just like to ask you a question, please.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Do you know [the appellant]?'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">After some questioning, the Member asked, ' I would like to know if he once worked with you '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">And later, the Tribunal Member said, ' I think he was once working with ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I'd like to know can you confirm that for me?</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">And then, after some questioning, the Member asked, ' No, no, no, when was he working there before, was it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">ODPUP answered, ' Two years before '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Member said, ' Okay, and for how long, sir?</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Was he working one year?</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">ODPUP replied, 'Yes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
10 At the first hearing, the appellant did tell the Tribunal that he had worked at ODPUP ' for a short time '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Subsequent to the second hearing, he forwarded a letter from the current Executive Director of ODPUP, in which the author claims that he had known the appellant since 1995, and confirms that the appellant had never worked there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">11 The question of employment by ODPUP is relevant because of the unlikelihood of employment by a Non Government Organisation ('a NGO') in Dhaka of a person who is at the claimed level of involvement in the Awami League, namely a 'leading activist', and is described by the appellant himself as being engaged in full-time activities for the Awami League.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">As the Tribunal noted, it also may have a relevance to the appellant's credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">12 The Tribunal wrote to the solicitor for the appellant on 5 August 2005, three days after the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The body of that s 424A letter was in these terms:
 
 'At the Tribunal hearing held on Tuesday, 2 August 2005, you were given information that would, subject to any comments you make, be the reason, or part of the reason, for deciding that you are not entitled to a Protection Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 
 The Tribunal drew to your attention information on your protection visa application, which was received on 30 October 2001 and had been completed with the assistance of your current adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">With respect to your past employment, you wrote on that application form "12/09-07/01: ODPUP --- North Badda, Gulsun, Dhaka --- Community Counsellor --- Tk 4,000 (monthly salary)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 At the hearing, the Tribunal expressed its interest in contacting ODPUP (Organisation of development Program for Underprivileged) in Dhaka to clarify your employment status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">With your consent and in your presence, it telephoned the Dhaka Office of ODPUP on the following telephone number: +880-2-9883470.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It obtained this telephone number from the Care Bangladesh website (http://www.carebd.org/pngo.html) which lists partner organisations, and which gives three telephone numbers for ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">As you will be aware, a person on that telephone line confirmed in English that he worked for ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">On checking, he advised that you no longer worked there, but that you did previously (perhaps two years ago) and that you had worked there for a period of perhaps one year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 Your statement on your protection visa application and the telephone advice from ODPUP in Dhaka contradict your claims at the Tribunal hearings in March 2003 (when you said you worked only briefly for ODPUP) and in August 2005 when you said that you did not have any paid work after high school, but instead paid the Executive Director of ODPUP to list you as an employee so that you could obtain an Australian visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 This information is relevant because (a) it indicates that you were employed by an NGO in Dhaka, contrary to your claimed level of involvement in the Awami League in Narsingdi (described by your adviser as a "leading activist" and represented by yourself as being engaged in full-time activities), and (b) it may cast doubt on your credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 You are invited to comment on this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Your comments are to be in writing and in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">They are to be received at the Tribunal by close of business on 19 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 IF YOU DO NOT GIVE COMMENTS BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON 19 AUGUST 2005 THE TRIBUNAL MAY MAKE A DECISION ON THE REVIEW OF YOUR CASE WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 At hearing, the Tribunal agreed to your adviser's request to provide a submission on any relevant matter by COB 16 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In accordance with section 424A of the Act, the Tribunal is now inviting you to comment in writing on the information above by 19 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">You may, if you wish, provide information on other relevant matters in your response to this letter (on or before 19 August 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">' 
 

13 In respect to the s 424A letter of 5 August 2007, the appellant forwarded to the Tribunal a letter headed 'To Whom it May Concern' from the Executive Director of ODPUP dated 9 August 2005, which said, '[the appellant] is known to me since 1995, but I would like to mention here that he was not any kinds of employee of our any project or Organization.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 
14 It is clear that the Tribunal did not accept that this statement was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">15 The Tribunal concluded: 
 
 'The [appellant's] account of having paid an NGO Executive Director in 2001 to "show" him as an employee is, in the Tribunal's opinion, plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">However, the [appellant's] replication of this information in his protection visa application (when it no longer served the purpose of securing a visitors visa) and the Tribunal's recent confirmation of his employment at ODPUP in an unsolicited telephone enquiry lead the Tribunal to conclude that he did in fact work there for at least some significant period in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">' 
 

16 The Tribunal expressed its decision as follows: 
 
 'The Tribunal finds that the [appellant] is a low level supporter of the AL, and not an office-bearer, activist or in any other manner an active member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">

 ...
 
 ... the Tribunal accepts that the [appellant] is an AL supporter and that he has a low level of interest in the party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Tribunal is not satisfied that he has suffered past harm as a result of such political interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The [appellant] is free to continue his support for the AL if he returns to Bangladesh, and faces no more than a remote and insubstantial possibility --- hence, no real chance --- of persecutory or other harm should [he] wish to pursue his political interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The material before the Tribunal does not indicate any other grounds for refugee claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Tribunal therefore concludes that he does not have a well-founded fear of Convention-related persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He is not a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">' 

 
 
17 The appellant filed an application for review in the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That application set out five grounds of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">18 At the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant was represented by counsel, who, effectively, abandoned those grounds, and sought to rely only upon grounds raised in the written submissions by counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">19 The Federal Magistrate summarised those grounds at par 16:
 
 ' [counsel] referred... to the Tribunal's findings about whether or not the [appellant] had worked for the ODPUP and how that impacted upon his claims to have been a full time politician.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He raised concerns about the Tribunal's findings of the extent of the [appellant's] knowledge of the Awami League and illustrated that by reference to the transcript of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He referred also to the [appellant's] answers to the questions asked of him about the false charges issue, and took issue with the method used by the Tribunal for asking questions about this issue in a speculative way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The difficulty with asking speculative questions, to summarise his argument, is that it produces speculative answers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">And if a person in reply to a speculative question provides a speculative answer, it can hardly be a criticism because that is what the [appellant] was asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">' 
 

20 Concerning the application for Judicial Review, the Federal Magistrate said at pars 19 --- 20:
 
 '19...</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is noteworthy that the Tribunal did accept the [appellant's] involvement with the Awami League, but did not accept the fact that he had engaged in an increasing level of political activity on behalf of the League, which culminated in his election as vice president of a particular committee in the year 2000, the year before he came to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The question of credibility, as I said, is a factual question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In my view, it was open to the Tribunal to make a finding that the [appellant's] seniority in the League or his involvement in the League, or the extent of his work as an activist with the League was not as great as the [appellant] put it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">To my mind, this is, ... a merits review question and it is not a matter that is therefore susceptible to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">' 
 

21 After a careful examination of the grounds advanced by counsel, Scarlett FM found that there was no jurisdictional error in the reasons of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">22 At the hearing of this appeal, the appellant relied on the three grounds contained in a document styled 'Amended Notice of Appeal', namely:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Federal Magistrate made a mistake in finding that there was no error in the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Federal Magistrate failed to find that the Tribunal denied me natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The Federal Magistrate failed to find that the Tribunal's s424A letter contained incorrect information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">' 
 


 
23 In support of those grounds of appeal, the appellant relied on written submissions, which fairly encapsulate the submissions he makes concerning both the proceedings before the Tribunal, and the review by Scarlett FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">24 In respect of the proceedings before the Tribunal, the applicant submitted: 
 
 
 '3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The Tribunal made some mistakes when it assessed my claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Those mistakes are as follows: 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The Tribunal used wrong information in it's s424A letter dated 5 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">On that date the Tribunal wrote that the Tribunal received information via telephone from ODPUP that I worked in that organization two years ago for one year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The Tribunal gave that information to me in writing and informed that it was reason or part of the reason to affirm the decision that is under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">I responded to that letter on 17 August 2005 and attached a letter from the Director of ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Both my letter and the letter from the Director of ODPUP confirmed that I did not work for ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 Denial of natural justice by the RRT 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I believe that the Tribunal erred in determining that the information it relied on in deciding my credibility was not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Tribunal claimed that it received information that I worked for ODPUP two years ago for at least one year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">However, the Tribunal also had information that I arrived in Australia on 1 October 2001, applied for a protection visa on 30 October 2001, and the Tribunal made that phone call to ODPUP on 2 August 2005, some three years ten months and one day after my arrival in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">There was no evidence before the Tribunal that I departed Australia since my arrival in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Therefore, it was impossible for me to work for that organization two years ago when I was not present in that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Tribunal had a duty to judge its own information before it decides to send a s424A notice, which the Tribunal failed to perform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I strongly protested to the Tribunal that I did not work for ODPUP during the hearing and also after the hearing by sending letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I provided a letter from the Executive Director of ODPUP which the Tribunal did not accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">However, the Tribunal did not inform me that it was not willing to accept that letter from the Executive Director of ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I believe that if the tribunal informed about it's stand in relation to that letter, I could have done more to prove my credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">However, that did not occur and it was a denial of natural justice from the side of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">...' 
 
 

25 Concerning the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant submitted:
 
 
 '10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Federal Magistrate failed to find that there was a significant denial of natural justice by the Tribunal in not giving me an opportunity to know that it did not accept the letter from the Executive Director of ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Federal Magistrate also erred in not observing that the S424A letter from the Tribunal was plainly incorrect, based on which the entire credibility issue was decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I believe that the Honourable Federal Magistrate also denied me natural justice and the decision was not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">' 
 
 
 

26 The complaint of the appellant concerning the way the Tribunal dealt with the question of involvement of the appellant with ODPUP seems to involve two aspects: the first concerns the correctness of the finding by the Tribunal that the appellant did in fact work for ODPUP, contrary to his later protestations and the letter he provided to the Tribunal subsequent to the s 424A notice; secondly, it seems to be asserted that the Tribunal was under an obligation to inform the appellant that it was not willing to accept that letter from the executive director of ODPUP as truthful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">27 Concerning the first aspect of this complaint, the Tribunal determined that the appellant had given inconsistent accounts of whether he had been employed by ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Tribunal found as a fact that, contrary to his later protestations, he had in fact been employed by ODPUP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">This, in the Tribunals' view, was a telling circumstance against his claims concerning his level of his involvement with the Awami League.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">This is a finding of fact open to the Tribunal on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">There is no error of law in making a wrong finding of fact: Waterford v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510, per Brennan J at 77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">28 Further, as Brennan J said in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at pp 35 - 36: 
 
 'The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">' 
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">)
 

29 The argument expressed in par 7 of the appellant's written submissions (set out above at par 24) is directed at the merits of the issue of employment at ODPUP, and relies on details of chronology to assert that the information relied on in determining the appellant's credibility was not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Not only is this impermissible merits review, but it exhibits a misunderstanding of the significance of the information contained in the telephone call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The Tribunal does not appear to have accepted that the employment of the appellant by ODPUP was for a period of one year, and occurred two years before the telephone call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The significance of the conversation, from the Tribunal's point of view, appears to be that it indicates that the appellant had been employed by ODPUP, as he had claimed in his application for a visa, and which he later denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The fact of that employment brought into serious question the claimed fear of persecution for political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">30 The appellant, in his written submissions, referred to Waco v Minister Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 (' Waco ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In Waco , the Full Court of the Federal Court (Lee, Hill, Carr JJ) held at par 54:
 
 'Where a finding of fact made does not turn upon the credibility of the appellant and where there is nothing on the face of the documents themselves to alert the decision maker that they are forgeries, it is likewise inherently unfair that the decision maker conclude that they are not genuine without affording the person affected by that conclusion the opportunity of dealing with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">' 
 
 
 
 Such action amounts to a denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">

31 In Waco , after the Tribunal hearing, the appellant had submitted further evidence, being two letters written in Arabic and translations of the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Both letters corroborated a critical element of his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The Tribunal found that the letters were false documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">However, at no time did the Tribunal give any indication to the appellant that it doubted the genuineness of the letters, and the appellant was, at no time, invited to comment on the authenticity of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">32 The issue in Waco was the authenticity of the letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In this case, there was no issue as to the authenticity of the letter supplied by the appellant to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">What the Tribunal did was reject the correctness of the statement in the letter, having regard to the other evidence that was before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">There was no obligation on the Tribunal to inform the appellant that it disputed the correctness of the statement made in the letter supplied by the appellant to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">33 As to the second aspect of the complaint contained in the letter (set out in par 24 above), namely, that the Tribunal was under an obligation to inform the appellant that it was not willing to ' accept the letter from the Executive Director of ODPUP ', the short answer is that the Tribunal was not under any such obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">34 A Tribunal is not required to tell the appellant its thought processes or conclusions before it makes adverse findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Section 424A(1) of the Act requires the Tribunal to disclose 'information' of a certain kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">35 Allsop J said in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at par 205: 
 
 
 205 Information is that of which one is told or apprised; it is knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject or event: The Complete Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed, 1991).</sentence>
