<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The plaintiff, Bell IXL Investments Limited, holds the largest parcel of shares in the capital of the first defendant, Life Therapeutics Limited (LFE).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It acquired those shares on the ASX between 14 May and 4 June 2008, at an average price of $0.085 per share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Bell IXL's shares together with those of its associate, K Pagnin Pty Ltd, represent about 10.17 per cent of the issued capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">After its initial series of acquisitions Bell IXL lodged a notice of substantial shareholding and on 12 June 2008 it gave notice that it would convene a meeting of LFE shareholders to consider replacing the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The meeting will be held on 23 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Recently LFE allotted a parcel of shares to Bell Potter Nominees Limited, the third defendant, at an issue price of $0.07 per share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The allotment gives Bell Potter 13.04 per cent of the voting shares and reduces the plaintiff's interest to 8.85 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Bell IXL contends that the allotment is invalid and seeks an order that the register of members be rectified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The ground upon which the relief is sought is that the power to allot shares was not exercised bona fide in the interests in LFE but for the illegitimate purpose of keeping the directors in office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 LFE is a holding company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Through its US subsidiaries LFE collects and sells blood plasma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It employs 420 people who work out of 12 plasma collection centres in a number of US cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The operations are not profitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In the half year ended 31 December 2006 LFE lost US$8 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">During the same period last year (2007) it lost US$1.2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The decrease in losses was in part due to increased revenues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the main, however, it resulted from the sale for US$5.9 million of two collection centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">3 In December 2007 the then directors of LFE retained Camino Capital Pty Ltd to provide the company with strategic advice including advice in relation to the sale of assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 17 December 2007 Camino advised that LFE should dispose of the entirety of its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The obvious purchaser was Octapharma AG, a Swiss company that was LFE's largest customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Riddell, a director of Camino, commenced negotiations with Octapharma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This resulted in an offer on 12 February 2008 that Octapharma purchase the plasma centres and associated assets for US$45.6 million plus stock at valuation, less any amount charged on the assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">4 Around this time (February 2008) Mr Bellman (who later became chairman) and Mr Milne replaced the former directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The new directors decided that LFE should not accept the Octapharma offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Still, something had to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">LFE's financial position was precarious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In the absence of a sale of assets the group was insolvent and would be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The new directors decided to continue negotiations with Octapharma to see whether a better arrangement could be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">5 Within two weeks a new arrangement was concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It consisted of three separate agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">First there was a management agreement pursuant to which Octapharma was appointed to manage the US operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Second was a loan agreement under which Octapharma agreed to provide a US$37.1 million loan facility which would be used to pay existing debts and under which Octapharma agreed to lend LFE an amount equal to the operating costs of the US subsidiaries less the revenue received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Finally there was a put and call option which, subject to shareholder approval, gave Octapharma the option to purchase the shares in the US subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The exercise price was around US$47.1 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">6 The effect of the arrangement was that before any sale of the US subsidiaries to Octapharma, LFE had funds to pay out its creditors with a resulting balance of approximately US$16 million of loan funds which it could draw down, and Octapharma was responsible for managing the US operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">If the sale of the US subsidiaries goes ahead, LFE would be required to repay its loan to Octapharma which would leave it with a balance of about $7 or $8 million in cash on my calculation and no other assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 LFE paid out its creditors with the loan funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It drew down the balance and placed the money on deposit with its banker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There was good reason to draw down the full amount under the loan facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The rate of interest payable under the loan agreement was between 2 and 3 per cent, reflecting prevailing US interest rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Funds deposited in an interest bearing account with an Australian bank attracted a much higher rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">8 Following the announcement of the Octapharma transaction, Messrs Bellman and Milne discussed with Mr Riddell the desire of LFE to raise further capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">They told him that they wanted LFE to raise between $5 and $20 million which, together with the funds on hand following the completion of the sale of the US subsidiaries, would allow the company to pursue other ventures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Both Mr Bellman and Mr Milne had in mind that LFE would become an "investment vehicle".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">This required further capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">They asked for Comino's assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">9 Mr Riddell discussed a possible investment in LFE with Mr Currie of Zeus Capital Limited, a London investment bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Zeus operates in the capital raising market and was looking to invest funds in the Asia-Pacific region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There was a telephone call between Messrs Bellman, Milne and Currie in March or April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Nothing was agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Towards the end of April, Comino's retainer was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">10 Octapharma exercised its call option on 11 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This imposed an obligation on LFE to convene a meeting of its shareholders as soon as possible to consider whether they would approve the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">LFE has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide an independent expert's report and Ernst &amp; Young to produce an investigating accountant's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is anticipated that the reports will be to hand by the end of July and that the shareholder meeting will be held in early August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">11 On 1 May 2008 another director joined the board of LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Ms Calhoun, who has experience in human resources and employee relations, was introduced to LFE by one of its consultants, Mr Sharp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">She was told that the company was considering what to do following the sale of its US assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">She was also told that the company wanted to raise finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Ms Calhoun spoke with Mr Bellman who confirmed what she had been told by Mr Sharpe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">She agreed to be appointed a director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">12 The directors (now Messrs Bellman and Milne and Ms Calhoun) discovered on 19 or 20 May 2008 that Bell IXL had acquired a substantial shareholding in LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">They were concerned that Bell IXL might want to take control of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Ms Calhoun said there "was a view that [taking control] probably was Bell's intention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">She also said the directors had "been caught on the hop" by Bell IXL's acquisition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The directors' suspicion about Bell IXL's motives were confirmed when on 23 May 2008 LFE received the requisition for the meeting that will consider replacing the board with Bell IXL's nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">13 There was a directors' meeting on 20 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The minutes make no mention of Bell IXL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">They do, however, record a resolution that at future meetings there will be tabled a "Top Twenty Shareholder Report, Shareholder Movement Report [and] all notices of changes in substantial shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">" Presumably the directors did not again want to be "caught on the hop".</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">14 On the same day as the meeting Messrs Bellman and Milne met Mr Booth of Asandas, a licensed stock broker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The meeting had been arranged by Mr Milne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He had known Mr Booth for some years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Before the meeting Mr Milne told Mr Booth that he and Mr Bellman had recently become directors of LFE, that LFE conducted a blood plasma business in the United States which had been "sending the company to the wall", that the business had been sold at a price which would leave the company with about US$27 million and that LFE was "looking for investors who might provide capital to the company for on-going activities in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">" 
 
15 The meeting was held in Asandas' office in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Mr Bellman and Mr Booth were in attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Ms Calhoun did not go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She had been told that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a capital raising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Ms Calhoun knew "in general terms" that Mr Bellman and Mr Milne were looking to obtain extra finance with the assistance of a financial adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">She was happy to leave it to them to deal with the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In any case, Ms Calhoun had flown in from Perth to attend the board meeting and had to return later that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">She said if she had not needed to return to Perth she would probably have attended the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">16 It is important to establish precisely what was said at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">While three people attended only two, Mr Bellman and Mr Booth, have given evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I do not know why Mr Milne was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">And Mr Booth tried to give the appearance of having only a vague recollection of the discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">17 According to his affidavit Mr Booth was told that LFE's business "had been running down" but that if shareholders approved the Octapharma transaction "the company would have a future".</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He was also told that once the Octapharma transaction was completed there would be other opportunities for the company to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Importantly he said he was told that the company "did not want to touch the ... Octapharma monies (held by the company as cash on deposit) as if shareholders did not approve the transaction, the company's overall position would be even worse [than it already was].</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">" For this reason, LFE had to raise additional funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Booth also remembers being told that the company had a large shareholder who held about 7 per cent of the issued stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">18 Mr Booth made notes of the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">They record the number of shares LFE had on issue, the then current share price, details of what seem to be head office expenses and the expected receipts from the Octapharma transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There is a note in the top right hand corner which reads:
 "280 - 8% - 50%" 
 It is not clear what this note is intended to record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Mr Booth said he could not remember.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">19 Mr Booth had in mind approaching Aegis Partners Limited, an investment group operating out of London, as a potential investor in LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Mr Booth had previously dealt with Mr Waller, an Aegis representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">At approximately 6.02pm on 3 June 2008, Mr Booth sent an email to Mr Waller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The contents of the email are important so I will set it out in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The email reads:
 "AW, Suggest you have a look @ LFE, listing in OZ, I know the fellow well there, same situation sort of as Acclaim, Big Pile of Cash and liquids, Capped at 9 million, with 18 in cash, sitting at Stgeorge cash mgmt, The directors have few shares and want to do a placement to hold on, 15%, They have a group who has bought 7% and obviously want the shell We could do this 15%, they said board seat no problem and change of activity no problem, they don't want to lose their shell, Call me at home 61 2 9363 4828 TB" 
20 This email is important both for what it says and for what it does not say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">First, I will deal with the omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There are several things a prudent investor would want to know about a company in which he was being offered a 15 per cent stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">They include such basic information as what the company does, and what are its assets and liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In the case of LFE a prudent investor would also want to know something about the Octapharma deal and the likelihood of it being approved by shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He might also want to know what would happen to LFE if the sale of the US subsidiaries was not approved by shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Not only would a prudent investor want to know these things a sensible adviser would provide that kind of information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The email contains none of this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Mr Booth did not have a satisfactory explanation for the omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He did say he thought Mr Waller would make his own enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I do not believe that is what Mr Booth believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">21 I do believe that if an investor was being asked to take up shares in a "cash box" type company to assist management in maintaining control he might only be told enough to establish there is sufficient cash in the company to get back the purchase price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Although no price is mentioned in the email, the clear implication is that LFE has sufficient capital to enable Aegis to recover the purchase price if things go wrong and it is wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">22 Enough was said in the email to attract Mr Waller's interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He replied to Mr Booth within three hours stating: "Let's do it boss".</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">23 When Bell IXL obtained a copy of the email in response to a subpoena served on Asandas, it likely thought that its tender would result in success in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The legal principles involved are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Directors of a company are only entitled to issue shares for reasons that relate to a purpose of benefiting the company: Ashburton Oil NL v Alpha Minerals NL [1971] HCA 5 ; (1971) 123 CLR 614 , 640; Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483 , 493.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Raising capital when there is a need for additional funds is a legitimate purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Conversely, raising capital by the issue of voting shares for purposes, or for the predominant purpose, of buttressing the position of directors is an illegitimate use of the directors' power: Whitehouse v Carlton Hotel Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 11 ; (1987) 162 CLR 285 , 289.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">If the email reflects what Mr Booth was told by Messrs Bellman or Milne, the placement was not intended to benefit LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Its purpose was to keep the directors in office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">24 On this score, however, Mr Bellman says that Mr Booth got it wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">His evidence is that he did not tell Mr Booth that shares were to be issued so that the directors would not "lose [control of] the shell".</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">He said that matter played no part in his discussions with Mr Booth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Bellman said that apart from telling Mr Booth about the Octapharma transaction he told him he was looking for investors so that LFE could "move forward into the future".</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He said that he had in mind two rounds of capital raising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">According to the ASX Listing Rules, subject to certain exceptions a listed company is only permitted to issue up to 15 per cent of its capital unless it obtains shareholder approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">An allotment of 15 per cent of the capital on LFE would raise only around $1.35 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">This would not be enough to cover LFE's annual operating expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It is for that reason Mr Bellman said he was contemplating two rounds of capital raising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In reality, even a second round without shareholder approval would not raise enough for investment purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">To avoid the listing rule restriction LFE would need to make a pro rata offer to existing shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Bellman said that a pro rata issue would be "a highly desirable way to go" but that it is "a stretch" to think such a strategy might have worked, given the fall in LFE's share price since most investors bought in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Nothing that Mr Bellman has said suggests that he would seriously consider such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">25 Moreover, it is surprising that Mr Bellman does not remember telling Mr Booth the company was anticipating two rounds of funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Booth said nothing about it in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">If, as Mr Bellman would have it, there was a need for further capital to fund LFE's future operations, surely this would have been discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">26 On the other hand, as I have said, the emergence of a substantial shareholder was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Mr Booth was told that someone had acquired 7 per cent of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Although pressed by Mr Shaw who appeared for the plaintiffs, he was not able to give details of what was said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">He was also pressed by Mr Shaw to explain why he told Mr Waller that the directors wanted to hold onto the company, that they did not want to lose the shell and that they were willing to give a board seat to the person who took a placement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">But Mr Booth could not explain why he had written these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">He was adamant that he had not been told "directly" what he had written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He could not, though, explain what was said that led him to form the view that what he had written was the position taken by the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">27 I am sure that Mr Booth was not guessing what the directors' motives were in seeking an investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">A broker of 24 years experience (which is how long Mr Booth has been in the industry) would not make the statements he did to a prospective investor unless he was confident they were true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I have no doubt that Mr Booth recorded what he was told or what was properly to be inferred from the comments made by Mr Bellman or Mr Milne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The impression I have of Mr Booth's evidence on this aspect is that he did not want to answer questions in a way that would harm LFE's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I should say that if Mr Booth was at any time told that LFE did not want to spend borrowed money to meet current expenses (in fact I doubt that he was told this), that comment was made in the context of exploring an excuse for a small capital raising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">28 Nothing I have said is intended to indicate I reject Mr Bellman's evidence that he wanted to create a future for LFE and to achieve that future it was necessary to complete the Octapharma transaction and to raise additional capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The completion of the sale was well underway when Bell IXL appeared on the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">A capital raising was a step that would logically be undertaken after the completion of the sale because in the unlikely event that shareholders voted against the sale there would be no need for any additional capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The presence of Bell IXL had the potential to thwart Mr Bellman's intentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I think Ms Calhoun hit the nail on the head when, in answer to the question, "[T]he directors wanted to keep control of the company, didn't they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">", she replied: "The directors would probably like to finish what they started in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">That was probably more the motivation, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">" Put differently, while Mr Bellman's general objective was to further the interests of LFE, his immediate object was to ensure that the directors were not removed so that the general objective could be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">29 Several events confirm my view that what motivated the share issue was Mr Bellman's desire to keep himself and the other directors in office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The first requires reference to further facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I have already pointed out that Mr Waller took only three hours to decide to take the placement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He appears to have made his decision without any detailed investigation of LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">In his email Mr Booth offered to discuss the proposed placement by phone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Mr Waller did not bother to make the call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">That suggests that the placement was not a normal commercial investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">This is confirmed by the speed with which Aegis executed the subscription agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The document was prepared by LFE and sent to Mr Booth on 12 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It was immediately sent on to Aegis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Aegis executed the agreement and returned it the same day without negotiating any of the terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Not only is this unusual, it suggests that the parties wanted to complete the placement as a matter of urgency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">30 The next event is the retainer by LFE of Global Proxy Solicitation Pty Ltd. GPS is an organisation that provides "strategic shareholder communications advice and programs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It helps a company ensure that its shareholders "are aware and clearly informed about the merits of any proposals [put by the directors].</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">" It encourages shareholders to "vote in favour of each resolution" put by the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">GPS was appointed on 13 June 2008, the day after the subscription agreement was executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It was paid $60,000 on account of its fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Mr Bellman said that GPS was appointed to assist the company obtaining shareholder approval for the Octapharma sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It transpired, however, that GPS was also soliciting shareholders to vote against the resolution to remove the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">This came to light on the last day of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Mr Bellman said this work was performed under a separate retainer with the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The problem with this evidence is that the first Ms Calhoun knew that it was being asserted that the directors had retained GPS was shortly before she began her evidence on the final day of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">31 It may be that one purpose for retaining GPS was to encourage shareholders to approve the Octapharma deal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Another, and perhaps more immediate purpose, was to prevent Bell IXL obtaining control of LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">32 Finally there are Mr Bellman's dealings with Bell Potter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It turned out that Aegis did not take up any shares in LFE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Instead, on about 9 July 2008 it instructed Bell Potter to take the placement and allocate the shares between its clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">It seems common ground that none of the clients (perhaps with the exception of one) is associated with Aegis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">When Mr Bellman learned that the shares were to be taken by Bell Potter he discussed the matter with Mr Baguley, an officer of Bell Potter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He followed up the discussion with an email which read:
 Further to our conversation, we understand you are sending the substantial shareholder notice today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Also, can you please look at getting the proxy forms completed as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">We don't want to risk leaving this to the last minute Thanks &amp; Regards....................Wayne 
33 I am sure Mr Bellman had in mind receiving a proxy from Bell Potter that would support the existing board at the forthcoming meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In his evidence Mr Bellman said that preparing the proxy form was merely "completing the transaction with Bell Potter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It was much more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Mr Bellman was wanting to secure a favourable vote from Bell Potter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">It is likely that Bell Potter had agreed that it would vote against the removal of the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">That is why Mr Bellman did not want "to risk leaving this [the return of the proxy form] to the last minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">"
 
34 The result is that I must find that the share placement was for an ulterior purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">I will hear the parties on the precise orders that should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In the meantime, as the shareholders' meeting will be held tomorrow I will restrain Bell Potter from exercising the right to vote that attaches to its shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
