 (motions for striking out and summary dismissal) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These reasons relate to motions brought by three amended notices of motion filed on 4 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The motions are brought by the respondent (Veda).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They seek:
 
 
 &#8226; a striking out of certain paragraphs of the amended application in each of three proceedings pursuant to s 33ZF(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA Act);
 &#8226; a striking out of certain paragraphs of the amended statement of claim in each of the proceedings pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules ;
 &#8226; a dismissal of certain claims pursuant to s 31A or s 33ZF(1) of the FCA Act in so far as the claims are based on certain parts of the amended statements of claim; and 
 &#8226; an order pursuant to O 12 r 5(1) of the Federal Court Rules that each applicant supply particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 

2 The three proceedings are three of nine representative proceedings under Pt IVA of the FCA Act against Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The present three relate to events in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Three of the others relate to events in Victoria and the remaining three to events in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 All nine are brought by individuals on behalf of themselves and others whose complaints concern information provided by Veda to credit providers relating to the creditworthiness of the applicants and of the group members they respectively represent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Veda is a credit reporting agency, that is to say, it is a corporation that carries on a credit reporting business (I am using expressions taken from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), ss 6 and 11A ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 Credit providers subscribe to Veda in order to have the benefit of information related to the creditworthiness of individuals who apply to them for credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Veda maintains credit information files on a computer database in relation to individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The credit providers who subscribe are able to access, by computer, the credit information files that are part of the system set up by Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In addition, the subscribers themselves may update the information on those files by providing information known to them concerning individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 Accordingly, Veda's subscribers are both the suppliers of information to the credit information files and the recipients of information from those files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I was told that on the final hearing there will be considerable evidence concerning the way in which the system just outlined operates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 In the way in which the proceedings have been cast, each of the three relates to the reporting of a particular kind of problem associated with a person's creditworthiness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In the case of proceeding NSD 368/2007 in which Ms Szyczew is the applicant, the complaint is that the word "Bankrupts" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Ms Szyczew and the members of the group on whose behalf she sues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the case of proceeding NSD 371/2007 in which Mr Bailey is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Bailey and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I infer that what is meant by those expressions is that the person, owing money, has ceased to be contactable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In proceeding NSD 393/2007 in which Mr Knochell is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Payment Default" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Knochell and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 In each of the three proceedings, claims are made of contravention by Veda of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act), defamation and negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">THE DEFINITION OF THE CLAIM GROUP --- PARAGRAPHS 1 AND 2 OF THE AMENDED NOTICES OF MOTION 
 
8 Section 33C(1) of the FCA Act provides:
 
 (1) Subject to this Part, where: 
 
 
 (a) 7 or more persons have claims against the same person; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the claims of all those persons are in respect of, or arise out of, the same, similar or related circumstances; and
 (c) the claims of all those persons give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact; 
 
 
 
 
 a proceeding may be commenced by one or more of those persons as representing some or all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 
 

9 Section 33H of the FCA Act provides:
 
 
 (1) An application commencing a representative proceeding, or a document filed in support of such an application, must, in addition to any other matters required to be included: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates; and
 (b) specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group members and the relief claimed; and
 (c) specify the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) In describing or otherwise identifying group members for the purposes of subsection (1), it is not necessary to name, or specify the number of, the group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 

Order 73 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules provides that a representative proceeding must be commenced by filing an application in accordance with Form 129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The contents of Form 129 are framed with reference to s 33H(1)(a), (b), (c) of the FCA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">That is to say, the applicant must identify the group members (para (a)), the claims made and the relief sought (para (b)), and the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members (para (c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 An unsatisfactory course was followed by the applicants in connection with the motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The amended notices of motion were brought in respect of an "amended application (as at 03.08.07)" filed in each proceeding on 3 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Each applicant then prepared a "proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07)" but it was impossible to address this document because paragraph and subparagraph numbers were repeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The confusing nature of that document came to light after the hearing had begun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The applicants then sought leave, which I granted, to file a notice of motion seeking leave to file a further amended application in the form of the "proposed further amended application as at 03.10.07" in which the paragraph numbering had been corrected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Such a notice of motion was filed in Court on 4 October 2007 in proceeding NSD 371/2007 only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 There were yet further unsatisfactory features of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Counsel for the applicant began by indicating yet further amendments the applicants proposed to make to their applications and statements of claim, and invited counsel for Veda to indicate if he would still have any objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Counsel for the applicants said:
 
 ...we do accept that we need to make some changes there [in relation to group membership], but we submit they are fairly minor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I'll foreshadow the changes that we believe are indicated so that my friend knows what we are proposing to do, so if there's anything else, he can raise it at least at this stage, but it's really just a matter of clearing up a few small aspects, we submit, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

Counsel proceeded to identify changes, apparently expecting counsel for Veda and the Court to address the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) as if it were further amended by what counsel was saying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">12 Counsel for Veda commenced his submission in reply by stating:
 
 It puts your Honour in a very difficult position to make a determination about leave to amend ... when the document before your Honour is being changed, amended, added to and deleted from on the run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

I agree and expressed my agreement at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The result was a direction of the Court that the applicant in each proceeding supply a proposed further amended application and proposed further amended statement of claim incorporating all foreshadowed amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In Mr Bailey's and Mr Knochell's proceedings (NSD 371/2007 and NSD 393/2007) a "proposed further amended application (as at 10.10.07)" and a "proposed further amended statement of claim (as at 10.10.07)" were distributed on 15 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">By consent between the parties, a proposed further amended application and a proposed further amended statement of claim are to be distributed in Ms Szyczew's proceeding (NSD 368/2007) by 7 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">13 The course that has been followed by the applicants has been most unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It creates an intolerable burden on the Court, having heard detailed argument on one document, to have to address a new document and work out which arguments remain relevant and which do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I have no doubt that in these reasons I will refer to some deficiencies that the applicants concede need to be remedied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Moreover, I find it convenient in some instances to refer to parts of superseded documents because the parties' submissions were addressed to them and apparently those parts have been carried forward in the superseding document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">14 As will appear below, Veda succeeds on its motions in many respects and I will give the applicants leave to amend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">However, I will require, as a condition of the exercise of that leave, that the solicitors and counsel for the applicants certify that they have carefully checked any amended documents that are to be filed and that those documents are correct so far as form is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">15 The importance of the identification of the group members on whose behalf a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the FCA Act is brought, and of the specification of the common questions of law and fact hardly needs to be emphasised: see, for example, Bright v Femcare Limited (2002) 195 ALR 574; Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Ltd [2003] FCA 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The reasons for careful identification of the group members have been explained in those two authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">16 I will address the identification of the group in the amended application and amended statement of claim in Mr Bailey's proceeding (NSD 371/2007) but what I say will also relate to the other two proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">17 (1) Paragraph 1 of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) refers to Veda's "databases, credit information files and credit reports", yet the "group membership criteria" that follow refer only to a "credit report".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I accept Veda's submission that a person reading the description would be left in doubt as to whether the person fell within the group if the reference to "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" was in only one of the three, and, in particular, if it appeared only in a database or credit information file but not in a credit report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I understand that the applicant accepts that paragraph 1 must be amended to omit the phrase "databases, credit information files and".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">18 (2) Also in paragraph 1 of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07), the words "more specifically" are embarrassing since they leave unclear whether it is only persons within the six criteria (a) to (f) who satisfy the criteria for group membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The words "more specifically" suggest that there may be two groups: one group that satisfies the words that precede the expression "more specifically" and another that satisfies the words that follow that expression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I note that the phrase still appears in the proposed further amended application (as at 10.10.07).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 (3) Paragraph 1(c) of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) refers to a document "referred to in Schedule A", but there is no Schedule A, other than the one annexed to the proposed further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 (4) Paragraph 1(c) concludes with the words "which ... the Respondent also described in the Respondent's internet user guide as a "serious credit infringement (confirmed clearouts only)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The words are embarrassing surplusage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">21 (5) Schedule "A" to the proposed further amended statement of claim (as at 10.10.07) relates only to the applicant, not to the group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">22 (6) Paragraph 2(f) of the same document wrongly contains "particulars".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">If that which is stated as particulars is truly part of a criterion, multiple groups are suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The applicant might well consider omitting the particulars entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">23 The defects referred to in (1) and (4) above are repeated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the existing amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">PURPORTED COMMON QUESTIONS OF FACT OR LAW --- PARAGRAPH 1 OF THE AMENDED NOTICES OF MOTION 
 
24 Paragraph 4 of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) in Mr Bailey's proceeding (NSD 371/2007) begins:
 
 The questions of fact common to the claims of the Applicant and the group members are --- 
 
 
 (i) The facts, matters and circumstances pleaded in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22 of the Amended Statement of Claim ("ASOC") --- particularly, but not limited to, the Respondent's method of business as pertaining to the Respondent's "Honour System" (as defined at paras 6(f), 6(g) &amp; 22 thereof).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">More specifically: ...
 
 

25 Paragraph 4 does not pass muster in view of the words "more specifically".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It is not possible to have a m&eacute;lange of "facts, matters and circumstances" which are "more specifically" questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">26 I turn now to the paragraphs of the amended statement of claim referred to in paragraph 4 which Veda contends do not constitute common questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">27 (1) Mr Bates of counsel who argued this aspect of the matter for the applicant conceded that paragraph 7 could not be relied on as stating a question of fact because it posed a question of law as to whether Veda was obliged to take reasonable steps at all material times directed to certain ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">28 (2) Paragraph 9 of the existing amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) relates only to the particular applicant and not to the represented group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">29 (3) I do not accept Veda's criticism that the extrinsic facts referred to in paragraph 10 of the existing amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) do not constitute a common question of fact because I construe that paragraph as meaning that there was only one single internet user guide known to all subscribing credit providers at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">If the evidence shows that the internet user guide to which subscribers had access was in a different form from time to time, the applicant will fail on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, that is an evidentiary matter for the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">As a matter of pleading, the applicant succeeds on the point because he has relied on a single form of internet user guide having been available to subscribers throughout.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">If the applicant accepts that the content of the internet user guide did indeed change from time to time, the applicant will need to seek leave to amend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">30 (4) I agree with Veda that paragraph 15 of the existing amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) does not specify a common question of fact, the suffering of loss and damage being a matter peculiar to the individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">31 (5) Paragraph 19 does not raise a common question of fact for the same reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">32 (6) Paragraph 22 of the existing amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) does not raise a common question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Whether something was "untrue" or "false and misleading" in relation to the applicant and each of the other group members is a question individual to each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">33 (7) Paragraph 4(i) of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) (set out at [24] above) states "more specifically" before it lists six proposed questions of fact, each commencing "Whether ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I have previously sustained the objection to the use of the term "more specifically" (see [18] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">34 I will now address the six questions listed in paragraph 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 (ii) This paragraph does specify a common question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 (iii) As related to a "question", the reference to the particulars to paragraphs 9 and 10 of the amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) is embarrassing, but a common mixed question of fact and law is specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">(iv) Paragraph 12 of the amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07) does not specify a common question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">(v) This paragraph does not specify a common question of fact, although a question of fact may be able to be got out of it if it were reframed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">(vi) This paragraph does specify a common question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">(vii) This paragraph does not specify a common question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 

35 (8) I now turn to the proposed common questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">I will address these by reference to paragraph 5 and its subparagraphs in the proposed further amended application (as at 10.10.07): 
 
 
 (i) Paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) of the amended statement of claim do not plead an obligation owed by Veda to the applicant and to each of the group members , although I think this is implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Generally speaking, the question whether an obligation (I prefer "duty") was owed is a common question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">(ii) This paragraph specifies a common question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">(iii) This paragraph commences "The interaction and proper construction, on the pleaded facts, as between s 52 and s 65A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">More specifically: ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The words "more specifically" are objectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It suffices to say in relation to (a) to (e) that although there is undoubtedly a common question of law in relation to s 65A , it is not appropriately captured in any of these paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">(iv) This paragraph does not specify a common question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It is infected with the "more specifically" defect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The words following "More specifically:" do specify a common question of law, although I do not understand its relevance to the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">(v) This paragraph is again infected by the "more specifically" problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As in (iv), the words following "More specifically:" do specify a common question of law, although, again, I do not understand its relevance to the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 

 IMPUTATIONS --- PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE AMENDED NOTICES OF MOTION 
 
36 Paragraphs in the amended statements of claim (as at 03.08.07) plead imputations alleged to have been conveyed by the disclosure of the applicants' credit reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Each of these subparagraphs follows the same form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">They are as follows:
 
 
 Bailey : "17(f) The Applicant and each other group member is properly described as 'clearout' or 'clearout watched'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Szyczew : "17(b) The Applicant and each Group Member have been unable to pay their debts and were declared bankrupt in the Federal Court through the issue of a Sequestration Order".</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Knochell : "17(d) The Applicant and each other Group Member was not a properly described as having a Payment Default".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">(It was agreed that there is an error in this subparagraph and that the words "not a" should be omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">) 

37 The objection made is that these are not true imputations because, in substance, they simply repeat the express terms "Bankrupts", "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" or "Payment Default" as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Veda relies on Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [83] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In my view the criticism is well made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The pleading does not impute an act to, or state about, the applicant or other group member beyond that which is inherent in the expression used in Schedule "A" to the amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">PUBLICATION BY OR TO A COMPUTER --- THE COMPUTER-TO-COMPUTER ISSUE --- PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE AMENDED NOTICES OF MOTION 
 
38 This issue arises from paragraph 18 of the amended statement of claim (as at 03.08.07).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Paragraph 18 (common to all three proceedings) pleads a case alternative to publication to the minds of officers of the subscribing credit providers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It commences:
 
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">To the extent, if at all (which is not admitted), that the Court found that, notwithstanding the publication of the information in paragraph 16 above, the said information was not read in its entirety by an individual on behalf of the subscribers of the Respondent to whom such information was published, but was interpreted or assessed, wholly or in part, by a computer, which computer recommended that any application for credit be declined, the latter information and/or recommendation was nevertheless published by the Respondent (via computer) to the said subscriber or subscribers of the Respondent, and the said publication was read and comprehended by the said subscribers (by one or more natural persons who were servants or agents of each such subscriber) and conveyed the following imputations ...
 
 

39 On 31 July 2007, Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth, solicitors for Veda, wrote to Gerard Malouf &amp; Partners, solicitors for the applicants, asking them to specify the facts, matters and circumstances relied on in support of the allegation that Veda "nevertheless published" the information and/or recommendation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Gerard Malouf &amp; Partners replied that paragraph 18 spoke for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">40 Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth also noted that they assumed that the "computer" referred to in paragraph 18 was the credit provider's computer, but asked Gerard Malouf &amp; Partners to specify whose computer was referred to if that was not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Gerard Malouf &amp; Partners replied that "It is either the Credit Provider's (subscriber's) computer or the Respondent's computer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">41 It is plain that on the pleading it is the computer of the credit provider (subscriber) only that is referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">On the current pleading I would disallow the applicant to attempt to prove under paragraph 18 as presently formulated any different case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The applicant will need leave to amend if he wishes to have the option of proving a different case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">CLAIM UNDER s 52 OF THE TP ACT AND THE OPERATION OF s 65A OF THE TP ACT --- PARAGRAPHS 5 AND 6 OF THE AMENDED NOTICES OF MOTION 
 
42 By paragraphs 5 and 6 of the amended notices of motion, Veda seeks to have the claims of contravention of s 52 of the TP Act struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In this respect the motions raised an interesting and important issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">That issue is whether the claim of contravention of s 52 of the TP Act cannot succeed by reason of s 65A of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">So far as relevant, s 65A provides:
 
 
 (1) Nothing in section 52, 53, 53A, 55, 55A or 59 applies to a prescribed publication of matter by a prescribed information provider, other than:
 (a) a publication of matter in connection with: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the supply or possible supply of goods or services; 
 
 
 
 (ii) the sale or grant, or possible sale or grant, of interests in land;
 (iii) the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services; or
 (iv) the promotion by any means of the sale or grant of interests in land; 
 
 
 where: 
 
 
 (v) the goods or services were relevant goods or services, or the interests in land were relevant interests in land, as the case may be, in relation to the prescribed information provider; or
 (vi) ... 
 
 
 (b) a publication of an advertisement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">(2) For the purposes of this section, a publication by a prescribed information provider is a prescribed publication if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) in any case -- the publication was made by the prescribed information provider in the course of carrying on a business of providing information; or
 (b) in the case of a person who is a prescribed information provider by virtue of paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of prescribed information provider in subsection (3) (whether or not the person is also a prescribed information provider by virtue of another operation of that definition) -- the publication was by way of a radio or television broadcast by the prescribed information provider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 
 
 (3) In this section:
 prescribed information provider means a person who carries on a business of providing information and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes: 
 
 
 
 (a) the holder of a licence granted under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 ; and
 (aa) a person who is the provider of a broadcasting service under a class licence under that Act; and
 (ab) the holder of a licence continued in force by subsection 5(1) of the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 ; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; and
 (c) the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 
 
 relevant goods or services in relation to a prescribed information provider, means goods or services of a kind supplied by the prescribed information provider or, where the prescribed information provider is a body corporate, by a body corporate that is related to the prescribed information provider.</sentence>

43 Veda submits that it is a prescribed information provider because it provides information in relation to the creditworthiness of individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It submits that the pleaded publication by Veda to its subscribers was a "prescribed publication" because it was made by Veda "in the course of carrying on a business of providing information".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">44 On their face, these two propositions seem straightforward enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">45 Veda submits that the only exception to s 65A that is arguably relevant is a publication of matter in connection with the supply of services where the services were "services of a kind supplied by" Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">46 Senior counsel for the applicant submits that it is inappropriate for this issue to be determined on the present motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">At the foundation of his submission is the special nature of the arrangement by which the information is recorded and supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Subscribers themselves cause information to be included in Veda's database, and access that database directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The argument is, therefore, that Veda is not itself providing the information to the subscribers: they are providing the information to each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">47 I indicated to senior counsel for the applicant that it seemed to me that this argument raised an acute difficulty for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It is plain that according to his amended statement of claim (03.08.07) he has pleaded that Veda collected and supplied information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Indeed, in particulars to paragraph 6 of that pleading, the applicant actually refers to s 65A of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It is not open to the applicant on the existing pleading to run a case that Veda did not supply the information to the credit providers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">48 But let it be assumed that the applicant chose to run that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It would seem to be quite clear that he would then be suing the wrong entity since his case would be that subscribing credit providers were the suppliers of the information, not Veda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">49 Both parties referred me to several authorities in which s 65A of the TP Act has arisen for consideration: Horwitz Grahame Books Pty Ltd v Performance Publications Pty Ltd (1987) 8 IPR 25; Bond v Barry [2007] FCA 1484 ; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Seven Network Limited [2007] FCA 1505.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">None of these cases resolves the issue raised here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">50 As I see it, the applicant must elect between saying, as he says at present, that Veda supplied the information to its subscribing credit providers in the course of carrying on its business, in which case the applicant has sued the right entity but s 65A affords a complete answer to his claim, or saying that rather than Veda providing the information, the subscribing credit providers provided it to each other, in which case s 65A may be circumvented but the applicant would be shown to have sued the wrong entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">51 I would be reluctant to dismiss the claim based on the alleged contravention of s 52 of the TP Act under s 31A of the FCA Act at this stage because Mr Hale SC, senior counsel for the applicant, seemed to suggest that he may wish to amend the pleading to take into account in some way special features of the system operated by Veda with a view to circumventing s 65A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">At present I do not see how he can do so, but I would not wish to deny him the opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">52 If the pleading is not amended, I would propose to grant the relief sought in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the amended notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">CONCLUSION 
 
53 I propose to publish these reasons and give the parties an opportunity to consider them and to address me on the appropriate orders to be made, including orders as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">54 At present I am inclined to the view that certain paragraphs of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) should be struck out with liberty to amend; that the amended statement of claim (03.08.07) should be struck out in its entirety with liberty to file a further amended statement of claim, and that the respective applicants should pay Veda's costs of the motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">As noted above at [14], a condition of the applicants' exercise of the leave to amend would be that the solicitors and counsel for the applicants certify that any amended documents that are to be filed have been carefully checked and found to be correct so far as form is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">55 I would urge the parties to seek to agree on the orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
