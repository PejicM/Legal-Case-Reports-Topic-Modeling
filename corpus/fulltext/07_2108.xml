<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 11 December 2007 a search order was made in these proceedings pursuant to O 25B of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Such orders were formerly described as an Anton Piller order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Those orders were executed on 12 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">During the course of the execution of those orders it became apparent that the number of computers at the premises of the Third and Fourth Respondents was such that copies of the hard drives of those computers could not be completed within the time specified in the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 It is understood that the Third and Fourth Respondents have cooperated with the execution of the orders and are continuing to cooperate with making computers available to the Applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 On 13 December 2007 a Notice of Motion was filed seeking a variation of the order by inserting the following underlined terms into the order previously made, namely:
 
Computers 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">(d) If it will not be possible for the independent computer expert to make a complete copy of any computer hard drive or other storage media at the premises before 6 pm on Thursday, 13 December 2007 the independent computer expert may remove the computer, computer hard drives or other storage media to make a complete copy of that removed item at the premises of the independent computer expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 

 
(e) The independent computer expert must as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the hearing on the return date deliver the copy or digital copy of the computer hard drive or other storage media , all items removed pursuant to order 20(d)(d) above and all electronic hard copies of listed things to the independent solicitor together with a report of what the independent computer expert has done including a list of such electronic and hard copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 When that Motion came before me I declined to make the variation of the order then sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There was uncertainty in the evidence then relied upon as to whether the Third and Fourth Respondents were consenting to an order removing the computers in their entirety or merely consenting to the removal of the hard drives within those computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In any event, given the apparent cooperation of the Third and Fourth Respondents and the absence of any evidence that, if the variation was not made, the evidence would be destroyed, it was not considered that any further order was then justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">6 Orders made pursuant to O 25B of the Federal Court Rules are draconian in nature and such orders will only be made if they are necessary for the preservation of evidence that would otherwise be destroyed or made unavailable: see Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 25B r 3(c)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">See also Addison Wesley Longman Australia Pty Ltd v Copy Stop Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1518.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">7 Junior counsel for the Applicants on 13 December 2007 quite properly accepted that the variation sought was not premised upon any current apprehension of any real possibility that evidence would now be destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The absence of such evidence would make it inappropriate to make an order at the outset: see, eg, AAA Embroidery &amp; Screen Printing Pty Ltd v Dan [2006] FCA 1846.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The absence of such evidence at the time that a variation of an order is sought equally renders it inappropriate to invoke O 25B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">8 Today there has been an appearance for all Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Short minutes of orders have been filed which inter alia seek to substantially implement the variation as previously sought in the Motion .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The variation of the orders as now sought, it is considered, should be made, but not pursuant to O 25B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The orders as previously made pursuant to O 25B have served their purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Order 25B should only be invoked when the Court can be " satisfied " of the requirements set forth in O 25B r 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As at today's date the Court cannot be " satisfie d" of the requirements set forth in O 25B r 3(c)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 Order 25B r 4 makes apparent that nothing in O 25B " diminishes the inherent, implied or statutory jurisdiction of the Court to make a search orde r." The source of the power to vary the order previously made is either O 25 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) or s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to vary the orders previously made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 The Court makes orders in accordance with the short minutes of order dated 14 December 2007 save for Order 2(b) and Order 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Those orders are not pressed by the Applicants.</sentence>
