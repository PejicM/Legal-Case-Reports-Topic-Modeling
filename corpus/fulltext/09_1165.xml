<sentence id="s0">
 Mr John Lelleton is in an unfortunate predicament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He became bankrupt in 1995 and had assumed that, pursuant to the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act"), he had been discharged in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">To his surprise, when he sought to travel overseas earlier this year he was advised that he could not do so because records maintained by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia ("ITSA") disclosed that he remained an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He caused inquiries to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">An examination of Court files and other documents yielded the following information which Mr Lelleton has deposed, on affidavit, to be true and correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He was made bankrupt by order of the Court on 6 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Mr Clyde White was appointed his Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Prior to the hearing on 6 April 1995, Mr Lelleton had filed and served various documents relating to his financial affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">At this time Mr Lelleton was residing with a friend in Sydney although he retained an address in South Yarra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">By letter dated 7 April 1995, Mr White wrote to Mr Lelleton formally advising him that he had been made bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The letter contained the following passage: 
 
 "I enclose a blank copy of the Statement of Affairs for your completion and lodgement with the Registrar in Bankruptcy whose address is 450 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Please provide me with a copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">" 
 

It was received by Mr Lelleton through his address in South Yarra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Lelleton deposes that he completed the Statement of Affairs on 19 April 1995 and, on or about that day, posted the document to the Registrar in Bankruptcy at 450 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The document was posted by pre-paid ordinary mail from a post box in Double Bay in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Despite being asked to do so, Mr Lelleton did not post a copy to Mr White.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Lelleton retained a copy of the Statement of Affairs which he posted to the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That Statement was produced to the Court this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The first two pages appear to be missing but the rest of the lengthy document appears to be intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I note that it contains an instruction, at the end, that the Statement should be filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">There is no intimation that a copy should be sent to the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This may explain Mr Lelleton's failure to provide Mr White with a copy of the Statement of Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Unbeknown to Mr Lelleton, on 16 August 1995, Mr White wrote to the Registrar advising that: 
 
 "To date, I have been unable to contact the above named bankrupt in order to notify him of his bankruptcy and to request that he lodge his Statement of Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I have sent certified letters to the last known addresses, being 33 Manning Street, Double Bay, New South Wales and 33 St Martins Lane, South Yarra, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">However, the letters were returned to my office unclaimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 

 
 
 I have also forwarded the notification of bankruptcy letter to 66 Abbotsford Street, Abbotsford, which is the address of the bankrupt's parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The letter has not been returned to my office..." 
 

It seems strange that the letter addressed to Mr Lelleton at 33 St Martins Lane, South Yarra was returned unclaimed, given that Mr Lelleton had received it and responded to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It may be that it was the letter addressed to 66 Abbotsford Street, Abbotsford which was returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr White subsequently filed an affidavit in the earlier proceeding, VB 737/95, deposing that he had not been able to contact Mr Lelleton and that he had no details of Mr Lelleton's estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">There is no record of the Statement of Affairs being received by the Registrar in Bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In these circumstances Mr Lelleton applies to the Court for declarations that his Statement of Affairs be deemed to have been filed on 19 April 1995 and that he was discharged from bankruptcy on 19 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr White has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and advised that he neither objects nor consents to the orders sought by Mr Lelleton being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">At relevant times s 54(1) of the Act provided that: 
 
 "54(1) Where a sequestration order is made, the person against whose estate it is made shall, within 14 days from the day on which he is notified of the bankruptcy: 
 

 
 
 (a) make out and file in the office of the Registrar for the District in which the sequestration order was made a statement of his affairs; and
 (b) furnish a copy of the statement to the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">" 
 
 The first issue which thus arises for determination is whether or not Mr Lelleton complied with the obligation imposed on him by s 54(1)(a) to "file" the statement of his affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In Sofia and Anor v Pattison and Anor , [1997] VG 7619 (Unreported, Finkelstein J, 20 October 1997), his Honour said: 
 
 "Whether the word "file" in s 54(1) is intended to be a reference to the act of the bankrupt or the act of the Registrar is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">But, having regard to the context in which the word is used it should be regarded as a reference to the act of the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In the first place, the obligation that is imposed by s 54(1) is an obligation that is imposed on the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the second place the obligation is to file a document at a particular place namely at a Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This suggests that the statement will be filed when it is left with an officer at the Registry rather than when it has been placed on a file that is maintained at the Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Thus the section will be complied with whether or not the statement is subsequently placed on a file by the officer who received it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">" 
 

This decision provides some assistance to Mr Lelleton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It is authority for the proposition that it cannot be concluded that a statement has not been filed for the purposes of s 54(1) simply because the document does not appear on a file maintained by the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Lelleton did not, however, hand deliver his Statement to the Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">He posted it and is unable to explain why it does not appear on file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There are a number of possibilities, the most obvious ones being that it went astray in the mail or, having been delivered to the Registry it was, for some unknown reason, not placed on file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Mr Lelleton nonetheless contends that he satisfied the requirements of s 54(1)(a) of the Act by posting the Statement of Affairs to the Registrar in Bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He relied on the decision of Kenny J in Trihakis v Official Receiver (Vic) [1999] FCA 1426.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Her Honour there held that a Statement of Affairs could be filed by posting a completed original statement to the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In that case a declaration of the kind presently sought was granted in circumstances in which her Honour was satisfied that a Statement of Affairs had been posted but, for some undisclosed reason, could not be found on the Registrar's file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Lelleton posted his Statement of Affairs to the Registrar as he claims, on or about 19 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I am so satisfied for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Mr Lelleton has sworn that he posted the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">He retained a copy of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The copied form appears in a format that was in use in 1995 but is not presently in use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is dated April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It is inherently unlikely that Mr Lelleton would have attempted to reconstruct such a form so long after the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is also inherently unlikely that, having gone to the trouble of completing a long form in a timely way, he would not have attempted to comply with the obligation which Mr White had brought to his attention by posting it from Sydney to the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">At all relevant times s 149(4) of the Act provided: 
 
 "(4) If the bankrupt becomes a bankrupt after the commencement of s 27 of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 , the bankrupt is discharged at the end of the period of 3 years from the date on which the bankrupt filed his or her statement of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 

It is to be noted that the three year period runs from the date on which the Statement of Affairs was filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It does not run from the date on which the Trustee is provided with a copy of the Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Mr Lelleton's failure to provide a copy of the Statement to Mr White in 1995 can, therefore, have no bearing on the determination of the date of his discharge from bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The relevant date is the date of filing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In Trihakis , Kenny J fixed the date of filing as a day that was three days after the Statement of Affairs was signed in order to allow for any delay in posting and delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Given that the Statement in the present proceeding was despatched from Sydney on 19 April 1995, I consider that an allowance of two business days should be made such that the date of filing should be fixed, not as 19 April 1995 (the date of signing) but 21 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Discharge, by operation of s 149(4) of the Act would, therefore, have occurred on 21 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I note that Mr White's letter to Mr Lelleton is dated 7 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">If an equivalent allowance of two days is made for it to have been received by Mr Lelleton, his Statement of Affairs was filed, as required by s 54(1)(a) of the Act, within 14 days from the date on which he was notified of his bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Declarations, consistent with these findings, will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Associate:
 
 
Dated: 12 October 2009
 
 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr L Watts 
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: Mr R Silverstein 
 Date of Hearing: 12 October 2009 
 
 Date of Judgment: 12 October 2009
