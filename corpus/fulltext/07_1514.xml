 JUDGE: BUCHANAN J DATE: 28 SEPTEMBER 2007 PLACE: SYDNEY 


 SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 
 BUCHANAN J: 
 
1 In a judgment published on 4 July 2007 ( Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 1001) I provided reasons for making orders which the parties had agreed were appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2 Unfortunately, the orders as formally published contain a clerical error and are incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">As a result, they do not faithfully reflect the orders which the parties, by consent, asked the Court to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It has also become apparent that there is a clerical error in the orders proposed by the parties which was not detected by them or by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 In the circumstances, and for both reasons, it is appropriate to invoke the 'slip rule' and republish the orders in the form it was intended by the parties and the Court they should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 The republished orders will take effect from the date of the earlier judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.</sentence>
