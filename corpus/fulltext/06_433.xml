 Introduction 
 
1 The Westpoint Group of Companies (Westpoint Group) has, for some years, been engaged in the business of property development and raising finance for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its sources of funds have included banks and institutions and smaller retail investors in a form of finance known as mezzanine finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">A large number of such investors has paid a very large amount of money to Mezzanine Companies set up within the Group for the specific purpose of raising capital for particular projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Westpoint Group is now in a state of collapse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Many of the companies making it up are under external administration of one kind or another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) commenced an investigation into the affairs of the Group in mid 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Its investigations have uncovered evidence suggestive of widespread and serious misconduct in the conduct of the affairs of the Group up until quite recently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">As a result the position of investors and other creditors may be significantly prejudiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 ASIC commenced proceedings in this Court on 29 March 2006 seeking the appointment of receivers to the property of certain officers and former officers of companies in the Group and against four named corporate defendants which are members of the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The application was brought under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Interim freezing orders affecting the property of the various defendants were made by Siopis J on 5 April 2006 and extended until today when the substantive application, which was heard on 12 April 2006, falls to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The evidence placed before the Court in support of the application was extensive and detailed and was not the subject of any substantial challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is indicative of serious misconduct in the affairs of the companies and the very real possibility that there have been a number of contraventions of the Corporations Act and other laws by persons involved in the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Indeed there are aspects of the evidence suggestive of a ruthless disregard by the Westpoint Group's controllers of the interests of investors and other creditors in the way in which funds invested and assets of companies within the Group have been dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Other aspects of the evidence, particularly emerging from examination of the former directors of the Mezzanine Companies, are indicative of a degree of carelessness and indifference on their part to their duties as directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 It is not a necessary part of the Court's function at this stage to make a finding of any particular contravention or liability on the part of any person or company named as a defendant to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is sufficient to say, for the reasons that follow, that I regard it as necessary and desirable, to protect the interests of investors and creditors of companies in the Group, that receivers be appointed to the property of each of the defendants, other than seventh defendant which already has receivers and managers appointed under an existing security, and that ancillary orders be made in aid of those primary orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">A freezing order will be made in relation to the seventh defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Investigative and procedural background 
 
6 On 3 June 2005, 6 September 2005 and 11 October 2005 and on 7, 8 and 17 February 2006, ASIC made determinations, pursuant to subs 13(1) and 13(6) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) to investigate suspected contraventions of the Corporations Act , the ASIC Act and the Criminal Code of Western Australia by a number of companies and individuals associated with the Westpoint Property and Finance Group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The investigations covered the period from 1 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 The corporate entities in respect of which the determination were made fell into three groups referred to as 'the Companies', 'the Mezzanine Companies' and 'the Wider Westpoint Group'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">A complete list of the entities and persons the subject of the determinations is set out in Schedule A to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 The Westpoint Property and Finance Group has until recently undertaken property development including the construction of apartment blocks in various parts of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It raised finance for its undertakings from banks and other institutions subject to first ranking securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It also raised, through so called 'Mezzanine Companies', finance from individual investors who were issued with promissory notes or debentures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">To the extent that these investments were supported by securities held by companies in the Group, the securities ranked after those held by lending institutions, hence the reference to Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 Certain individuals have been closely associated with the activities of the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Norman Carey was its principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He was the sole director and shareholder of the Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (Westpoint Corporation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He was also a director or sole director of many of the other companies in the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">He was directly or indirectly the owner of many of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The evidence suggests that he was effectively their controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Graeme John Rundle was the Chief Financial Officer of the Group and the secretary of many of the companies in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Cedric Richard Palmer Beck and John Norman Dixon were directors of the Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Another former director, Ms Lynette Rochelle Schiftan, resigned in October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 The determination made by ASIC on 3 June 2005 was to conduct an investigation in relation to suspected contraventions by the directors of the Companies and the Mezzanine Companies of ss 184 and 588G of the Corporations Act , s 12DA of the ASIC Act and ss 373 and 409 of the Criminal Code (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Each of the determinations related to investigations into contraventions of those provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The later determinations widened the companies under investigation to cover the members of the Wider Westpoint Group as defined in the determination and additional members of the other groups of companies defined in the determinations as well as individual officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">11 In aid of its investigations ASIC conducted examinations of a number of persons under s 19 of the ASIC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">They were as follows: 
 
The second defendant, Graeme John Rundle, on 6 July 2005 and on 27 October 2005
The first defendant, Norman Phillip Carey, on 13 July 2005
The third defendant, Cedric Richard Palmer Beck, on 12 July 2005 and on 26 October 2005
Lynette Rochelle Schiftan on 23 August 2005
The fourth defendant, John Norman Dixon, on 24 August 2005 and 26 October 2005
Christopher Ezelym Fairman on 17 November 2005

At the commencement of each examination the ASIC officer conducting it directed the examinee not to disclose the questions asked or answers given in the course of the examination nor any information or documents provided to or by the examinee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The direction was said to remain in force until 31 December 2006 or further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">12 Many documents were produced to ASIC in the course of its investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">These included: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Information Memoranda issued to prospective investors in various of the Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">A product disclosure statement entitled Westpoint Income Fund Product Disclosure Statement issued 19 November 2003.</sentence>

<sentence id="s62">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Books and records in the possession of the defendants Carey, Rundle, Beck and Dixon and one Gregory John Nairn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">


ASIC also undertook searches of property registered in the names of the various defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">13 The investigations so far have placed in ASIC's hands a very large number of documents, substantial transcripts of the examinations of individuals associated with the Westpoint Group and reports from receivers and managers appointed to companies within the Group and from the liquidator of Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">14 On 29 March 2006 ASIC filed an application in this Court seeking orders under s 1323 of the Corporations Act against four officers and former officers of companies associated with the Westpoint Property and Finance Group and against four associated companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The orders sought are for the appointment of receivers and managers of the property of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Associated asset preservation orders and orders requiring disclosure on affidavit of the assets of the defendants as well as orders requiring surrender of the individual's passports were also sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">15 On 30 March 2006 Siopis J made interim orders restraining the defendants from removing any of their property from Australia or from otherwise dealing with it except to the extent set out in the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He also directed the surrender of their passports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">His Honour published his reasons for those orders on 5 April 2006 --- Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey [2006] FCA 366.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">16 On 7 April 2006 I made orders extending the operation of the interim injunctions granted by Siopis J (subject to some undisputed variations) until 5pm on 12 April 2006 which was the date set down for the hearing of the substantive application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Following the hearing of the substantive application those orders were further extended to 5pm on Thursday 20 April 2006 subject to further agreed variations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Judgment on the substantive application was reserved to 2.15pm on Thursday 20 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">17 There was an application made on behalf of the second defendant for an order setting aside the ex parte orders made by Siopis J on the basis that there had not been full disclosure by ASIC of relevant evidence to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The second defendant submitted that ASIC's evidence predominately related to transactions involving other defendants which were not relevant to the second.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I am not satisfied that any material non disclosure is shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In any event the interim freezing orders lapse today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The relief claimed 
 
18 In its originating process ASIC claims orders for the appointment of receivers in the following terms: 
 
 ' B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Receiver orders: 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">An order, pursuant to section 1323(1)(h) of the Corporations Act , that until further order, Oren Zohar, Brian McMaster and Mark Korda of KordaMentha, chartered accountants, of Level 11, 37 St George's Terrace, Perth, be appointed as receivers and managers (" the Receivers ") without security, to all property (" the Property "), whether within Australia or overseas, of each of the Defendants.</sentence>

<sentence id="s83">An order that the Receivers have, in respect of the Property, the following powers: 
 
 
 
 
 
 7.1 the power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with, or as incidental to, the collecting and securing of all of the Property for the benefit of potential creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 7.2 without limiting the generality of subparagraph 7.1, the power to:

19 ASIC also seeks Mareva type orders for the preservation of the defendants' assets, affidavits of their assets and an order requiring the surrender, by the first to fourth defendants, of their passports and restraining them from leaving Australia or coming within one kilometre of an Australian point of overseas departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">As has already been noted, asset preservation orders and passport orders have already been made by Siopis J on an interim basis and renewed from time to time with some agreed variations pending judgment on the substantive application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Following the hearing of the application ASIC submitted minutes of proposed orders in respect of each of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The statutory framework --- the Corporations Act 
 
20 Section 1323 of the Corporations Act provides, inter alia: 
 
 (1) Where: 
 
 
 
 (a) an investigation is being carried out under the ASIC Act or this Act in relation to an act or omission by a person, being an act or omission that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of this Act; or 
 (b) a prosecution has been begun against a person for a contravention of this Act; or 
 (c) a civil proceeding has been begun against a person under this Act; 
 
 
 
 and the Court considers it necessary or desirable to do so for the purpose of protecting the interests of a person (in this section called an aggrieved person ) to whom the person referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c), as the case may be, (in this section called the relevant person ), is liable, or may be or become liable, to pay money, whether in respect of a debt, by way of damages or compensation or otherwise, or to account for financial products or other property, the Court may, on application by ASIC or by an aggrieved person, make one or more of the following orders: 
 
 
 ... 
 (f) an order prohibiting the taking or sending out of this jurisdiction, or out of Australia, by a person of money of the relevant person or of an associate of the relevant person; 
 (g) an order prohibiting the taking, sending or transfer by a person of financial products or other property of the relevant person, or of an associate of the relevant person: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) from a place in this jurisdiction to a place outside this jurisdiction (including the transfer of financial products from a register in this jurisdiction to a register outside this jurisdiction); or 
 (ii) from a place in Australia to a place outside Australia (including the transfer of financial products from a register in Australia to a register outside Australia); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (h) an order appointing: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the relevant person is a natural person --- a receiver or trustee, having such powers as the Court orders, of the property or of part of the property of that person; or 
 (ii) if the relevant person is a body corporate --- a receiver or receiver and manager, having such powers as the Court orders, of the property or of part of the property of that person; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (j) if the relevant person is a natural person --- an order requiring that person to deliver up to the Court his or her passport and such other documents as the Court thinks fit; 
 (k) if the relevant person is a natural person --- an order prohibiting that person from leaving this jurisdiction, or Australia, without the consent of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">
 
 
 
 (2A) A reference in paragraph (1)(g) or (h) to property of a person includes a reference to property that the person holds otherwise than as sole beneficial owner, for example: 
 
 
 
 (a) as trustee for, as nominee for, or otherwise on behalf of or on account of, another person; or 
 (b) in a fiduciary capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 
 
 (2B) Subsection (2A) is to avoid doubt, is not to limit the generality of anything in subsection (1) and is not to affect by implication the interpretation of any other provision of this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">
 
 (2) An order under subsection (1) prohibiting conduct may prohibit the conduct either absolutely or subject to conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 
 (3) Where an application is made to the Court for an order under subsection (1), the Court may, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, before considering the application, grant an interim order, being an order of the kind applied for that is expressed to have effect pending the determination of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
 
 (4) On an application under subsection (1), the Court must not require the applicant or any other person, as a condition of granting an interim order under subsection (3), to give an undertaking as to damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 
 (5) Where the Court has made an order under this section on a person's application, the Court may, on application by that person or by any person affected by the order, make a further order discharging or varying the first-mentioned order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 
 (6) An order made under subsection (1) or (2) may be expressed to operate for a specified period or until the order is discharged by a further order under this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 
 (7) Nothing in this section affects the powers that the Court has apart from this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 (8) This section has effect subject to the Bankruptcy Act 1966.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">(9) A person must not contravene an order by the Court under this section that is applicable to the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 (10) An offence based on subsection (9) is an offence of strict liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">




 Principles governing the application of s 1323 
 
21 The application before the Court is brought under s 1323 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Preconditions for the making of an order under that section are satisfied when: 
 
 (a) An investigation is being carried out under the ASIC Act or the Corporations Act in relation to an act or omission that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">(b) There is an application made by ASIC or an aggrieved person for one or more of the orders that may be made under that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">

Those preconditions are satisfied in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">There is an investigation being carried out and the relevant application has been made by ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">22 Upon an application properly before it under s 1323, the Court can make the orders for which the section provides where: 
 
 (i) There is a relevant person who is or may become liable to pay money whether in respect of a debt, by way of damages or compensation or otherwise, or to account for financial products or other property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">(ii) The liability is to another person called 'the aggrieved person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">(iii) The court considers it necessary or desirable to make the orders 'for the purpose of protecting the interests of the aggrieved person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">

23 The liabilities, actual or potential, to which the section refers, may arise from a contravention of the Corporations Act or under the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The Court may have regard to known facts and circumstances in assessing their existence and potential existence --- Lone Star Exploration NL v Corporate Affairs Commission (1988) 6 ACLC 1108 at 1113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Von Doussa J said in that case: 
 
 '...the Court may have regard to all the known facts and circumstances, although in a particular case the Court may think it appropriate to consider whether the actual or potential liability is connected in some way with a particular contravention of the [Corporations Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">' 
 

24 There is a variety of ways in which the interests of persons, to whom liabilities may be owed, can be protected by orders made under the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The nature of the protection can vary according to the nature of the risks assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">As Palmer J said in ASIC v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1530 at [37]:
 
 '... there may be evidence to suggest that fraud has been perpetrated on a large scale and that many of the victims have no or little information about the extent of the fraud, no or little means for their own investigations, and no or little resources to prosecute their own claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In such a case, the interests of such persons are protected, within the contemplation of s 1323, by enabling ASIC to conduct an investigation for the purpose of identifying the wrongdoers and exposing them not only to penalties under the Corporations Act and other legislation, but also to claims for compensation from the victims themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">' 
 ` 

25 The orders that can be made under the section are directed, inter alia, to the preservation of assets against which recovery may be sought in the event that liability to an 'aggrieved person' is established on the part of a 'relevant person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The orders are made in circumstances where 'an investigation is being carried out', 'a prosecution has been begun' or 'a civil proceeding has been begun'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">That is to say the orders can be made before liability is established and indeed before the evidence necessary to establish liability has been collected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">While an application under the section is not interlocutory in an existing criminal or civil proceeding, it is interlocutory in a wider sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It preserves the status quo and the assets of the relevant person pending the outcome of the investigation, prosecution or civil proceedings which are on foot --- CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL( No 2) (1988) 14 ACLR 499 at 504.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">At the stage an order is sought the Court may not be in a position to identify with precision any particular liability owed by the person the subject of the proposed order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">This consideration applies to final orders made under the section as well as to interim orders for which it expressly provides in s 1323(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The final orders made under the section are necessarily of a temporary or holding character rather than finally disposing of the rights and liabilities of the relevant persons affected by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">26 The circumstances in which the Court may make orders under s 1323(1) are wide as indicated by the words 'necessary or desirable ... for the purpose of protecting the interests of a person ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">There is an element of risk assessment and risk management in the judgment the Court is called on to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It follows, and has been accepted, that there is no requirement on the part of ASIC to demonstrate a prima facie case of liability on the part of the relevant person or that the person's assets have been or are about to be dissipated --- Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1989) 7 ACLC 467 at 476 (Powell J); Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Adler (2001) 38 ACSR 266 at [7] (Santow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">27 The nature and duration of orders made under s 1323(1) can be fashioned by the Court to reflect its assessment of any risk of dissipation of the assets of a person under investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">But their legitimate purposes can go further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The interests of aggrieved persons may be protected not only by orders designed to protect dissipation of assets, but also by orders which create an opportunity for the assets of the person under investigation to be ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">28 The appointment of a receiver may offer a more flexible response to the exigencies of the case presented to the Court than the imposition or continuation of a freezing order albeit they are not mutually exclusive remedies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The receiver can be equipped with the powers necessary to enable him or her to identify and locate a relevant person's assets and to prevent their dissipation or removal from the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The receiver can also ensure, without the necessity of specific applications to the Court to vary freezing orders, that bona fide dealings with assets which do not diminish the overall estate of the person under investigation and which allow that person to attend to their legitimate business affairs can be permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">While ASIC has investigative powers which can be used to like effect, they do not necessarily give the capacity for short term responses and flexibility of action that a competent receiver armed with suitable powers may have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">29 It is not a necessary consequence of an order appointing a receiver that the receiver should deal with or liquidate the assets in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The interlocutory and protective character of orders made under s 1323 must be borne in mind when defining the powers of the receiver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The appointment of a receiver has rightly been described as 'an extraordinary step' --- ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694 at [8] (Austin J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">However depending upon the nature of the powers conferred on the receiver it may be less drastic than a freezing order which can only be varied by order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The interlocutory history of this case has already demonstrated that circumstances not contemplated when the original interim freezing orders were made have required their variation from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I accept, with respect, the observation made by Austin J in Burke at [8]:
 
 'Without wishing to lay down any general rules, it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified, even though Mareva Orders are in place, in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments, and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims, and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Where these circumstances exist in combination, and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved, the Court may conclude ...that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected, and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 

The decision was cited with approval by Santow J in ASIC v Adler (supra) at 268-269.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The evidence that may be relied upon 
 
30 Section 1323 does not make any express provision for the nature of the evidence on which the Court may act in making orders under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Applications made under the section have an interlocutory character albeit there are no other specific proceedings to which they may relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The section does not require concluded findings of fact about liability or whether assets have been dissipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">For the reasons already canvassed the Court, in making orders under s 1323 , engages in a risk assessment and management process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The logic of the section assumes that the Court will not always have before it evidence of the kind that would be necessary and admissible in proceedings to establish definitively the nature and extent of the assets of the persons under investigation and their liability to aggrieved persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Nor will it necessarily have before it evidence of the kind that would establish definitively that dissipation of assets has occurred or is likely to occur or that flight is imminent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">31 The logic of s 1323 requires the Court to be able to act on evidence which might not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings leading to a definitive determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Hearsay evidence may therefore be received and acted upon, not as proof of the truth of its content but as evidence of the existence of a risk or possibility that gives rise to the necessity for or desirability of a protective order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It is not necessary, in this context, to consider whether the proceedings are interlocutory for the purposes of the exception to the hearsay rule under s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) albeit that that exception is no doubt informed by similar considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Evidence may be received of the opinion of a suitably qualified person who has had the opportunity to review extensive documentation collected in the course of an investigation and to offer an overview of it for the benefit of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">In such a case the opinion or overview should be supported by reference to the relevant documentation and factual material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The opinion is received not for the determination of any ultimate issue of liability but as probative of the risk which the Court must assess in determining whether to make an order under the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">These considerations are relevant to the admissibility of some of the affidavit evidence which has been relied upon in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">32 Specific objection has been taken on behalf of the second defendant to the use of transcripts of examinations conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It was submitted that pursuant to s 68(3) of the ASIC Act such transcripts are not admissible in evidence against the person who has signed the record in a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It was submitted that the present proceedings are, in truth, proceedings for the imposition of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">This is on the basis that if interlocutory in nature, then they are interlocutory in respect of proceedings not yet commenced but which will inevitably be penalty proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">33 Accepting that there is a possibility that penalty proceedings may be taken against one or more of the defendants in this case that does not, in my opinion, render the present application an application for the imposition of a penalty or an application incidental to such proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">As already noted, evidence may be relied upon of a hearsay or opinion character in these proceedings which might not be admissible in penalty proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The same is true for s 19 transcripts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">34 It was submitted for the second defendant that because ASIC seeks an order that the reasonable costs of the receivers and managers whose appointment it seeks should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants, that fact itself gives the present application the character of a penalty proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In my opinion however, the submission is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">An order for the payment of costs out of the collective assets of the defendants would not of itself amount to the imposition of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Although it may effectively deprive defendants of some of their property that imposition is not by way of punishment for any contravention of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">35 Objection was also taken to the admissibility against the second defendant of transcripts of examinations of other parties conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In this respect s 77 of the ASIC Act was relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">That section provides: 
 
 'Where direct evidence by a person (the absent witness ) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding, a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter: 
 
 (a) if it appears to the court or tribunal that: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or 
 (ii) the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or 
 (iii) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal --- unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">' 
 
 

It was submitted for the second defendant that ASIC has not adduced evidence in respect of the matters set out in s 77(a) and that therefore the s 19 transcripts of those parties that are not parties to the proceeding may only be tendered if the conditions set out in par (a) are set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Counsel for ASIC on the other hand submitted that the second defendant had not required ASIC to call any absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and that therefore the condition of admissibility under s 77(b) of the Act was satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Given the urgency with which the application has been made, it is perhaps a little unrealistic to require advance notice by the second defendant of the requirement that any absent witness whose s 19 transcript is relied upon be called as a witness in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In my opinion, however, the transcripts of the examinations conducted under s 19 can be relied upon as tending to establish the possibility that circumstances exist which give rise to the necessity or desirability of a protective order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">What is in evidence here is the fact that the statement was made in the course of a s 19 examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The fact that the statement was made, rather like the hearsay evidence referred to earlier, may support an inference that circumstances exist that make a protective order necessary or desirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">It is not necessary to rely upon such evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">36 For these reasons I reject the objections to the use of the s 19 transcript evidence which were raised on behalf of the second defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">37 Objections to the admissibility of other affidavit evidence were made on the basis that it involved statements of the deponent's belief about the purpose of transactions and argumentative opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">So far as argumentative statements are concerned which are not able to be regarded as expert opinion or are unsupported by reference to factual material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I will disregard them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">However, descriptions in the nature of syntheses or summaries, based on examination of the documentary and transcript evidence dealing with the operations of the Westpoint Property and Finance Group, its cashflows and specific transactions, will be received on the basis that they go to the existence of circumstances upon which the Court may determine that it is necessary or desirable to make orders of the kind sought in this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The evidence before the Court 
 
38 The following affidavits were read in evidence:

<sentence id="s211">In this affidavit Mr Gomm, who is an investigator in the Enforcement Directorate at ASIC's Western Australian regional office, describes the processes by which ASIC sought and obtained a large quantity of documents relating to the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Based on a review of the documents produced to ASIC in compliance with its various notices and directions as well as a review of ASIC's own records, he expresses the opinion that the description in Oren Zohar's affidavit accords with ASIC's views in relation to the structure and composition of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">I take this to be a reference to his own views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He describes the way in which the financing of each of the property developments undertaken by the Westpoint Group was effected with funds provided by retail mezzanine investors.</sentence>

<sentence id="s223">He describes what he calls 'round robin transactions' and the results of various accounting entries made and cheques drawn on companies in the Group.</sentence>

 The structure and operation of the Westpoint Group 
 
39 The structure and general operation of the Westpoint Group was described in the affidavit of Oren Zohar sworn 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Mr Zohar has been a Chartered Accountant since 1995 and a Registered Liquidator since November 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">He has been an Official Liquidator since August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He has also been a Registered Trustee in Bankruptcy since February 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He has approximately 14 years experience as a corporate recovery specialist in all types of corporate and personal insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He has acted as a voluntary administrator, receiver or liquidator of over 280 companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">I accept that he is appropriately qualified to identify and describe group corporate structures and operations based on an examination of public and company records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He is also qualified, in my opinion, to identify from company records financial transactions which may constitute or be indicative of contraventions of the Corporations Act or possible breaches of duty by directors or officers of the corporations worthy of further investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">40 Mr Zohar exhibited to his affidavit of 29 March 2006 a schedule of companies within the Westpoint Group including details of their current directors and shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">He also exhibited a Schedule of Controlled Entities being companies within the Westpoint Group which were subject to some form of external administration at the time of swearing his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The latter list of companies, as updated in the supplementary affidavit of 6 April 2006, is set out in Schedule B to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">41 Mr Zohar's affidavit exhibited a colour-coded Corporate Structure of the Westpoint Group also updated in his supplementary affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">It comprises approximately 157 corporate and trust entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Thirty are under some form of external administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Eleven are 'Mezzanine Companies', nine of which are under administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Renaissance Mezzanine Pty Ltd (Renaissance Mezzanine) and Cinema City Mezzanine Pty Ltd (Cinema City Mezzanine) are not currently under the control of any external insolvency administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Mr Zohar's evidence, based on a search of the relevant company records, was that Mr Norman Carey, the first defendant, either directly or indirectly controls the four corporate defendants in the present proceedings, Richstar Enterprises, Westpoint Realty, Bowesco and Redchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Bowesco, as noted earlier, has had a Receiver and Manager appointed to it on 3 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">It is not in dispute on the material before the Court that the primary company within the Westpoint Group was Westpoint Corporation which is now in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Mr Norman Carey was its sole director and shareholder and Mr Graeme Rundle its secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The company was placed into administration on 24 January 2006 and a winding up order made on 16 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">42 Based on his examination of the Group records, Mr Zohar described Westpoint Corporation as a service provider to the majority of the members of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">It provided staff, premises, a treasury function, accounting services, information technology services and management services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The registered office and primary place of business for most of the Group members, including each of the corporate defendants, is Level 9, 160 St George's Terrace, Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The receivers of Westpoint Corporation, including Mr Zohar, remain in possession of those offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">43 Major projects undertaken by the Group were generally undertaken by special purpose development companies and funded by a combination of initial loans provided by Westpoint Corporation and funds provided by Mezzanine Companies or by a third party lender who would take security over the development company's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">In order to understand the operations of the Group Mr Zohar spoke with a number of people including: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Ray Ellis, former head of treasury for Westpoint Corporation who continued to work for the corporation on behalf of the receivers until 7 February 2006 and now works for Redchime Pty Ltd with Mr Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Brian Letts, the General Manager of Westpoint Realty, who continues to be employed by Westpoint Corporation to assist the receivers in realising and managing secured properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Brian O'Keefe, the General Manager of Finance at Westpoint Corporation who continued to work for the Corporation on behalf of the receivers until 15 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Miss Tracey Fox, a chartered accountant employed by Westpoint Corporation who continues to be employed by it in order to assist the receivers in maintaining and understanding the books and records of the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">

44 Based upon his discussions with staff at the Westpoint Corporation and his own investigations, Mr Zohar set out his general understanding of the operation of each of the Westpoint Group projects thus: 
 
(a) Westpoint Corporation would: 
 
 
 (i) provide initial funding to enable a development company to undertake preliminary work; 
 (ii) act as a central treasury, whereby it would lend money to Westpoint Group entities, and through the Westpoint Corporation central bank account pay the majority of the expenses of the Westpoint Group entities; 
 (iii) from time to time transfer money between Westpoint Group entities as required to fund any particular project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Westpoint Corporation would keep the records of the loan accounts between those entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 
 (b) Westpoint Finance Pty Ltd (Westpoint Finance) would act as a licensed finance broker and earn commission revenue by finding prospective purchasers of properties the subject of the development, refer them to Westpoint Realty to sign up an agreement if they wished to proceed, and provide finance if required for the purchase of the property;
 (c) generally Westpoint Constructions Pty Ltd (Westpoint Construction) would undertake the construction of the development and was entitled to pre-invoice at least 65% of the contract price in advance for any project; 
 (d) Westpoint Realty would act as the licensed real estate agent earning revenue from the sale and leasing of properties mainly on behalf of purchasers referred by Westpoint Finance and other Westpoint Group entities and third party owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">

45 Mr Zohar described his understanding of the flow of funds in the Westpoint Group corporations based upon his discussions with Westpoint Corporation staff and his own investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">This was as follows: 
 
 (a) Investors would provide funds to a Mezzanine Company which would be banked into an account held by that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">(b) Funds would be transferred as required by Westpoint Corporation from the Mezzanine Company to Westpoint Corporation's account and be recorded as a loan by the Mezzanine Company to the Development Company and then a loan from the Development Company to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">(c) Westpoint Corporation would pay the majority of the expenses of any development and record those expenses against the development company loan account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">These would include payments to Westpoint Realty and to Westpoint Construction to complete the development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">It would also cover administrative and overhead expenses not necessarily related to the specific project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">(d) Westpoint Corporation would pay money to the Mezzanine Company by way of monthly interest and would also pay commissions to financial planners who procured investments from members of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">These would be reflected in a loan account between the Development Company and Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">As between the Development Company and the Mezzanine Company, the Development Company would record the cost as work in progress and the Mezzanine Company would record the transaction as revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">(e) As properties were sold the funds received on settlement would be paid to clear secured debts and pay commissions and selling expenses but any excess funds would be paid to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">

46 Mr Zohar's affidavit exhibited a report as to the affairs of Westpoint Corporation submitted to ASIC and dated 23 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It was signed by Messrs Carey, Rundle and Nairn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">In the report 35 intercompany loans were identified as owing to Westpoint Corporation, totalling $148,761,510.09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Only $23,770,731.26 was estimated to be realisable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">A further 20 related party loan accounts were disclosed under which Westpoint Corporation owed a total of $71,176,415.26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">From his review of the Westpoint Corporation records, Mr Zohar found 62 related party loans which he had identified during the course of the receivership to and from Westpoint Corporation as requiring further investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">These included 38 loans owing from related entities totalling $143,766,703.33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Only $22,389,786.64 was estimated by Mr Carey as realisable in the report as to affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There were 25 loans owing to related entities totalling $75,029,895.59 of which Mr Carey admitted $71,176,415.26 in the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">47 Mr Zohar stated that no meaningful reconciliation could be undertaken in relation to the recoverability of related party loans until a full investigation could be carried out in relation to each of the entities within the Westpoint Group given the level of intercompany indebtedness and intercompany debt assignments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">48 In Mr Gomm's first affidavit he referred to Mr Zohar's affidavit and in particular his descriptions of the Westpoint Group and what he called the 'Central Role of Westpoint Corporation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Mr Gomm said, that based on a review of the documents produced to ASIC under various notices and directions which it issued as well as a review of ASIC's records, he agreed with Mr Zohar's description of the structure and composition of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">He gave an account in his affidavit of the structure of the Mezzanine Companies and the way in which they operated to raise funds for Westpoint Group projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">49 Mr Gomm said that the funding for each of the property developments undertaken by the Westpoint Group when using funds provided by retail mezzanine investors, derived from three sources: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Initial equity from within the Westpoint Group to provide funding for land acquisition and preliminary expenses such as development approvals --- this equity was recouped when sufficient funds were raised from mezzanine investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Debt financing from special purpose Mezzanine Companies incorporated to raise funds from retail investors by the issue of promissory notes or debentures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Senior financing from a bank or other financial institution granted a first ranking security over the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">This financing became available to be drawn down during the construction phase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">In some cases, and in particular the Emu Brewery and Ann Street projects, senior financing was also obtained to assist in the purchase of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">

50 The Mezzanine Companies had issued Information Memoranda for the offer of promissory notes to retail clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The purpose of the raising of the funds was said to be the development of specific projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Mr Gomm exhibited copies of the Information Memoranda produced to ASIC in the course of its investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">By way of example, the first of those Information Memoranda exhibited to his affidavit related to a $25 million promissory note issue by Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd (Bayshore Mezzanine).</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">This referred to a 292 apartment complex to be located at 45 Bay Street in Melbourne, directly opposite another Westpoint development known as the Bayview Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The Memorandum disclosed that the total funding required for the project was $105 million arranged as follows: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Bank debt - $70 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Mezzanine finance the subject of the Memorandum - $25 million
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Project equity - $10 million

The end project value was said to be $140 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Under the heading 'The Promissory Note Offer' it was stated: 
 
 
 'Bayshore Mezzanine is seeking to raise $25 million by the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">It will then lend this amount to the Trust to assist in funding the project on the terms and conditions set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">' 
 

Each promissory note was required to have a minimum face value of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">The Information Memoranda stated that Promissory Notes by nature are unsecured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">It went on: 
 
 
 'However, to mitigate the lending risk, Bayshore Mezzanine, the issuer of the Promissory Notes and a single purpose company, will have security over the project as noted in the financing structure below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">' 
 

A diagram followed which showed the development being carried on through the Bayshore Port Melbourne Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The financier, namely a bank, would hold a first ranking mortgage over the property and a first ranking charge over the Trust, ie the assets of the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Bayshore Mezzanine would have a second ranking fixed and floating charge over the Trust and a second ranking mortgage over the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Westpoint Corporation and associated entities would provide a guarantee for Bayshore Mezzanine up until the redemption of all promissory notes and satisfaction of all interest payments due under those promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The Information Memorandum went on to say that the Westpoint Group would act as development manager of the project and its construction company would act as the senior contractor for the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The Information Memorandum promised prudent financial management by the Westpoint Group, which would carefully control costs and measure profit impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Risk would be minimised and managed by the Westpoint Group through the stringent application of a range of mechanisms which were set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">A number of risk factors were also identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Questionable transactions in the Westpoint Group 
 
51 Mr Gomm said, in his affidavit, that a review of documents in ASIC's possession showed that moneys raised by the Mezzanine Companies were recorded in the accounting records of the Westpoint Group as having been lent to special purpose Development Companies incorporated for the purpose of undertaking that specific project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">He exhibited to his affidavit copies of loan agreements entered into between the Mezzanine Companies and the Development Companies for a number of projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The Mezzanine Companies would obtain a secondary security over the projects in exchange for the loans to the Development Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The moneys raised by the Mezzanine Companies were also guaranteed by entities related to the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Each Development Company entered into a Lump Sum Design and Construction Contract with Westpoint Constructions for the construction of a specific project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Under a special condition inserted in some of the construction contracts, Westpoint Constructions was permitted to pre-invoice the Development Company an amount equal to or less than 65% of the value of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">52 Mr Gomm described the actual flow of funds raised by Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Application moneys received from investors were banked into the respective Mezzanine Companies' bank accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">He exhibited to his affidavit copies of application forms, general ledger printouts and bank statements in relation to Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">From time to time, and sometimes daily, the money in Mezzanine Company bank accounts was paid directly to the bank account of Westpoint Corporation after deducting amounts for expenses such as commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The funds were paid to Westpoint Corporation acting as 'treasury' for the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">There was no segregation, in Westpoint Corporation's bank account, of funds received from the various Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Mr Gomm exhibited copies of supporting documents including invoices, cheque requisitions, remittance advices and bank statements which gave examples of payments made from Westpoint Corporation's bank account that did not appear to relate to specific projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">His conclusion was that once moneys were received by Westpoint Corporation from the Mezzanine Companies they were used to make payments that did not necessarily relate to the specific projects for which the funds had been raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">53 A matter of particular concern was the treatment of investor rollovers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Gomm deposed that investors were regularly 'rolled over' into other projects being undertaken by the Westpoint Group when their promissory notes or debentures expired or were approaching expiry dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Where investors were rolled over from one project to another they were issued with a new promissory note relating to the second project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">There was no corresponding payment of money however from entities involved with project A to entities involved with project B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The rollovers were simply accounted for by a series of journal entries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">As described by Mr Gomm, these journals reflected the following: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">A transfer of promissory note liability from Mezzanine Company A to Mezzanine Company B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">A decrease in the liability of Developer A to Mezzanine Company A and an increase in the amount owed by Developer A to Westpoint Corporation acting as group treasurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">This would reflect Westpoint Corporation initially assuming the liability to the investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Mezzanine Company B would record the liability to the investors as a result of them being rolled over from Mezzanine Company A and create a receivable from Developer B as if the rolled over amount had been lent to Developer B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Developer B recorded a receivable from Westpoint Corporation for the amount of the promissory notes rolled over and a loan owing to Mezzanine Company B as if the amount had been borrowed from Mezzanine Company B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Westpoint Corporation adjusted intercompany loan accounts by increasing the amount owing to Developer B and decreasing the amount owing to Developer A by the amount of the rollover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">

54 In his second affidavit, Mr Gomm deposed that, based upon his investigations in relation to the Westpoint Group, a number of transactions appeared to have been effected by entities within the Group at a time when it was reasonable to expect that Westpoint Corporation and other entities would shortly go into some form of external administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">These transactions were said to be funded by payments to Westpoint Corporation from various companies within the Group that had issued promissory notes and debentures to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The transactions were said to have had the effect of reducing the assets of the Westpoint Group available to meet the claims of third party creditors and of benefiting persons formerly in control of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">55 Mr Gomm's affidavit then went into detail about the transactions to which he was referring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He described first the passing of cash from Mezzanine Companies through Westpoint Corporation to ongoing operational entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">On 24 November 2005 Westpoint Corporation paid $1 million to Renaissance Mezzanine and $1,150,000 to Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">It paid $1,370,000 to Richstar Enterprises on 25 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">These three payments appear to have had the direct effect of reducing the cash assets available to the unsecured creditors of Westpoint Corporation by $3,520,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Cash was passed to entities undertaking the ongoing operations of persons formerly in control of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">That is said to have been done as follows: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Through on-payment of the $1 million received by Renaissance Mezzanine on 24 November 2005 to Rold Corporation Pty Ltd (Rold Corporation) on 25 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Through the passing of $1,150,000 of cash to Bowesco as trustee for the Dyson Family Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">By passing $1,370,000 of cash previously held by Westpoint Corporation to Richstar Enterprises as trustee for the Richstar Enterprises Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">

56 At the time that these transactions occurred ASIC had filed its application on 22 November 2005 for orders to wind up York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Voluntary administrators were appointed to that company on 23 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">York Street Mezzanine's liabilities are guaranteed by Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Monthly interest payments for the month of November 2005, which were due for payment at the end of that month, were not made by various of the Westpoint Group Mezzanine Companies to the holders of promissory notes and debentures that they had issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The three payments outlined above, according to Mr Gomm, appeared in large part to have been funded by payments to Westpoint Corporation from various of the Westpoint Group Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">57 Mr Gomm pointed to evidence indicating that the three payments referred to were funded from investor moneys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The opening balance of the Westpoint Corporation bank account on 21 November 2005 was $2,173,617.61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Immediately following its payment of $1,370,000 to the Richstar Enterprises Trust on 25 November, the balance of the bank account was $1,040,675.61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">He referred to records of money movements supporting the conclusion that from 21 November 2005 to 25 November 2005 deposits totalling $3,675,000 were made into the Westpoint Corporation bank account by various of the Westpoint Group Mezzanine Companies which had issued promissory notes and debentures to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The deposits were as follows: 
 
 (a) $700,000 deposited by Mount Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (now in liquidation) on 21 November 2005;
 (b) $1,100,000 deposited by Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd (now in liquidation) on 21 November 2005; 
 (c) $45,000 deposited by Bayview Heritage Mezzanine Pty Ltd (now in liquidation) on 24 November 2005; 
 (d) $95,000 deposited by Market Street Mezzanine No 2 Pty Ltd (now in liquidation) on 24 November 2005; 
 (e) $150,000 deposited by Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (now in liquidation) on 24 November 2005; 
 (f) $640,000 deposited by Mount Street Mezzanine on 24 November 2005; 
 (g) $945,000 deposited by Bayshore Mezzanine on 21 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">

58 Mr Gomm then referred to an ANZ bank statement for the period 18 November 2005 to 25 November 2005 for the Westpoint Corporation bank account which included these deposits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">In addition he exhibited to his affidavit memoranda from a Group Finance Manager, Chris Fairman, to the first defendant, Norman Carey, on 21 and 24 November 2005 requesting authorisation for loan advances to be made by the Mezzanine Companies referred to above together with emails from Raymond Ellis requesting that those amounts be transferred to 'Corp'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">ANZ bank statements for the relevant Mezzanine Companies at the time are also referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Mr Gomm noted that, of the deposits made into the Westpoint Corporation bank account between 21 November and 25 November 2005, only $381,187.37 came from bank accounts not operated by the Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">59 Mr Gomm described two sets of 'round robin' transactions of $1 million each entered into in January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Under the first of those transactions, on 5 January 2006, $1 million was paid by Bowesco as trustee of the Dyson Family Trust to the Westpoint Income Fund, a managed investment scheme registered under the Corporations Act with Westpoint Management Ltd. That amount was onpaid on the same day by the Westpoint Income Fund to Goldtag Pty Ltd as trustee for Cinema City Property Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">On 9 January 2006, $1 million was paid by the Cinema City Property Trust back to the Dyson Family Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">60 The second round robin transaction commenced on 13 January 2006 when another $1 million was paid by the Dyson Family Trust to the Westpoint Income Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">On 17 January 2006 $1 million was paid by the Westpoint Income Fund to the Cinema City Property Trust and on 18 January 2006 that sum was paid in two tranches of $500,000 each by the Cinema City Property Trust back to the Dyson Family Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">There was no net effect on the cash balances of any of the Dyson Family Trust, the Westpoint Income Fund or the Cinema City Property Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Mr Gomm exhibited copies of various documents including bank statements detailing these transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">61 Mr Gomm also referred to a two page document originating in the Westpoint Group setting out a number of accounting (journal) entries that were to be made in the accounting records of six entities being the Dyson Family Trust, the Westpoint Income Fund, the Cinema City Property Trust, Westpoint Corporation, Lanepoint Enterprises and Centreways Refurbishment Syndicate Trust (CRST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Lanepoint Enterprises is a development company whose principal asset is a development known as 'Regency Apartments'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Its sole director is Allan Carey, the brother of Norman Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Had all of the accounting entries set out in the journal listing been recorded in the accounting records of the six entities they would have had the net effect of: 
 
 (a) reducing the amount owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises by $2 million; 
 (b) converting $700,000 of an amount owing to CRST by Westpoint Corporation into an amount owing by the Dyson Family Trust to CRST; 
 (c) substituting $2 million of the amount owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises with a new loan in that amount to the Cinema City Property Trust; 
 (d) creating an amount of $2 million owing to the Cinema City Property Trust by Westpoint Corporation in respect of the $2 million received by the Cinema City Property Trust from the Westpoint Income Fund; 
 (e) Westpoint Corporation recognising $2,500,000 of income and the Cinema City Property Trust correspondingly incurring $2,500,000 of costs in respect of a development management fee invoice; 
 (f) creating an amount of $2,750,000 owing to Westpoint Corporation by the Cinema City Property Trust in respect of the development management fee invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">


Mr Gomm pointed out that the Cinema City Property Trust had not been indebted to the Westpoint Income Fund prior to the substitution of $2 million owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises with a loan from the Westpoint Income Fund to the Cinema City Property Trust in that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Following that substitution the $2 million owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by the Cinema City Property Trust represented 17.7% of the total assets of the Westpoint Income Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">62 Mr Gomm referred to withdrawals from the Dyson Family Trust bank account (Bowesco) following the second round robin transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">By 13 February 2006 the balance of that account had been reduced to $56,581.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Total withdrawals from the account during the period from 19 January 2006 to 13 March 2006 amounted to $1,225,353.65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">63 Mr Gomm expressed his belief that on 18 January 2006 the Dyson Family Trust paid $200,000 to Keypoint Developments Pty Ltd (Keypoint Developments) for the purpose of that company making payments to a number of its creditors as well as creditors of Lanepoint Enterprises and Keyworld Investments Pty Ltd (Keyworld Investments).</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">He referred to documentary evidence in support of that conclusion including various cheques drawn on the account of Keypoint Developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">64 Further cheques evidencing withdrawals from the Dyson Family Trust bank account were referred to in Mr Gomm's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">These cheques evidenced withdrawals from the account following the payment of the two tranches of $500,000 on 18 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">One of those cheques was for an amount of $350,000 for payment to Westpoint Constructions on behalf of Lanepoint Enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Another of the cheques, dated 8 February 2006, was for an amount of $10,000 paid to Redchime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">There was detailed reference to other transactions involving payments by Keypoint Developments, Keyworld Investments and transfers of amounts owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises to Kingdream Pty Ltd (Kingdream).</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">65 In the event, and as a result of revised draw down notices to which he referred in his evidence, and the first and second round robin transactions an amount owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises was reduced from $6,606,736.75 as at 30 November 2005 to $2,309,819.88 as at 31 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">That is a reduction of a debt which represented 48.2% of the total assets of the Westpoint Income Fund to a debt representing 20.5% of its total assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">66 Mr Zohar gave evidence in his affidavit of 29 March 2006 of what he described as 'irregular transactions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">These were transactions which, in his opinion, appeared to be designed to remove assets from Westpoint Corporation and some of its associated entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">67 Following his appointment as one of the Receivers and Managers to Westpoint Corporation, Mr Zohar instructed Tracey Fox to obtain books and records relating to assignments of loans between entities in the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">He was informed by Ms Fox that she had been instructed by Mr Carey and Mr Nairn between December 2005 and January 2006 to effect a series of assignments of loans between entities within the Westpoint Group in anticipation of the Westpoint Corporation being placed into voluntary administration in order to: 
 
 (a) remove debts owing to Westpoint Corporation and assigning the benefit of the debt to entities of which Mr Carey or his relatives retained control; and 
 (b) enhance the asset position of certain entities within the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">


Mr Zohar exhibited to his affidavit a copy of a spreadsheet identifying the relevant transactions which he designated 'Schedule of Assigned Loans'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The spreadsheet was prepared by one of his employees, Ms Price, based on information provided by Ms Fox and extracted from Westpoint Corporation's books and records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Mr Zohar also exhibited to his affidavit copies of: 
 
 
 (a) Deeds of Assignment and Notices of Assignments for most of the assignments identified in the Schedule of Assigned Loans; 
 (b) General ledger journal entries for each of the assignments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">


He described the effect of each of the transactions as follows: 
 
 
 (a) Entity A was a debtor of Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">In most instances it appeared to have had sufficient assets to repay the debt to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">(b) Entity B was a creditor of Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">(c) Westpoint Corporation purported to assign the debt owing by Entity A to Entity B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">(d) The purported consideration for the assignment was a reduction in the indebtedness of Westpoint Corporation to Entity B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">


In Mr Zohar's opinion the result of the transactions was that Westpoint Corporation had assigned what appeared to be valuable assets, by way of recoverable loans, to related entities and reduced the level of its unsecured indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Entity B had received the benefit of the assignment in consideration of the reduction of a debt owing to it by Westpoint Corporation that was essentially unrecoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">68 Mr Zohar set out the effect of each of these assignments in summary form based on the information provided to him by Ms Fox and the posting dates of each of the assignments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The dates of the majority of the Deeds of Assignment and journal entries were February, June and July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">However Ms Fox told Mr Zohar that she had been instructed by Greg Nairn of the Westpoint Group to post the transactions in December 2005 and January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">69 By way of example the first transaction in Mr Zohar's table was an assignment of a debt owing by Richstar Enterprises to Westpoint Corporation, the debt being assigned to Dosius Pty Ltd (Dosius).</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The assignment was said to arise from a deed dated 28 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Ms Fox informed Mr Zohar that Mr Nairn had instructed her to post the transaction on 3 December 2005 recording the journal date as the alleged date of the deed, namely 28 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">70 As a result of the assignments Westpoint Corporation appears to have reduced its assets by assigning debts to a total value of $11,063,142.12, although according to the records of Westpoint Corporation their value was only $10,699,766.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">71 According to Mr Zohar he was informed by Ms Fox that on or about 25 January 2006, the day after his appointment, she was instructed by Mr Nairn to process, in the Westpoint Group's books, a transfer to alter a debt owing by Westpoint Corporation to North Sydney Development Pty Ltd (North Sydney Development) in the sum of $6,570,026.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The debt was to be shown as owing by Westpoint Construction to North Sydney Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The stated reason for this transfer, according to Ms Fox, was that the debt was properly incurred by Westpoint Construction and not Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Mr Zohar, however, had been unable to verify this from his own investigation of the books and records in his possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">72 By a Contract of Sale dated 31 January 2002, Richstar Enterprises had purchased property, being Units 1 and 2 in 44 Wolseley Road, Point Piper in New South Wales, for $4,100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">At the time Mr Carey was the sole director of Richstar Enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">According to information received by Mr Zohar, the purchase was funded as follows:
 
 (a) HSBC Bank Australia Ltd provided a $3,720,000 loan to Richstar Enterprises with interest to be serviced on a monthly basis, with principal reductions of $45,000 to be paid quarterly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">(b) From time to time Westpoint Corporation would provide funds to service the loan payments so that as at 30 June 2004 $1,891,268 was owing by Richstar Enterprises to Westpoint Corporation as an interest free loan with no fixed term for repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">


A copy of the financial statements for Richstar Enterprises for the year ended 30 June 2004 showed the debt of $1,891,268 owing to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">73 Richstar Enterprises entered into a refinancing arrangement in early 2005 and was provided with a facility of $4,550,000 by Australian Unity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Of this amount $3,231,478 was used to repay the HSBC loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">$1,256,759 was paid into the Westpoint Corporation bank account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">A loan of that amount was then recorded in the Westpoint Corporation general ledger from Richstar Enterprises to Lanepoint Enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">74 Ms Fox informed Mr Zohar that although the funds were paid into the Westpoint Corporation bank account they were not directly advanced to Lanepoint Enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Although some of its development expenses were paid from time to time by Westpoint Corporation on behalf of the development company, the funds sitting in the accounts were used to pay general administrative and other expenses of Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">There is no written record of the receipt of $1,256,759 from Westpoint Corporation by Lanepoint Enterprises save for the posting of the journal entry and the recording of expenses to the general ledger of Lanepoint Enterprises of payments made by Westpoint Corporation on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">75 On 29 November 2005 it appears that Ms Fox was directed by Mr Ellis to process a general ledger journal entry to record repayment of the loan from Richstar Enterprises to Lanepoint Enterprises of $1,370,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The cash for that transaction came from a Westpoint Corporation Westpac account and was transferred to an account held by Richstar Enterprises with HSBC Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">76 On or about 7 February 2006 Mr Zohar was informed by Mr O'Keefe that the Point Piper property had been sold by Richstar Enterprises for $7.5 million and that settlement was expected to occur on 31 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Australian Unity was owed approximately $4.5 million and about $3 million would be available for subsequent creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">On or about 23 January 2006, however, Bowesco trading as the Dyson Family Trust, obtained a charge from Richstar Enterprises to secure alleged advances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">From Mr Zohar's examination of Richstar Enterprise's records at 31 January 2006, there was no liability from Richstar Enterprises to Bowesco and therefore no apparent reason for the granting of the Richstar Enterprise's charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Although Westpoint Corporation had serviced the loan repayments of the Point Piper property and had advanced funds of $2,114,966.46, Westpoint Corporation, as a result of the transactions referred to, would not receive any funds following the sale of the Point Piper property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">77 Other questionable transactions referred to by Mr Zohar in his affidavit included a series of intercompany loan transfers recorded in a document, located at Westpoint Corporation's offices, entitled 'The $2 million Run Around'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">This referred to payments made by Westpoint Corporation to Bowesco between 11 July 2005 and 15 December 2005 totalling $2,106,932.99 which, according to Mr Zohar, were said to represent loan repayments for funds allegedly advanced by Bowesco to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">It was Mr Zohar's evidence, by reference to the records which he examined, that Mr Carey, Mr Rundle and Mr Nairn had processed a series of transactions designed to leave debts in entities which had provided guarantees for the debts of the Mezzanine Companies and would therefore be unable to pay those debts or were not intended to continue to trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Debts owing from entitles of which they would retain control were removed to entities which might then become subject to external administration, such as Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">78 Mr Zohar described what he called 'the actual cash movement' in the series of transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">$2 million was paid by Bowesco to Goldtag and the same amount repaid by Goldtag to Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">The journal entries to support this cash transfer reflected a series of inter-entity transfers which he set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The end result was that Bowesco received back the initial $2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Before the $2 million run around, Lanepoint Enterprises was indebted to the Westpoint Income Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">At the end of the transactions it had reduced that indebtedness by $2 million and Goldtag had incurred a liability of $2 million to the Westpoint Income Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Lanepoint Enterprises held land assets which, after payment of secured debts, were expected to have a surplus value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Goldtag had provided guarantees for the Mezzanine Companies and had a potential liability far in excess of $200 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">There was no likelihood of Goldtag repaying the loan to the Westpoint Income Fund, whereas Lanepoint Enterprises would have had the capacity to repay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">79 Mr Zohar also referred to a liability for $530,975.88 owed by Lanepoint Enterprises to Renaissance Mezzanine, which was transferred to Vannin Pty Ltd as trustee for the Hay Family Trust (Vannin).</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">He instructed Ms Fox to examine the records of the Westpoint Group and provide him with a summary of the relevant transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">He exhibited a copy of a memorandum prepared by her summarising the transfers and attaching general ledger reports for the transfers which he then explained in summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The liability was transferred as follows: 
 
 (a) Renaissance Mezzanine lent $530,975.88 to Lanepoint Enterprises for the development of the Regency Apartment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">(b) On 29 December 2005 Mr Rundle and Mr Nairn instructed Ms Fox to transfer Lanepoint Enterprises's liability to Renaissance Mezzanine out of Lanepoint Enterprises to Vannin via Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">(c) As a result of the transaction Vannin was recorded as a debtor of Renaissance Mezzanine for $530,975.88; and 
 (d) Vannin granted security over a property at Hale Road to Renaissance Mezzanine to secure the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">

During the period 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005 funds totalling $1,667,000 appeared to have been transferred from Renaissance Mezzanine to Westpoint Corporation with $918,000 repaid during that period by Westpoint Corporation to Renaissance Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">The balance owing by Westpoint Corporation to Renaissance Mezzanine as at 31 December 2005 was $759,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">On 17 January 2006 under instructions from Mr Nairn and Mr Rundle, Ms Fox effected journal entries as a result of which the Westpoint Corporation liability was transferred to Vannin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Mr Zohar also found amongst documents lodged to be stamped at the State Revenue Department on 27 December 2005: 

 
 (a) A mortgage from Vannin to Renaissance Mezzanine to secure an alleged loan of $2,500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">(b) A deed of guarantee from Westpoint Corporation, Westpoint Consulting Group, Westpoint Realty, Forestview Nominees, Earlmist and Goldtag to Renaissance Mezzanine to secure an alleged loan of $2,500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">(c) A charge from Vannin to Renaissance Mezzanine to secure an alleged loan of $2,500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">


Mr Zohar pointed out that if the mortgage and charge were valid they would secure any surplus assets in Vannin after repayment of Perpetual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Those assets would include surplus equity expected to be received by Vannin upon the sale of a Hale Road property which would either be payable to creditors of Vannin in general, or given that Vannin had provided a guarantee for the debts due by the Mezzanine Companies, available to be applied to that debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">80 Further security documents were found by Mr Zohar at the State Revenue Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">These were allegedly executed on 23 January 2006, the day before the appointment of the administrators and receivers to Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">They were lodged to be stamped on 25 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">They comprised: 
 
 (a) A mortgage and loan agreement from Lanepoint Enterprises to Bowesco to secure an alleged loan of $5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">(b) A mortgage and loan agreement from Forestview Nominees to Bowesco to secure an alleged loan of $2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">(c) A mortgage and loan agreement from Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd to Rompride Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Erley Unit Trust to secure an alleged loan of $7 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">(d) Three mortgages and loan agreements from Silkchime to Erley Pty Ltd as trustee for the Erley Unit Trust to secure an alleged loan of $250,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">

81 Mr Carey is the sole director and shareholder of Rompride and a director and secretary and 50% shareholder of Erley Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">It appears from the various company records that no money had been lent by Bowesco to Lanepoint Enterprises apart from $700,000 paid to Lanepoint Enterprises as part of the $2 million run around.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">There was no record in the management accounts of Forestview Nominees to show any funds were paid to it by Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The accounts of Warwick showed a loan owing to the Erley Unit Trust of $4,910,467.03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">There was no record in the accounts of Silkchime to show any funds owing to Erley Pty Ltd or the Erley Unit Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">82 This review of the affidavit evidence, particularly of Mr Gomm and Mr Zohar, does not purport to be exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">It is sufficient however, in my opinion, to indicate that those who had the control of the affairs of the Westpoint Group may have been involved in serious contravention of their statutory duties as directors and officers of various companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">They may also have incurred liabilities under the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">The range and complexity of questionable transactions is great and the potential losses to investors in the Group and other creditors are substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">In my opinion each of the defendants is potentially liable in respect of all or some of the matters to which reference has already been made in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">In so saying I express no concluded view as to whether any particular contraventions have occurred or any particular liability has been incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">83 In addition to the matters referred to above, ASIC's submissions identified other areas of potential contraventions of statutory obligations which may give rise to liability on the part of the individual defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Numerous Information Memoranda were issued by the Mezzanine Companies in order to attract retail investors to the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">York Street Mezzanine distributed at least eleven of these between May 2000 and September 2002, as well as three others which were undated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">84 There are serious grounds for the argument developed by ASIC in its submissions that these and other Information Memoranda relied upon to attract mezzanine retail investors were misleading or deceptive in various important respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The Information Memoranda arguably misrepresented the total funds to be used as mezzanine finance for the respective developments to which they related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">For example, although Information Memoranda issued in relation to the Scots Church Development by York Street Mezzanine indicated a maximum of $40 million to be raised by that company, its database showed $118 million was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">It was submitted for ASIC that by allowing York Street Mezzanine to raise funds in excess of $40 million, the director of that company had arguably breached their duties under ss 180 and 181 of the Corporations Act to act in good faith and for proper purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">85 It was also said to be arguable, and I accept, that the Information Memoranda issued by York Street Mezzanine may have falsely represented that moneys raised would be applied specifically by way of a cash loan to the relevant Development Company which was Scots Church Development Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">However no cash funds were ever lent to that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The investors money was paid instead to Westpoint Corporation and mixed with other funds held by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">The closest that Scots Church Development seems to have got to the money was a book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">86 Many examples of express and implied representations in Information Memoranda and other documents such as Investor Updates issued by the Mezzanine Companies were identified by ASIC in its submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">87 ASIC also submitted that whether or not Mr Carey was a director of the Mezzanine Companies, he was an officer or director by virtue of his control and his conduct in relation to them and this too was detailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The involvement of the Westpoint Corporation and Mr Carey personally in the promotion of mezzanine finance raisings was evidenced in the first affidavit of Kevin Chin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">88 ASIC also referred to evidence from transcript examinations of Messrs Beck and Dixon indicative at least of a lack of attention to the use to which money raised from investors was to be put within the Group and the content of Information Memoranda issued by the Group in the name of the Mezzanine Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Mr Beck himself was in a position of potential conflict as it appears he was paid commission by the Westpoint Group for fund raising including attracting retail mezzanine investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">There is evidence to suggest that the redemption of primary notes was a matter for decision by Messrs Rundle and Carey according to priorities which they determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">89 In the event, ASIC submitted that, given the complexity of the Westpoint Group and the questionable nature of a large number of transactions between its companies, the most appropriate method of preserving its assets would be by granting the proposed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">There is said to be at present considerable doubt that the existence and location of many of the assets and the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">ASIC submits that this, coupled with the allegation of serious wrong doing in the context of assets being dealt with, justifies the making of the orders sought on the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">
 Property held by the first to fourth defendants 

90 The affidavit of Marcus Essex Claridge sworn 30 March 2006 set out the results of searches of various databases for property held in the name of the first to fourth defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">Mr Claridge searched Land Title Registers or databases in each of the Australian States and Territories, the Register of Boats in those States and Territories, the Register of Race Horses in New South Wales and the Register of Motor Vehicles in the State and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">91 The only interest shown in the name of the first defendant, Norman Carey, was a 16.66% interest in a race horse 'Great Nation' registered in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">92 Graeme Rundle was found to be the registered proprietor of two lots on strata plans in Perth and the registered proprietor as joint tenant with Jane Rundle of two lots at Mermaid Waters and Mermaid Beach, Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">He is also the registered owner of a Ford Territory passenger car registered in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">93 Mr Beck was shown to have an interest as joint tenant with Anna Harris in some 22 lots mainly in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">He was also shown as a trustee with Anna Harris of a lot situated on the Gold Coast in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">In addition Mr Beck has an interest in a boat called the Sea Eagle registered in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">94 John Dixon is a joint tenant with Helen Mary Dixon of a quarter share of a lot in Queensland and another lot in the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">He also has an interest in an open boat and a 2000 Porsche motor vehicle registered in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The position of the defendants 
 
95 The defendants have not made any substantive or detailed response to the ASIC evidence indicative of wide ranging misconduct in the affairs of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Mr Carey has put on no affidavit evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Mr Rundle says, via his solicitor, that he is a person of limited means and that he has not travelled overseas since August 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">He denies ownership of certain of the property attributed to him by Mr Claridge in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">96 Mr Beck denies the allegation by ASIC that, as a director of the Mezzanine Companies, he acted in accordance with instructions from Messrs Carey and Rundle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">He says that he has taken no steps to hide or move any of his assets or those of any other person or entity out of the reach of creditors as a result of the collapse of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">He offers undertakings and also offers to surrender his passport to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">He sets out his financial position, which shows assets of $2.485 million and liabilities of $4.28 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The properties disclosed by Mr Claridge's searches are said to be held by Mr Beck and his wife as trustees of the Beck Unit Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">He is also a beneficiary of other discretionary trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">97 Mr Dixon, like Mr Beck, denies he acted under instructions from Messrs Carey and Rundle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">He denies having taken any steps to hide or move his assets or those of any other person or entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">He, like Mr Beck, offers undertakings and offers to surrender his passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Conclusion 
 
98 In my opinion ASIC has demonstrated that it is necessary and desirable, within the meaning of s 1323(1) that the Court make orders to protect potential claimants against the defendants in respect of liabilities which may be imposed upon them for contraventions of the Corporations Act and other statutes and for breach of common law and fiduciary duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">99 In my opinion, the misconduct indicated by the evidence is wideranging and serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The precise locus of responsibility for that misconduct and the identification of any liabilities which may arise will require further careful investigation and in the meantime the protection of any assets that may be available to satisfy such liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">Although the appointment of receivers is a drastic step, I am satisfied that in the serious circumstances of this case, it is justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">I do not think that the necessary protection can be achieved by way of freezing orders or the acceptance of undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">100 ASIC has submitted minutes of proposed orders in relation to the various defendants and for the most part I am content to make orders in terms of those minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">The powers proposed for the receivers have been moderated and I have further qualified them in the orders I propose to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">One issue of concern is the proposed order that the receivers' reasonable costs and expenses should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">ASIC has made some submissions in that regard and I will give the defendants the opportunity to respond to those submissions before making an order as to the costs of the receivers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">I will make the travel restraint orders which are sought and the general orders authorising the plaintiff to give notice of the orders to relevant authorities, banks, building societies and financial institutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">The appointment of the receivers will be limited in time rather than open-ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">I will limit their appointment in the first instance to a term of six months which may be extended upon application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">It will also, of course, be possible to apply to terminate their appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">The power of the receivers in respect of the property of the defendants will extend, as requested by ASIC, to the identification, preservation and securing of individual property for the benefit of potential creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">It will not however extend to the 'collecting' of property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">Affidavits of assets will also be required to be filed by each of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">There will, of course, be liberty to apply to vary the orders according to changed circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">I will direct that the defendants pay ASIC's costs of the application.</sentence>
