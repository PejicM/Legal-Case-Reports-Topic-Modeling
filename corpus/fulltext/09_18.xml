 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In May 2001, with the consent of all the parties, District Registrar Robson ordered that the lands the subject of various native title applications in and around the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory be divided into two areas: areas A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Area A essentially included the lands within the urban areas of Darwin and Area B essentially included the lands in areas surrounding Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Following that order, those parts of the various native title applications relating to the lands in Area A were consolidated into one set of proceedings: NTD6033 of 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">This native title application and a number of similar applications where Mr Quall was the authorised applicant on behalf of a native title claim group ('the Quall applicants') became part of the consolidated proceedings, along with a number of native title applications where Mr Risk was the authorised applicant on behalf of a different native title claim group ('the Risk applicants').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 (' Risk' ) Mansfield J dismissed the consolidated proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That dismissal affected this native title application and 18 other native title applications insofar as they related to areas of land within Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, those parts of this native title application and one other Quall native title application (NTD6026 of 1998) relating to areas of land in Area B were not dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The Northern Territory was the main respondent to the 19 native title applications in Risk and remains so in relation to this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It has now applied to strike out this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">To avoid confusion with the primary native title application, in these reasons, I will refer to the Northern Territory's application as the, or this, "strike out application" and the primary native title application as the, or this, "native title application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The Northern Territory relies on three grounds for this strike out application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">First, it claims that all of the critical issues in this native title application were determined in Risk and therefore an issue estoppel arises to prevent those same issues being raised again for determination in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Secondly, it claims that in such circumstances, it is an abuse of process to raise the same issues again for determination in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Finally, it claims that in such circumstances, this native title application has no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Northern Territory's strike out application therefore requires an identification of the critical issues that were determined in Risk , the critical issues that are raised for determination in this native title application and a comparison between the two sets of issues to determine whether the issue estoppel arises, or whether the abuse of process exists, or whether the issues raised for determination have no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I will consider these matters hereunder beginning with a consideration of the procedural history of this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 Original native title application on behalf of the Dangalaba Clan 
 
5 This native title application has a lengthy and complex procedural history and it is set against an even more lengthy and complex background of native title applications under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NT Act') and proceedings under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth) ('the ALR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">This native title application was originally lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal by Mr Kevin Lance ("Tibby") Quall on 21 October 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">At that time, the printed application form was completed so as to state that it was being made by the applicant, Mr Quall, and others, as claimants on behalf of the Dangalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Apart from annexing a three page statement of the native title rights and interests claimed, it contained no detail of what the Dangalaba clan was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It described the lands that were the subject of the native title application, or the claim area, as: "all vacant Crown (sic land) within the "Hundred of Ayers", "Shire of Litchfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">" Also all mangrove habitat, the waters and tributaries of "Hancock Reach" and "Middle Arm" lying within the "Hundred of Ayers" excluding freehold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">" The lands in question are located south-east of Darwin and south of Palmerston in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I interpolate that in 1994, before this native title application was lodged, the Northern Territory Government compulsorily acquired an area of land immediately to the north of the claim area for the purposes of constructing the East Arm Port, which subsequently became the new port facility for Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Some details of this acquisition process are recorded in Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378 ( 'Quall' ) at [16]-[17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">May 2000 amendments to the native tile application 
 
6 Following the amendments to the NT Act in 1998, this native title application became an application in this Court, where it was given the file number NTD 6013 of 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">On 3 May 2000, it was substantially amended following leave given by O'Loughlin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">No doubt these amendments were prompted by the 1998 amendments to the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The amended form of this native title application was a much more elaborate document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Quall was named as the authorised applicant, again on behalf of the members of the Dangalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In Part A, Section 2, Mr Quall's authorisation as the applicant was stated to have been given at a meeting that was held at 6 Hack Court, Malak, Northern Territory on 4 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In Schedule A, the Dangalaba clan (now spelt Danggalaba, which spelling I will adopt henceforth in these reasons) was said to comprise of:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Kevin Lance (Tibby) Quall (also the applicant)
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Ronald Keith Quall
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Diana Deeja Quall
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Phillip Rupert Quall
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Kevin Andrew Quall
 
6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Natasha Anne Quall
 
7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Sarah Audrey Quall
 
8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Linda Muriel Quall
 
7 The amended application related to the same areas of land but they were described somewhat more precisely in Schedule B, as follows: "all vacant Crown land within the Hundred of Ayers and Shire of Litchfield, including all vacant crown land to the low water mark, all mangrove habitat, the waters and tributaries of Haycock Reach and Middle Arm lying within the Hundred of Ayers, excepting the area of water subject to the Paspaley Pearl Farm lease which is situated within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">"
 
8 The basis of the application was described in Schedule F and Attachment S. Schedule F, among other things, stated that:
 (a) Association with the area A description of the Native Title Rights and Interests claimed is attached as Attachment S (factual basis).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The attachment also describes the native claim group's Ancestors and the Descendents of those persons who are the predecessors of those who had an association with the subject area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">(b) Traditional laws and customs Danggalaba Traditional Laws and Customs are still continuing up until the present, as there is the existence of Sacred Sites in the subject area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Traditional Laws and Customs are observed by the claimants through their spiritual and ceremonial affiliation which shows clearly their association with the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">(c) Continuing to hold native title Ownership is described in accordance with the on-going traditional rights and interests in the subject area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The native title claim group continues to hold native title with Traditional Laws and Customs taught by our Elders who have passed on, and by those who are present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The transmission of knowledge is so important to the Rights of the claimants that they establish ownership and have to mean our legal rights are recognised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Our Traditional Laws and Customs have been continued throughout time by the Danggalaba Ancestors exclusively and is continued by the Descendents who are members of the native title claim group and members of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Further description of our native title rights and interests are contained in Attachment S. 
9 Attachment S --- an attachment of some significance, as will appear later in these reasons --- was a ten page document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It began with the following statement:
 Factual basis for the native title rights and interests claimed 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The following description of the history and structure, native title rights and interests, spiritual affiliation, association with the area, and activities undertaken, has been prepared in relation to the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The information covers the land and waters subject to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The members of the native title claim group are all members of the Danggalaba clan, however, the applicant acknowledges that the information contained in Attachment S applies to a broader group than the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The native title claim group is therefore not claiming association with the area in accordance with traditional laws and customs, nor native title rights and interests to the exclusion of other members of the Danggalaba clan who are not members of this native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">10 Then, in paragraph 4 of Attachment S, the Danggalaba clan's identity vis-&agrave;-vis the Kulumbiringin Larrakia tribe was described as follows: 
 The Danggalaba members, traditionally of the Kulumbiringin Larrakia tribe are of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It was during the Kenbi Land Claim that all aboriginal claimants were borne out by the context of the evidence that all claimants were Larrakia, those who are claimants within the whole traditional boundary are within the Larrakia language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It is at this point that our group did not agree and that we did not adopt Professor Peter Sutton's new tribe and fought very hard for many years to be recognised separately and to be represented legally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Finally Justice Gray ordered that we were to be separated from the Larrakia group and that is the way it remains legally today and that is why we are arguing for the same reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">And later at paragraph 14, as follows:
 Despite disease, Chief Protectors, Native Welfare, Aboriginal Policy, Colonisation, Reserves, Missions, Settlements, Homes, ignorance and racism, the Danggalaba, the only remaining Kulumbiringin (Larrakia) tribal clan to survive, are active today trying, against all odds to seek an equality of life and justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Kenbi Land Claim, the Danggalaba clan and disputes with the Risk applicants 
 
11 At this point, it is convenient to digress to say something about The Kenbi (Cox Peninsula) Land Claim No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">37 ('the Kenbi Land Claim') that is mentioned in the paragraphs immediately above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Kenbi Land Claim was made under the ALR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The land claimed in it is located on the Cox Peninsula which lies across the harbour from the city of Darwin and includes land surrounding the West and Middle Arms of Port Darwin: see Risk at [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The land within the city of Darwin could not be claimed under the ALR Act because "unalienated Crown land" is the only land claimable under that Act and land within a town is expressly excluded from the definition of that expression in the ALR Act: see s 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">12 Some details of the long history of the Kenbi Land Claim, the litigation associated with it and the competing claimant groups that emerged during it, are set out in the introductory paragraphs to the Kenbi Land Claim Report delivered by Gray J on 12 December 2000 ('the Kenbi Report'), as follows:
 History of the claim The application in the present claim was received on 20 March 1979 by Mr Justice Toohey, the first Aboriginal Land Commissioner under the Land Rights Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Even before that, in the first report of the Royal Commission which led to the introduction of the Land Rights Act, Mr Justice Woodward referred to the dispossession of the Larrakia people and their desire to acquire title to land in and around Darwin for community living purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">A claim was made to the Interim Land Commissioner in 1975 for part of the Cox Peninsula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">When the Land Rights Act came into operation, the part of the Cox Peninsula now known as the Belyuen community became Aboriginal land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The long history of the land claim is largely the result of litigation associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Before it was lodged, the Northern Territory Government promulgated regulations which had the effect of rendering the Cox Peninsula unclaimable, by classifying it as land in a town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The High Court of Australia held that the first Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey, was obliged to decide whether these regulations were invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The fourth Commissioner, Justice Olney, held that the regulations were invalid, because they were made for the purpose of preventing a claim to the Cox Peninsula under the Land Rights Act, not for the purpose of town planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That decision was upheld by the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court refused special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In the meantime, there were legal proceedings involving the second Commissioner, Mr Justice Kearney, the High Court and the Federal Court, on the question whether the Northern Territory Government was obliged to disclose certain documents in its possession, relating to the validity of the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The third Commissioner, Mr Justice Maurice, was also disqualified from hearing the claim by the Federal Court on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias, as a result of some remarks he made during the hearing of another land claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In 1989 and 1990, Justice Olney conducted a lengthy inquiry into the land claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">His Honour produced a report, in which he concluded that there were no traditional Aboriginal owners of the land claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">That finding was set aside by the Federal Court and the matter came to me, the fifth Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The claim has undergone changes over the years as to the manner in which it has been put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Even during my inquiry, between 1995 and 1999, a group of people who were not claimants at the outset asked me to treat them as claimants, and some people who were part of one claimant group asked that they be treated as a separate claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">These changes required the preparation and dissemination of material and the hearing of evidence not contemplated when the inquiry began.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">By the end of my inquiry, four groups of claimants were attempting to establish that their members are traditional Aboriginal owners of the land claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">For convenience, these groups are called the Tommy Lyons group, the Larrakia group, the Belyuen group and the Danggalaba group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">13 To put these statements in context, the Larrakia group referred to above, is the same group in the Risk applicants: see [429] at Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Northern Land Council represented the Risk applicants in both Risk and in the Kenbi Land Claim proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Some of the people identified as the Danggalaba group members in the Kenbi Land Claim were among the Quall applicants in Risk : see Risk at [429].</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In the Kenbi Report, Gray J summarised his conclusions that the Larrakia group was a local descent group under the ALR Act and that the Danggalaba group was not, as follows:
 The Larrakia group consists of 1 293 people and is based on a single principle of descent, namely descent from a recognised ancestor of the Larrakia language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The group is bound together by its linguistic affiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Although I have doubts as to whether it is properly described as 'local', I am bound by authority to hold that the Larrakia group is a local descent group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Danggalaba group consists of an indeterminate number of people said to be descended from a member of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Those who contend for the existence of this group sought to be represented separately from other members of the Larrakia group and to make a claim to the exclusion of all other groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They contended, but did not establish, that an error had been made in the genealogies of the Larrakia group and that a man shown on those genealogies as the son of a key ancestor had been the husband of that ancestor, and the adoptive father of her children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Danggalaba group is not a group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Not all of the putative members of the Danggalaba group accept the principle of a descent on which the group is said to be based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Some do not accept that they are members of such a group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Danggalaba group is not a local descent group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">14 However, it must be emphasised that the ALR Act sets out substantially different criteria for a successful land claim to that set out in the NT Act for a successful native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The differences between the two pieces of legislation in these respects are mentioned by Mansfield J in Risk at [437] and are aptly summarised in Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia (2006) 165 FCR 300 at [71] --- [74] per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It follows that these findings of Gray J in the Kenbi Report cannot be transposed to either this native title application, or the Risk native title applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Nonetheless, they did provide some forewarning of the difficulties Mr Quall might face in the future in attempting to assert the claims of the Danggalaba Clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Competing native title applications lodged by Larrakia/Risk applicants and Danggalaba/Quall applicants 
 
15 Not surprisingly, these disputes between the Larrakia/Risk applicants and the Danggalaba/Quall applicants in the Kenbi Land Claim have also emerged in the form of competing native title applications under the NT Act over the same areas of lands and waters in and around Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In Quall , O'Loughlin J described a part of those disputes as follows:
 It is now necessary to recount some of the troubled history of the Larrakia native title claims and Mr Quall's involvement in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It will be sufficient, for the moment, to say that, through Mr Risk, the Larrakia people have made several claims for determinations of native title over land and waters in the Darwin area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It is also sufficient to say that Mr Quall has also made many like claims on behalf of the Danggalaba Clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">However, whereas the Larrakia claims are over relatively larges areas, Mr Quall's claims have been over smaller areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Two points of importance must be stressed: 
 
 &#8226; all the Danggalaba's claims are within the perimeters of the Larrakia's claims and, as a consequence, there is overlapping; 
 
 
 
 &#8226; most of the Danggalaba's claims were either lodged for or considered for registration by the Tribunal before the Larrakia's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 

His Honour then went on to describe the litigation surrounding six such native title applications Mr Quall had registered with the National Native Title Tribunal over areas of land within the larger Larrakia/Risk native title applications which eventually resulted in the registration of those six applications being set aside --- one by order of O'Loughlin J and five by consent following that order: see Quall at [26] --- [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Attachment S to the May 2000 amendments 
 
16 Returning to Attachment S to the May 2000 amendments to this native title application (ie further to [9]-[10] above), the "Danggalaba Model and Heritage" was described later in that attachment, under that heading, as follows:
 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The model of the Danggalaba Clan shows the genealogical and ancestral descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The genealogy of the upper level is attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">This evidence is relevant to the Kenbi Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Previous anthropological research on the Larrakia was conducted by Based (sic Basedow) Spencer, Warner, Elkin, Bandit McCarthy, Walsh, Rose Sutton and Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">All confirm that the subject area is undisputed Larrakia country and not claimed by other groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Early ethnographers (Spencer, Elkin, Berndt and McCarthy, cited in Brandl, Walsh 1979: 15) confirmed the Larrakia historically were comprised of exogamous clans each having its own "totem" or "dreaming", were inherited from the father (see Brandl, Haritos and Walsh 1979; 15-16, 154-155).</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It was, and still is the same patrilineal group, we are still the same spiritual dreaming, nothing has changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The above statement is true although we are not history, we are still alive and kicking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The clan remains intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The native title claimant group traced their descent from the Dungalaba ancestors, who are not designated in the Northern Land Council anthropological genealogy they recommend the Larrakia prepared for the Kenbi Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Their reference K.G.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">12-19 is the Deeja Bilawuk Batcho families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Native Title Claim Group not only has matrilineal connection but have during the Kenbi Land Claim clearly stated patrilineal descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">For this reason we do not belong to the Larrakia sub-group/family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">And for this reason Tommy Lyons Imabulk K.G.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">3 is also a separate group identified during the Kenbi Land Claim having apical ancestral connection of the upper level, being patrilineal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The survival of the clan is apparent to the model and kinship of the Dungalaba Clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Several clans once existed a long time ago, but not that long ago that Aboriginal people cannot remember their descent from such ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was during the Second World War that many Larrakia people were displaced and died from sickness having been sent to foreign country around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It is through the upheaval, misfortunes and dislocations that preceded, that the Dungalaba Clan, the traditional people for this country, now exists to carry on the tradition and customs for this country which is called Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Darwin and Cox Peninsula is within the area occupied by Aboriginal people speaking the language known as Larrakia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The traditional land area of the boundary is Cox Peninsula and islands to the Finniss River, along the river going north of Darwin River to 47 miles to the Marrakii Crossing along Adelaide River to Gunn Point including the Vernon Islands along the coast to Cape Hotham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Native Title Claim Groups, Danggalaba Model 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The Tomy Lyons (dec) Group Frank Belyeun Secretary (dec) Boby Secretary (dec) Topsy Secretary and families (dec Olga Singh (dec) Linda Danks (dec) and families Prince of Wales Jason Singh Raylene Singh Zoe Singh Kathy Mimyama Batcho Families Pat Lawrie (dec Sam Gunduk (dec) Dolly Gurrinyee (dec) Victor Williams (dec) and families Lindy Quall (dec) and families Yula Williams and families Lucy May and families Mary Raymond and families Rona Ally and families 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">We are not a language group, incorporated company group, association inc, we are a Clan group, a traditional tribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Once when our ancestors were abundant and thriving, there existed the traditional Aboriginal society made up of clan groups who lived in the Darwin area and greater Darwin Rural area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">... 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The Danggalaba clan are people who have links and have always kept together and respected each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It is a major factor in maintaining our attachment to the land, sites and spiritual dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The clan is the landowners, the lawmakers and custodians of the Danggalaba heritage and culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Because other clans no longer exist we are considered the "bosses" for this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">A language group cannot take over our clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">We are "bosses", the traditional owners because we have heritage and culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">We inherited the knowledge to show that we exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The Danggalaba clan succeeds traditional ownership because of the fact that no other clan exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The knowledge of sacred significance has been passed on to us by way of ceremonial Aboriginal traditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">By Aboriginal way, the knowledge proves family ownership of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It is important to bear in mind that these assertions were made in Attachment S in this native title application some seven months before Gray J delivered the Kenbi Report where the existence of the Danggalaba Clan as a separate local descent group was rejected, albeit under the ALR Act: see [13] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">17 It is relatively clear from these statements in Attachment S that as at May 2000, the Quall applicants were asserting that:
 
a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Danggalaba Clan was the sole surviving clan of the Larrakia people (see paragraphs 17 and 26).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The Danggalaba Clan comprised the traditional Aboriginal people for Larrakia country (see paragraph 16) which was described as including Darwin itself and the greater Darwin area extending to Cox Peninsula and the islands to the West, Finniss River to Marrakai Crossing in the south and Adelaide River to Cape Hotham in the west (see paragraphs 17 and 18).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">c. The Danggalaba was a patrilineal descent group (see paragraph 17).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 d. The claims of the Quall applicants were quite separate and distinct from the claims of the Larrakia group in the Kenbi Land Claim (see paragraphs 17 and 26).</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">e. However, the Danggalaba clan claim group did not make its claims to the exclusion of other members of the Danggalaba clan who were not members of this claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">In this respect, the heading to paragraph 21 "Native Title Claim Groups" is probably intended to indicate the other members of the Danggalaba clan beyond the eight listed in Schedule A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 

f. The Danggalaba clan was not a language group or incorporated association (see paragraph 22) --- presumably this is a reference to the Larrakia/Risk group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">July 2000 --- further amendments --- do not alter substance 
 
 18 On 12 July 2000, O'Loughlin J gave leave to Mr Quall to further amend this native title application by adding three attachments to Schedule B that had been omitted in error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Those attachments contained detailed descriptions of the longitude and latitude references for the land the subject of this native title application, but did not alter the substance of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">April 2001 --- another native title application by Mr Quall on behalf of Danggalaba clan struck out 
 
19 On the same day as Mr Quall was given leave to amend this native title application, ie 3 May 2000, O'Loughlin J set trial dates for a related native title application where Mr Quall was the named applicant (NTD6044 of 1998) and two native title applications where Mr Risk was the named applicant, over the same areas of land in the East Arm area near Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Those areas of land are immediately to the north of the lands claimed in this native title application and are within the Area A part of this native title application that was subsequently dismissed in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The trial of these native title applications was to commence in Darwin on Monday 19 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">20 When that trial began on 19 March 2001, Mr Risk applied to have the hearing of his two native title applications adjourned and, at the same time, he applied to have Mr Quall's native title application struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Risk's strike out application was supported by the Northern Territory, among others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It was put on three bases: that Mr Quall had failed to comply with various orders of the Court; that the native title application did not comply with s 61(4) of the NT Act, relating to the identification of the native title claim group; and that the native title application had no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">21 O'Loughlin J heard Mr Risk's application and decided he had no alternative but to dismiss Mr Quall's native title application: see Quall at [77].</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In coming to that conclusion, O'Loughlin J dealt at length with Mr Quall's inability to describe the native title claim group he claimed to represent in that application, ie the Danggalaba clan - the same Danggalaba clan as Mr Quall claimed to represent in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">22 In Quall, O'Loughlin J began by noting the fundamental differences between the position taken by Mr Risk in his native title applications and the position taken by Mr Quall in his, as follows (at [5]):
 The result thus far is that two aboriginal groups have made competing claims for native title over the same area of land and water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Larrakia people, represented by Mr Risk, are prepared to include Mr Quall and the Danggalaba clan as part of their native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">That, however, is not acceptable to Mr Quall; he maintains that the Danggalaba clan, to the exclusion of those who are represented by Mr Risk, alone has the native title rights over the land and waters that are the subject of the two sets of proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">And further ( Quall at [22]):
 ... Mr Quall will not accept, as sufficient or appropriate, the inclusion of members of the Danggalaba clan in the Larrakia application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He claims that those whom he represents wish to be separately represented as they are of the view that their interests do not correspond with those of the Larrakia people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It will be noted that this is the same position as Mr Quall expressed in Attachment S in this native title application, as set out above at [16] and [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">23 O'Loughlin J noted that Mr Quall asserted he was making his native title application: "... on behalf of the Danggalaba clan, a group that he identified as being 'traditionally of the Kulumbiringin Larrakia tribe' ....": Quall at [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It will be noted that this description of the native title claim group is the same as that described in the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [6] and, particularly [9], above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">His Honour then turned to consider who it was that Mr Quall represented, ie who the native title claim group was ( Quall at [36]-[59]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">First, he noted that in the original native title application filed with the Native Title Tribunal on 29 September 1998, Mr Quall claimed the application was made "... on behalf of the applicant and others as claimants", described as "the Danggalaba clan": Quall at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">No other details were provided of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">This is similar to the original form of this native title application (see [5] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">24 Secondly, O'Loughlin J noted that in the first of three amendments made between September and November 1999, Mr Quall described the capacity in which he claimed to make the application as "claimants of the native title group" identified as eight people, who had authorised him to make the application on behalf of the group at a meeting held at 6 Hack Court, Malak.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Whilst O'Loughlin J has not recorded the date of this meeting, because the address is identical, I infer that it was the same meeting at which Mr Quall was authorised to make the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [6] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Further, whilst the eight people are not named by O'Loughlin J, I infer that they, too, are the same eight people who comprised the native title group described in Schedule A of the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [6] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">25 Thirdly, O'Loughlin J noted that Mr Quall made a "significant shift" when he identified the native title claim group in his points of claim (filed on 23 February 2001), as follows ( Quall at [40]):
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Applicant group is a group of Aboriginal people who are known as Danggalaba who have genealogical and ancestral connections (through actual and putative descent from) as an indigenous community since time immemorial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">' ... 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The Danggalaba are descendants of ancestors of Danggalaba Aboriginal people who survived the frontier of colonialism of Northern Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The Ancestors of the claimant group, Danggalaba are: TIMBAT, BLANCHIE, PAT LAWRIE GUDADJIK, GUNDOOK (SAM), GURRINYEE (DOLLY), BILLAWUK (DEEJA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">26 His Honour then observed (at [41]):
 This identification of the group in the points of claim is at variance with the description of the native title claim group in Mr Quall's original application; it is also at variance with the contents of his earlier amended applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Of greater significance however, is the fact that it is not identical to the group description that is contained in other documents that were in the same bundle of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I turn then to identify the more significant of those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">27 In one of the documents in the bundle of documents O'Loughlin J then turned to consider, his Honour noted Mr Quall described the applicant group in a way that contradicted the identity of the claim group in other papers ( Quall at [43]), as follows:
 The Native Title Claim group, the Danggalaba Clan does not exclude anybody who has similar claims to the land and self identify as a Danggalaba Kulumbiringin Aboriginal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Native Title Claimants, Danggalaba Model ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The membership of the Danggalaba Clan have a principal dreaming UNGA the Crocodile DANGGALABA gunimidjinda, saltwater specie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The Families include: The Tommy Lyons (Dec) group Frank Belyuen Secretary (Dec) Bobby Secretary (Dec) Topsy, Secretary and families (Dec) Olga Singh (Dec) Linda Danks (Dec) and families Prince of Wales Jason Singh Raylene Singh Zoe Singh Kathy Mimyama Batcho Families Pat Lawrie (Dec) Sam Bunduk (Dec) Dolly Gurrinyee (Dec) Victor Williams (Dec) and families Lindy Williams and families Yula Williams and families Lucy May and families Mary Raymond and families Rona Ally and families' 
It will be noted that these statements and the listed membership of the Danggalaba Clan are similar or, in some respects, identical to the statements contained in Attachment S of the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [8] above, re the non-exclusive nature of the native title claim group, and [16(21)] above, re the membership of the Danggalaba Clan).</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">28 After reviewing the contents of a number of affidavits made by Mr Quall and others that O'Loughlin J thought contained differing and confusing descriptions of the native title claim group Mr Quall claimed to represent ( Quall at [44] --- [52]), his Honour concluded with the following observations ( Quall at [58]):
 I find myself unable to identify, with any degree of certainty, the composition of the native title claim group that Mr Quall says he represents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">As I have said, the information in his proposed amended application is at odds with his points of claim, with his accompanying affidavit, with his original family of eight and with the information in his bundle of documents called "Factual basis for the Native Title Rights and interests claim".</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">29 O'Loughlin J ultimately concluded ( Quall at [76]) that:
 There is however, in this particular case, the failure by Mr Quall --- repeatedly --- to identify the native claim group whom he claims to represent with appropriate particularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">That deficiency can only be regarded as fatal: and, after two and a half years, I have no confidence that the deficiency can be remedied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Furthermore, there is the further problem that Mr Quall has not advanced any material that would suggest that he has the authority of the members of his alleged group to make an application on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">30 That, of course, brought an end to Mr Quall's native title application numbered NTD6044 of 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">However, Mr Quall had numerous other native title applications on foot at the time, including this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Whilst the decision in Quall did not directly affect this native title application, given the close similarity between the two native title applications and, particularly the descriptions Mr Quall gave of the native title claim group in Quall and those in this native title application, that decision did serve as yet a further forewarning of the difficulties Mr Quall could face in the future in attempting to assert the native title claims of the Danggalaba Clan --- this time in the context of the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">May 2001 --- the Risk consolidated proceedings 
 
31 As mentioned above, in May 2001, this native title application and a number of other native title applications, insofar as they related to the lands in Area A, ie the urban areas of Darwin, were consolidated into a single proceeding: see Risk at [3].</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">There were three different groups of native title applicants affected by that consolidation order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">They are identified in Risk (at [2]) as the Larrakia applicants, ie the first applicants in Risk , the Quall applicants, ie the second applicants in Risk and the Roman applicants, ie the third applicants in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The Risk applicants are obviously the same group as the Risk applicants that have already been referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The Roman applicants subsequently obtained leave to discontinue their application (see Risk at [13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">32 The Quall applicants had lodged eleven native title applications in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Mr Quall was named as the authorised applicant in each: see Risk at [2].</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The eleven native title applications included this native title application, eight other similar applications and two other different ones: numbered NTD6018 and NTD6019 of 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">As counsel for the Northern Territory pointed out in submissions before me, the latter two native title applications were in the same form as this native title application was after the May 2000 amendments: (see [6]-[10] and [16]-[17] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Specifically, the latter two applications were said to be made on behalf of the Danggalaba Clan comprising eight people with the surname Quall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The other nine Quall applications were affected by further amendments, details of which are set out immediately below: see [33]-[37].</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This distinction between the two sets of Quall applications is mentioned in Risk at [10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">October 2001 amendments --- change to Kulumbiringin native title claim group 
 
33 On 29 October 2001, Mansfield J gave Mr Quall leave to make a number of further amendments to the first nine native title applications mentioned above, ie this native title application and native title applications numbered NTD6010, NTD6011, NTD6012, NTD6014, NTD6015, NTD6022, NTD6026 and NTD6029 of 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Those amendments made some significant changes to the name of the native title claim group, the membership thereof and the basis upon which each native title application was being pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">However, it is notable that the areas of land covered by this native title application remained the same, but they were described as Kulumbiringin land instead of Larrakia country (compare [16(16)], [16(18)] and [17b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">] above with [36-3] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The following paragraphs provide a summary of those amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">34 First, the name of the native title claim group was changed in Part A, Section 2 from the members of the Danggalaba clan to the Kulumbiringin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Secondly, schedule A was changed to claim that the native title claim group was comprised of Yula Williams and seven other people with the surname Williams, Mary Raymond and seven other people with the surname Raymond, Rona Alley and five other people with the surname Alley and Ron Quall and four other people with the surname Quall, including Mr Tibby Quall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">By comparison with the membership described in schedule A in the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [6] above), eight Williams, eight Raymonds, six Allys and Denise Quall were added and four people with the surname Quall were excluded, ie Kevin, Natasha, Sarah and Linda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However, with one exception I will mention in a moment, the membership of this claim group was essentially the same as that described in clause 21 of Attachment S in the May 2000 amended form of this native title application (see [16(21)] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">This suggests that the membership of the native title claim group was expanded to include all the members of the Danggalaba clan (see [17e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The notable exception is that the Tommy Lyons group has been omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The same omission has occurred in the recast form of Attachment S (see [36-4] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">35 Thirdly, some changes were made to Schedule F. The first part of it remained the same, including the section headed (a) association with the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">However, section (b), which was headed "traditional laws and customs", was changed to replace the Danggalaba clan with the Kulumbiringin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The same change was made throughout section (c) which was headed "continuing to hold native title".</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In addition, the following paragraphs were added to the end of Schedule F:
 The interest and rights we have is because we are the Kulumbiringin group (a traditional tribal concept).</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">We are a clan group that still exists since time immemorial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The rights and interests we share is the knowledge that has been passed on from ancestors of the past to the present decedents, who are today in claiming our heritage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The rights and interests come from traditional laws and customs by way of on-going ceremonies that have been done exclusively by Kulumbiringin men and women in the Darwin area and adjacent land, the Cox Peninsula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">We are connected by the Kulumbiringin dreaming tracks that come from creation time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Nothing has changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It is only by way of the Kulumbiringin ancestors that the knowledge is with us today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">We have our customary rights and interests passed on from ancestors who have maintained the customs and more through ceremonies and customs affiliated to our families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">... Further description of our native title rights and interest are contained in Attachment S 
36 Fourthly, Attachment S was substantially recast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Some parts were omitted entirely; other parts were retained, but placed under different headings with slightly different wording; and some parts were added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The following is a summary of the more significant changes:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The introductory clauses including the statement as to the non-exclusive nature of the native title claim group were omitted (see at [9(3)] and [17e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">This appears to be correlated to the expansion of the native title claim group to include all the members of the Danggalaba claim (see [34] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Consistent with the position they had adopted much earlier (see above), the Quall applicants make it clear in the concluding sentences of the recast version of Attachment S that they are separate and distinct from the Larrakia/Risk applicants, as follows:
 We do not share the same affiliations and attachments to other claimant groups of any other land claims, on the same land or subject areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">We have not given permission to the Northern Land Council to add our names to the Larrakeyah Language group claimants list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">We have not been consulted for authorisation to add our names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This theme is pursued at various points throughout Attachment S, as is exemplified in the following paragraphs (emphasis added):
 Our family were considered as part of the Aboriginal community at the time of [the "half caste policy" in force under the Aboriginal Protection Act (sic)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The records show that they were Larrakeyah people and that they were employed as such [during the mid 1900s].</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Our families were not taken away under the "half caste" policy because they were not considered as "half caste" and that they remained in Darwin all the time and worked as labourers, cooks, cleaners, housemaids, and many other employment duties for the Government establishments and private enterprises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Our families carried on the traditional customs and laws and that they were the ones that maintained the ceremonies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">To this day we would not recognise any of those persons who call themselves the Larrakeyah language group to have ever been to partake of any Larrakeyah ceremony of the past, let alone maintain such responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Our family participated in the ceremonies until it stopped at the Larrakeyah Barracks and moved to Cox Peninsular called Darramarrangamanidg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It was during the Kenbi land claim evidence showed that most larrakeyah language group learnt evidence from reading the material from books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">There is no other way, according to tradition laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Unlike, to actually belong to such a group as a language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">To say that everyone belongs to a language group is nonsense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The aboriginal law does not allow that sort of a group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Aboriginal descent and law and customs are determining the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">It is something that's there before you were born.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">You inherit it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It's the law and customs that distinguishes your presence and its not going away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">To belong to tradition is to remain within your culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">A language group means that all as a group having the same language denotes land owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Quite the opposite to moieties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The moiety system designates a division because of aboriginal law and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Aboriginal law and customs does not come from a language group or make a language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The paragraphs describing the identity of the Danggalaba Clan vis-&agrave;-vis the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin tribe (paragraphs 4 and 14 of the original Attachment S --- see at [10] above), the Danggalaba Model and Heritage (paragraphs 15-17 inclusive of the original Attachment S --- see at [16] above) and the Danggalaba membership (paragraphs 21-22 inclusive of the original Attachment S --- see at [16] above), have all been omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Instead, the native title claim group is described as the Aboriginal Kulumbiringin in the following terms (emphasis added):
 The Native Title Applicants are the Aboriginal Kulumbiringin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">We define our group as a kinship group, a Community group (collective family) and a local group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The group acknowledges and practices the traditional and customary cultural law because of its eternal connection to Aboriginal Land in the Darwin region, and subject areas, what we call Kulumbiringin land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Kulumbiringin is the original name of Aboriginal people who have lived here from time immemorial and still do at present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">It is the traditional name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">It is our language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">We consider that 'Larrakeyah' is a word that has been used in historical times to describe the Aboriginal people of the Darwin region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Nonetheless, this term will be used in this report where it has been used in referenced sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Our ancestors and our families have been named as being Larrakeyah, Kulumbiringin, Binimidginda and Gummajerrumba; (Basedow 1906).</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Clan names that have survived are Danggalaba and Marri.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The name that has been used the most to describe the aboriginal people who have a long history of Darwin has been the name Larrakeyah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">... T Secretary (deceased) A Elder, a Tribal leader, and a legitimate witness of land claims of Darwin and the Kenbi land claim distinguishes the word Larrakeyah as a non Aboriginal word and insists that the real word describing Aboriginal people of Darwin is Kulumbiringin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">It is only traditional Aboriginal name, for this land and its people who originated here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">It is not a name that was invented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">To follow one's decent traditionally supposes that the roots from the past must follow on to the present like ecology, a species survives if it keeps its link to the past strong and unbroken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">We, the native title claimant group members who have survived today, can show that we were connected to this land and that we have maintained this connection, which enables us to make the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">We claim our rightful ownership of this country and therefore have to exclude others who are not of the Kulumbiringin native title claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">We can produce numerous proofs of an ongoing connection to the land and to our traditional Ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The families who constitute the native title claimant group are a local group in every sense of the term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">We are indigenous to this country and we carry on a tradition of customs and law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The native title claimant group as a cultural group has a physical, cultural, spiritual affiliation to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">This group has a connection of spiritual and religious totems which are significantly attached to them and the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">In Aboriginal law, family groups hold a place of importance and hold customary roles, and responsibilities to practice and to withhold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The significance of such totems defines the relationship between people and land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The many sacred sites are our responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">We are custodians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">They are joined spiritually to us, it is our religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">To not recognise our spiritual attachment to the land is an insult to aboriginal culture and the aboriginal race of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Aboriginal law is one law which is designed for the purpose of connecting groups of people to the ongoing of aboriginal culture, it is recognised since the Mabo case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The membership of the Kulumbiringin claim group is described in the following terms:
 The member of the Kulumbiringin group can trace their descent through the apical ancestors: Sam Gundook (male), Dolly Gurrinyee (female) Dedja Batcho (female) were sisters and brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Their children include: Linda Quall (deceased) Mary Raymond, Rona Alley and Yula Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Yula's children, Linda's children, Mary's children and Rona's children are also descendants who constitute the native title claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Membership to this native title claimant group implies to be a descendant of Yula Williams, Linda Quall (deceased), Mary Raymond and Rona Alley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Members of the group can trace their descent to the Kulumbiringin apical ancestors either through the male and female line, a requirement for Aboriginal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Persons who are not Kulumbiringin by descent do not have a Kulumbiringin affiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The native title claimant group affiliation and connection to the land through law and customs hold a spiritual and religious attachment by Aboriginal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">37 From the time of the October 2001 amendments, throughout the hearing of the consolidated proceedings in Risk and, indeed, to the present time, this native title application has remained in the same form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">In particular, it was and is said to be made on behalf of the Kulumbiringin native title claim group as described in the foregoing paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">In one of the opening paragraphs of his decision in Risk , Mansfield J described the claims made in the various Quall native title applications, including this one, as follows ( Risk at [10] and [11]):
 Mr Quall is the named applicant for the second applicant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">As seen above, he filed 11 native title determination applications under the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The native title claim group is referred to in DG6018/1998 and DG6019/1998 as 'members of the Danggalaba Clan', comprising eight people, including Mr Quall, Ronald Keith Quall, Diana Deeja Quall, Phillip Rupert Quall, Kevin Andrew Quall, Natasha Anne Quall, Sarah Audrey Quall and Linda Muriel Quall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">In other applications, the native title claim group is referred to as the 'Kulumbiringin', comprising the descendents of Kulumbiringin ancestors 'according to Aboriginal law and custom', including four elders and their family groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The four elders include Yula Williams, Mary Raymond, Rona Alley and Ron Quall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">As noted, all of the individuals named in the Quall applications are listed as Larrakia people in the list of Larrakia people on whose behalf the Larrakia applications are made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Mr Quall, the named applicant for the second applicant group, submitted that the Larrakia people ought not be awarded native title over the claim area, as the group is simply a language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">He submitted that the members of the Larrakia applicant groups have lost their culture, and that it is the Danggalaba clan (or the Kulumbiringin clan) who have continued to observe and acknowledge traditional laws and customs and to maintain their connection to the relevant land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Quall applicants fall back to Danggalaba clan case 
 
38 However, during final submissions in Risk , Mr Quall elected not to further pursue the Kulumbiringin case, but instead reverted to the Danggalaba clan case as described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">In it's decision on Mr Quall's appeal from the decision in Risk: Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCAFC 46 (' Risk FC'), the Full Court described this change of position in the following terms ( Risk FC at [171 and[176]):
 [171] Mr Quall's oral submissions, to the extent they dealt with the issue of laws and customs of a society would again seem confirmatory of the relevant laws and customs being the Danggalaba's (the Kulumbiringin based claims seem, by this stage, to have been collapsed into the Danggalaba claims).</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">In particular, as the quotations we have given suggest, the tenor of what is said about laws and customs seems group specific (ie "our laws" and "Aboriginal laws and customs of other groups").</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">[176] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The applications in which the claim groups were framed as being named descendants of Kulumbiringin ancestors having fallen away in closing oral submissions (unsurprisingly given the evidence of three of the four named elders in the Quall/Kulumbiringin applications), his Honour was then left with the claim of the Danggalaba Larrakia clan --- a claim which, probably, was required to be assessed in light of the above finding but which his Honour rejected on another basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">It was this claim that his Honour addressed primarily in his reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Some of the evidentiary difficulties Mr Quall had in adducing evidence in support of both the Kulumbiringin case and the Danggalaba clan case are identified by Mansfield J in Risk at [796]-[797]: see [42 below].</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">September 2002 --- December 2004: the hearing of the consolidated proceedings in Risk 
 
39 The consolidated proceedings in Risk proceeded to hearing before Mansfield J between September 2002 and June 2004, with written submission continuing up to December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Mansfield J delivered his decision on 12 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">It is difficult to convey in words the enormity of the task undertaken by Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The hearing lasted 68 days in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">It involved 47 Aboriginal witnesses, 26 witnesses called by the respondents and numerous expert witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The evidence incorporated many thousands of pages of transcript and exhibits, including the transcript of the Kenbi Land Claim hearing (see Risk at [434]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The decision extended to almost 270 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">April 2006 - the decision in Risk --- all 19 native title applications dismissed 
 
40 After an extensive examination of the evidence and a thorough consideration of all the relevant issues, Mansfield J concluded that all of the 19 native title applications, including Mr Quall's eleven native title applications (in so far as they related to Area A), must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">41 In relation to all of the native title applications, his Honour concluded:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Within the geographical area which includes the claim area, at sovereignty (1825), at settlement (1869) and thereafter during the 19 th Century, there existed an Aboriginal society, namely the Larrakia peoples (which for convenience, his Honour assumed included both the Risk applicants and the Quall applicants: see at [96] and [794]), that had a normative system by reason of their traditional laws and customs which created rights and obligations possessed by them in relation to the land and waters of the claim area: see Risk at [232]-[233].</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The present society comprising the Larrakia peoples do not have rights and interests possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Larrakia peoples at sovereignty in the sense explained by the High Court in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria [2002] HCA 58 (' Yorta Yorta' ), because as a result of a combination of historical events which occurred during the 20 th Century there has been a substantial interruption in the practice of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia peoples as they existed at sovereignty and at settlement, so that their practise and enjoyment has not continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty (see Risk at [812]-[823] and summarised at [834]-[835]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">42 In relation to Mr Quall's eleven native title applications, his Honour's conclusions included the following ( Risk at [795]-[801] (emphasis added)):
 [795] ... for the reasons explained in this judgment, it has not led me to concluding that the current laws and customs governing the "Larrakia people" are "traditional" in the sense required by s 223(1)(a) of the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">[796] I reach the same conclusion if I address that issue concerning the laws and customs of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Mr Quall claimed that clan is the only one which has maintained the traditional laws and customs of the society which existed at sovereignty and to the present time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">I am mindful that I should distinguish between his evidence and his submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It is of course necessary to have regard to all his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">I have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">I also have regard to his submissions, but only to the extent that they have a foundation in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The assessment of his claim must also be made upon the whole of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">[797] Mr Quall was clearly not supported by other persons (other than his sister) who, he said, were members of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">His sister Dianne Quall also was less precise than Mr Quall about the independent significance of the Danggalaba clan and the details of its laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Other persons who Mr Quall said were members of the Danggalaba clan, some of whom he described as the seniors or elders of that clan, gave evidence about the existence of the wider group comprising the first applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Their evidence did not explain with any precision the separate, independent existence of the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Nor did they regard it as the current, ultimate repository of the laws and customs of their predecessors in the Darwin area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">They did not describe the laws and customs of the Danggalaba clan as distinct from those of the first applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">... [798] There is therefore uncertainty, or inconsistency, about the composition of the Danggalaba clan and the rules governing its structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">There is also, on the evidence, no satisfactory foundation for finding that the second applicants practise and enjoy certain rights and interests which arise under laws and customs which they only have inherited from or had passed on to them by their predecessors back to sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">On the evidence, there is also no satisfactory foundation for concluding that the laws and customs reflect or derive from the normative system of the Aboriginal society which existed at sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">... ... [800] Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is a separate more confined society of Aboriginal persons comprising the second applicants who, alone among those who comprise what Mr Quall called the wider 'Larrakia language group', possess rights and interests under 'traditional' laws and customs by which they have a connection to the land and waters of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">[801] Indeed, the fact that there was a diversity of evidence about the composition and status of the Danggalaba clan, both from persons who Mr Quall claimed to be members of that clan, and from other witnesses, together with the fact that there was diversity of evidence about the laws and customs of that group compared to those of the wider group comprising the first applicants, tends to support my more general conclusions referred to below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">May 2006 --- final orders made by Mansfield J 
 
43 On 17 May 2006, about a month after he delivered his decision, Mansfield J made orders to reflect it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The relevant part of those orders were as follows:
 THE COURT ORDERS, DECLARES AND DETERMINES THAT: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Native title does not exist in relation to any part of the land or waters the subject of the applications comprising this consolidated proceeding as described in the attached Consolidated Proceeding Claim Area List.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">
 
 AND THE COURT FURTHER ORDERS THAT: 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The applications comprising this consolidated proceeding (NTD6033 of 2001) be dismissed to the extent of the consolidation as follows: 
 
 (a) in relation to proceedings ... NTD6013 of 1998 ... they are dismissed to the extent that these proceedings seek a determination of native title in relation to an area referred to in the attached Consolidated Proceeding Area List; ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">I have summarised the effect of these orders on this native title application at [2] above and I do not need to repeat that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">I should add that the southern part of the claim area in this native title application, ie the lands in Area B, are immediately to the south of the southern boundary of Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The lands in Area B are located in the Litchfield area about 20 km south-east of the Darwin CBD and about 10 km south of the Palmerston CBD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">2006/2007 - Quall applicants appeal to the Full Court --- raise Top End society case 
 
44 To complete the procedural history, both the Risk applicants and the Quall applicants appealed the decision of Mansfield J to the Full Court: (see Risk FC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The Full Court dismissed both sets of appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The main thrust of Mr Quall's appeal before the Full Court was an assertion that Mansfield J "failed to consider the substance of the case advanced by the Quall appellants at trial and by so doing did not properly identify the relevant society that was the source of the traditional laws and customs by which, at sovereignty, the Larrakia people had rights and interests in the application area" (see Risk FC at [115]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The relevant society was described to the Full Court as "the Aboriginal society in the region stretching from Cox Peninsula to West Arnhem Land", including the Larrakia people, which society was referred to variously as the 'Top End society' or 'people of the Top End'": see Risk FC at [115].</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Hereafter in these reasons, I will refer to this as 'the Top End society case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">45 The Full Court conducted a thorough review of the case Mr Quall advanced at trial ( Risk FC at [120]-[147]) and concluded that no such case was put to Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">In the process, it reviewed Mr Quall's evidence and submissions including his opening statement before Mansfield J ( Risk FC at [134]), parts of his evidence ( Risk FC at [135]-[137]), other evidence he relied upon ( Risk FC at [155]) and his oral ( Risk FC at [142]-143]) and written submissions ( Risk FC at [144]-147]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Finally, it reviewed the decision in Risk ( Risk FC at [148]-[156]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">It then reached a series of conclusions in which it soundly rejected Mr Quall's appeal ( Risk FC at [164]-[179]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">They proceeded along the following lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">46 First, the case put to Mansfield J by Mr Quall was initially based upon the traditional laws and customs at sovereignty, of the Kulumbiringin (or the Larrakia) society, and fell away to the Danggalaba clan, as follows ( Risk FC at [168]-[172]):
 [168] It is clear from the outset that the cases being put by the Quall appellants in their various applications were based upon traditional laws and customs that were the laws and customs specific to either the Kulumbiringin (or the Larrakia society at sovereignty) or the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">A fair reading of the applications would not reasonably lead the audience to which they were addressed to any other conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The Schedule F description of the traditional laws and customs in the illustrative application in the Second Supplementary Appeal Book makes no reference to any wider laws and customs or to any broader society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Attachment S to Schedule S of the application is both dense and not free from ambiguity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">It does not, in the context of what is said in the application, convey any clear contrary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">To have ascribed to it the meaning suggested in this appeal requires that it be divorced from its context and that distinctive "dictionary" meanings be given to particular terms and notably to "Aboriginal Law", though such were not given to his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">... [171] - set out at [38] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">[172] Distinctly, the two written submissions so much relied upon in support of the appeal cannot sustain the weight given them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The second of them, and probably the first as well, were filed after the conclusion of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The second, as his Honour seems to indicate, would appear to contain some degree of assertion which lacks a basis in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The Northern Territory has made a submission to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Insofar as the second submission is said to reveal Mr Quall's case on a basis different to that which we consider had been put to that point, it by no means does so unequivocally or unambiguously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">On the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">It repeatedly refers to Danggalaba Larrakia Laws and Customs --- a usage wholly consistent with one of the two bases on which the primary judge assessed the Quall appellants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">47 Secondly, Mr Quall did not put a case to Mansfield J based upon the Top End society and Mansfield J was not required to consider or make findings about such a case, ( Risk FC at [176] - set out at [38] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">48 Thirdly, and in summary, the case the Quall applicants ultimately put in Risk, ie the Danggalaba clan case, had failed for a number of independent reasons, as follows ( Risk FC at [177]):
 [177] As with the Larrakia people, it was held that the current laws and customs of the Danggalaba clan were not "traditional" in the sense required by s 223(1)(a) of the Act: [796].</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">More fundamentally, however, it was concluded (i) there was uncertainty or inconsistency about the composition of the Danggalaba clan and the rules governing its structure: [797]-[801] ; (ii) there was no satisfactory foundation for finding that the Quall appellants practise and enjoy certain rights and interests which arise under laws and customs which only they have inherited from, or have been passed on to them by, their predecessors back to sovereignty: [797]-[798]; and (iii) there was no satisfactory foundation for concluding that the Danggalaba laws and customs reflected or derived from the normative system of the Aboriginal society which existed at sovereignty: [798].</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">March 2008 - Quall applicants seek special leave to appeal to the High Court 
 
49 Mr Quall sought special leave to appeal the Full Court decision to the High Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The High Court rejected that application on 7 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">In his submissions to the High Court Mr Quall challenged the finding that the Danggalaba clan (or the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin) had ceased to follow their traditional laws and customs and re-stated his long-standing opposition to the claims of the Larrakia/Risk applicants, as reflected in the following excerpt from the High Court transcript:
 MR QUALL: Well, they got it wrong where - they stated that it was discontinued between 1937 through to 1940s, which is, you know, during the war time, and there is no government document to say that Aboriginal people had stopped continuation of practising Aboriginal laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">There is no - if there was a document that said that we did, well, you know, I would believe it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">But my family never left Darwin, they always remained in Darwin, and practising of traditional laws and customs has always taken place, and there was no strict regulations even during the time of Aboriginal people being incarcerated in Cullen Bay or other regulation that were made for Aboriginal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">They were not consistent of confining Aboriginal people to practices of traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">The evidence that I provided, all the traditional evidence that I provided was not accounted for, and our position that we were - we had no similarities with the Larrakia's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Their evidence was based on hearsay provided by the Land Council, and even - you could look at the documents of the affidavits made by the Land Council, Bill Risk and Pauline Baban who were members of the stolen generation, the evidence that we provided, that we always opposed the Larrakia claim because we had no similarities with the - on our evidence with theirs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">50 Hayne J dismissed Mr Quall's application for special leave to appeal stating that:
 The issues which the applicant, in the written submissions, sought to agitate in this Court focused largely upon whether the case which the applicant had sought to make at trial was properly understood and fully considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia examined those issues and considered that there had been no failure of the kind alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">We see no reason to doubt the correctness of those conclusions of the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The particular complaints advanced in the course of oral argument this morning focused upon the assessment of the evidence led at trial that had been made by the trial judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">In this respect, we are not persuaded that an appeal to this Court would enjoy sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">For these reasons, special leave to appeal is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">April 2008 --- the Northern Territory's strike out application - the material relied upon 
 
51 The Northern Territory filed this strike out application in April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">At the first directions hearing on 22 April 2008, I ordered Mr Quall to file and serve any affidavit material upon which he wished to rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">On 6 May 2008, Mr Quall affirmed an affidavit in which he complained that he was not able to properly present his case before Mansfield J because of a lack of resources and funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">He claimed he was not able to call the following witnesses to support his case and if he had been able to, he would have "have presented a stronger argument":
 Phillip Quall Henry Jorrack Dr Bill Day Eddy Williams 
52 Significantly, Mr Quall did not indicate what these witnesses might say, or provide any details of the case he intended to put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">More significantly still, he gave no indication that he wished to present a different case to that argued before Mansfield J --- only that he would have been able to present that case more strongly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">53 Mr Quall was represented by counsel at each of the hearings of this strike out application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">He successfully sought a number of adjournments to allow him further time to present further materials and to prepare his opposition to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">He did not file any further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">CONTENTIONS 
 The Northern Territory's submissions 
 
54 Ms Brownhill appeared on behalf of the Northern Territory and made extensive and detailed submissions which I found very helpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Ms Brownhill said the Northern Territory relied upon O 20 r 4(2) of the Federal Court Rules which she submitted applied to these proceedings because they were issued before 1 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">55 Relying upon the High Court's decision in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria and Ors [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (' Yorta Yorta' ) Ms Brownhill submitted that there were seven matters an applicant needed to establish to succeed in a native title determination application such as this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">They were as follows:
 
1. at sovereignty, there was a group of Aboriginal people having rights and interests in relation to certain land or waters;
 
2. at sovereignty, those rights and interests were possessed under an identified body of laws and customs;
 
3. at sovereignty, that body of laws and customs comprised a normative system of a particular "society" (or "community");
 
4. at sovereignty, that society was united in and by its acknowledgement and observance of the body of laws and customs;
 
5. acknowledgement and observance of the pre-sovereignty body of laws and customs has continued, substantially uninterrupted, by each generation of that society since sovereignty;
 
6. the claimants today acknowledge and observe a body of laws and customs which is substantially the same normative system as that which existed at sovereignty; and
 
7. the pre-sovereignty normative society has continued to exist throughout the period since sovereignty as a body united in and by its acknowledgement and observance of the laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">56 Ms Brownhill submitted that these matters were identified by Mansfield J in Risk at [46]-[58] and his Honour confirmed at [230] that it was necessary for the applicants to establish all of these matters to succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">She submitted that Mansfield J had reached the following relevant conclusions about these matters in his decision as follows:
 
&#8226; Points 1 to 4 --- the society of Aboriginal persons at sovereignty whose traditional laws and customs comprised a normative system under which it possessed rights and interests in the lands and waters in the claim area was the Larrakia peoples also known as the Kulumbiringin: see Risk at [232]-[233];
 
&#8226; --- there was not a separate, more confined, traditional Aboriginal society at sovereignty comprising the Danggalaba clan, within the wider Larrakia language group, that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system possessed rights and interests in the lands and waters in the Darwin area: see Risk at [796]-[801] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">
 
&#8226; Points 5 to 7 --- the current Larrakia society has not carried forth the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people such that they have had a continued existence and vitality since sovereignty: see Risk at [812], [816], [820], [823], [831], [835] and [839]; and
 
57 Ms Brownhill then took me to the claims being made by the Quall applicants before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">She submitted that this native title application (NTD6013 of 1998) is a Kulumbiringin type application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Ms Brownhill submitted that the connection between the Kulumbiringin described above, and in the eight other Kulumbiringin claims; and the two Danggalaba claims, was explained by the Full Court in Risk FC at [118] as follows:
 It is appropriate to begin with a note on nomenclature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">There are eleven native title determination applications for which Mr Quall was the named applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">In two of these the native title claim group is referred to as "members of the Danggalaba Clan".</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">In the remaining nine the group is referred to as (listed) "descendants of Kulumbiringin ancestors and constitute the Kulumbiringin according to Aboriginal law and custom".</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">As we understand it from the appellants' reply submissions, "Kulumbiringin" was the term used by the Larrakia people to describe themselves at the time of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">The significance of this community of identity will become apparent below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The word "Danggalaba" refers to a clan, or subset, of the Kulumbiringin tribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The primary judge found that, though the Larrakia had a patrilineal clan system which had ceased to exist, the Danggalaba was the one clan that continued to exist: [558].</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">In the material before us there has not been altogether consistent usage of these descriptors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Equally Mr Quall on occasions used the terms "Danggalaba Larrakia" to refer to the clan as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">58 It followed, so Ms Brownhill submitted, that the terms 'Larrakia' and 'Kulumbiringin' both refer to the Larrakia people and where Attachment S is referring to Kulumbiringin country, it is referring to the same country as Larrakia country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">She referred me to a map prepared by Tindale that was in evidence before Mansfield J which shows the country around Darwin as Larrakia country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">Further, she pointed out that all of the people named in Schedule A to this native title application were named in the wider Larrakia claim group in Risk : see Risk at [9], [10], [34] and [795].</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Indeed, as Mansfield J records in Risk at [797], they gave evidence in support of the wider Larrakia claim group and not the narrower Danggalaba claim group postulated by Mr Quall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Ms Brownhill also pointed out that the Full Court had made a number of observations to the effect that the Kulumbiringin and the Larrakia were the same people: see for example Risk FC at [156] and [176].</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">She submitted that the term 'Danggalaba' was used to describe the last remaining patrilineal clan group of the Larrakia in Risk at [488]-[490], and particularly at [558].</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">59 Ms Brownhill submitted that the claims made by Mr Quall in Attachment S to this native title application, to the effect that the Kulumbiringin were distinct from the wider Larrakia and that the former were the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty, while the latter were not, were rejected in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">In support of this submission she took me to the observations of the Full Court that Mr Quall's claim fell away before Mansfield J from one involving the Kulumbiringin tribe to a claim involving the Danggalaba Larrakia clan (see Risk FC at [176]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">She submitted that this claim was rejected by Mansfield J in Risk at [795]-[801] on the basis of an insufficiency of evidence and the Full Court confirmed as much in Risk FC at [177].</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">60 Ms Brownhill emphasised that the Top End Society identified by Mr Quall's counsel before the Full Court differed again from any of the groups mentioned above, as appears from the Full Court decision: Risk FC at [117], [121] and [157].</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">61 Ms Brownhill pointed out that the Full Court concluded that this Top End society case was not put to Mansfield J in Risk and that his Honour properly determined the case that Mr Quall did put, ie that based on Kulumbiringin laws and customs and/or Danggalaba laws and customs: Risk FC at [167] and [175]-[176].</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">62 On the principles relating to issue estoppel, Ms Brownhill referred me to the three High Court decisions of Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ; (2004) 220 CLR 363 (' Kuligowski ') at [40] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ, Ramsay v Pigram [1968] HCA 34 ; (1968) 118 CLR 271 at 276 per Barwick CJ and Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532 per Dixon J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Based on these authorities, she submitted that the findings made by Mansfield J in Risk related to the ultimate facts which founded any successful native title application and Mansfield J had made a final decision thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">63 Ms Brownhill conceded that the parties in the consolidated Risk proceedings were not identical to the parties in this native title application because the Litchfield Shire Council is a respondent in this native title application and was not a party in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">However, she submitted that the addition of this party did not affect the application of the principles of issue estoppel because the decision of Mansfield J in Risk was a decision in rem .</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">On this point Ms Brownhill referred me to a series of decisions including: PE Baker v Yehunda (1998) 15 NSWLR 437 at 442 and 446, per Hope, Samuels and McHugh JJA; Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 at [44] per Lindgren J; Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 at [65] and [70] per Flick J; Wik Peoples v Queensland [1994] FCA 967 ; (1994) 49 FCR 1 at 4 per Drummond J and WA v Ward (2000) 99 FCR 316 at [190] per Beaumont and von Doussa JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">64 The critical issues that Ms Brownhill submitted were determined in Risk and that Mr Quall is estopped from pursuing in this native title application, are as follows:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">That the Aboriginal society at sovereignty, that by the traditional laws and customs, of its normative system, possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area, inclusive of Area A, was some Aboriginal society other than the society of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples identified by Mansfield J in Risk ; and
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">That there has been no substantial interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of the laws and customs of that society of Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">65 On the principles relating to abuse of process, Ms Brownhill referred me to the decision of Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6 ) [2004] FCA 1699 (' Spalla ') at [58]-[70] per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">She submitted that the two conclusions referred to above were critical to the determination of this native title application and it would be an abuse of process to allow Mr Quall and the Quall applicants to pursue those issues in this native title application when they have already been determined against him and the Quall applicants in Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Further, Ms Brownhill submitted that it would be oppressive and unfair to allow Mr Quall and the Quall applicants to further pursue these issues; that he (and they) had been given every opportunity to present their case before Mansfield J, as the Full Court observed in Risk FC at [119] and [134]-[147]; and that this was so even though he was unrepresented during most of the hearing before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">66 In relation to Mr Quall's affidavit affirmed 6 May 2008, Ms Brownhill submitted that it was fundamentally deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">She submitted that Mr Quall had not explained why he was unable to call the four witnesses listed in that affidavit at the hearing before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Moreover she pointed out that two of the witnesses - Mr Phillip Quall and Mr Eddy Williams - were Mr Quall's brother and cousin respectively and Ms Chong-Fong's affidavit sworn on 9 May 2008, (which is before me in this strike out application), establishes that these two witnesses sat with Mr Quall in Court during parts of the hearing before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Further, Ms Brownhill submitted that it was incumbent upon Mr Quall to do more than simply assert that he could not call this evidence before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Finally, Ms Brownhill submitted that Mr Quall had not explained in his affidavit precisely what evidence he intended to call to establish this native title application and this was particularly significant since it was not specialised evidence but evidence relating to the laws and customs of the native title claim group Mr Quall represented and, therefore, evidence that was held by them alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">67 In support of her contention that it was not in the interests of justice to allow Mr Quall to pursue this native title application, Ms Brownhill submitted that:
 
(a) if this native title application were to be allowed to proceed to determination, that could result in conflicting determinations of the Court on what the normative Aboriginal society was at sovereignty; and
 
(b) it would be a waste of public funds and the resources of the Court to proceed to determine the issues raised by this native title application as to what the normative Aboriginal society was at sovereignty for the areas in and around Darwin, when so much public funding, resources, and effort have already been devoted to the same issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">68 On the question whether this native title application can possibly succeed, Ms Brownhill referred me to the High Court's decision in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 (' General Steel ') at 130; and more recently in Batistatos v Road Traffic Authority (NSW) [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 226 CLR 256 (' Batistatos ') at [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Based on those authorities, she submitted that Mr Quall could not possibly succeed in this native title claim because the conclusions of Mansfield J in Risk on the seven matters set out above (at [55]), which are fundamental to a successful native title application, necessarily meant that he could not possibly succeed here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Mr Quall's submissions 
 
69 During the earlier stages of this strike out application, Mr Quall was represented by Mr Matthews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">During the course of the various adjournments of the hearing of the application, Mr Quall changed solicitors and at the final day's hearing he was represented by Mr Loizou.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Mr Loizou began by submitting that Mr Quall represented the Danggalaba clan group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">He submitted that this was a core group made up of the Batcho family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">He submitted that the Kulumbiringin is the tribal name incorporating the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Kulumbiringin as the tribal name is to be distinguished from the Larrakia/Risk applicants' use of the term 'Kulumbiringin'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Mr Loizou submitted that Mansfield J's findings and conclusions in Risk did not apply to Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Therefore, so he submitted, no issue estoppel arose from the decision in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">As I understood his submissions to this point, Mr Quall's counsel was describing the Danggalaba clan and/or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case the Quall applicants put in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">However, after a short adjournment, Mr Loizou then submitted that the case described by Mr Quall's counsel before the Full Court at Risk FC [120]-[132] and summarised at Risk FC [161]-[163], is the case Mr Quall now wished to pursue in this native title application, ie the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">He submitted that the Full Court rejected this case saying that it had not been raised before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">He said that Mr Quall had explained in his affidavit that the reason why this Top End society case was not properly raised before Mansfield J was his lack of resources and his inability as an unrepresented party to properly present that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Therefore, Mr Loizou submitted, Mansfield J had not determined this Top End society case in Risk and since it had not been determined there, nothing that his Honour decided in Risk could operate as an issue estoppel to prevent him raising this case in relation to Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">So, at the completion of his submissions, Mr Loizou put the case on two alternative bases: the Danggalaba clan and/or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case and the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Finally, Mr Loizou submitted that any summary dismissal of proceedings before a court should be approached with extreme caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The Northern Territory's submissions in reply 
 
70 In reply, Ms Brownhill submitted that the Full Court had concluded that while Mr Quall was unrepresented he had participated fully in the hearing before Mansfield J and there was nothing to suggest that he was affected by any lack of resources in presenting his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Even if he was, Ms Brownhill submitted, there is nothing in Mr Quall's affidavit to suggest that the situation will be any different in relation to his presentation of the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Finally, Ms Brownhill submitted that Mr Quall had clearly put a case before Mansfield J that at sovereignty the traditional Aboriginal society was the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples, later narrowed to the Danggalaba/Larrakia clan, and he should not be permitted, in the interests of justice, to put an entirely different case in relation to Area B, ie the Top End society case identified by his counsel before the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">THE ISSUES THAT ARISE IN THIS STRIKE OUT APPLICATION 
 
71 From the contentions of the parties set out above, the following are the issues I consider have been raised for determination in this strike out application:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Does the decision in Risk give rise to an issue estoppel to prevent the Quall applicants pursuing this native title application?</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Because of the dichotomous approach adopted by Mr Quall's counsel and the differing issues that arise as a consequence, I consider I need to approach this issue on the basis that the Quall applicants wish, in this native title application, to pursue:
 
(a) a Danggalaba clan or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case; and/or
 
(b) a Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">If no issue estoppel arises in relation to either or both of the cases identified above, would it constitute an abuse of process for the Quall applicants to pursue either, or both, of these cases in this native title application?</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Does the decision in Risk mean that the Quall applicants have no reasonable prospects of success in this native title application?</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Again, I consider this issue has to be approached on the two alternative cases set out in 1. above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">If an issue estoppel arises, or the abuse of process exists, or this native title application has no reasonable prospects of success, does that warrant this native title application being struck out?</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">72 In considering these issues, I will deal first with the principles relating to strike out applications, or the summary dismissal of court proceedings, and then deal with the issues of issue estoppel, abuse of process and no reasonable prospects of success in that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">CONSIDERATION 
 The principles applicable to strike out applications 
 
73 The principles that apply to the summary dismissal of court proceedings are well established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">They apply equally to an application such as this to summarily dismiss a native title determination application under s 61 of the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">They are conveniently summarised in Edward Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 at [7] , per Mansfield J, as follows:
 Whichever power is relied upon on the motion, it is accepted that the principles applicable to consideration of a summary dismissal application should be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">The Court should only dismiss the application if the case for its dismissal is very clear: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Consequently, the power summarily to dismiss an application should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable, and upon the version of the evidence favourable to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The Court should not, upon such an application, generally undertake any weighing of conflicting evidence or of the inferences which might be drawn from such evidence: Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">See also: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 , at [48]-[49], per Lander J, North and Dowsett JJ agreeing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">In Batistatos , in the joint decision of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ, their Honours observed that the statements in General Steel should not be given "canonical force" and they referred to Agar v Hyde (2000) 201 CLR 522 at [57], where it was observed that the various formulae used in General Steel and Dey , was intended to describe "a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome".</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">74 It follows that I must be satisfied to a high degree of certainty that because of an issue estoppel, an abuse of process, or no reasonable prospects of success, this native title application is plainly untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">In the process, I must take "exceptional caution" to ensure that Mr Quall and the Quall applicants are not deprived of the right to submit a real and genuine controversy for determination, which has not yet been fully and finally determined on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Furthermore, I should approach this strike out application on the version of any evidence that is favourable to Mr Quall and the Quall applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Does the decision in Risk give rise to an issue estoppel for the Quall applicants?</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">
 
75 Before turning to the alternative cases identified in submissions by Mr Quall's counsel, it is convenient to consider the principles in relation to issue estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Issue estoppel is a principle that was developed from estoppel per rem judicatam in approximately the middle of the last century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">It is distinguishable from estoppel by res judicata , also known as estoppel by record, or cause of action estoppel which, as the last clearly implies, applies to causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Issue estoppel applies to matters of law or fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">It is based upon public policy in the finality of litigation and private justice considerations that a person should not be "twice vexed for one and the same cause": see Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung v Rayner and Keeler Ltd &amp; Ors (No 2) (' Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung ') (1966) 2 All ER 536 at 549-550, 564-565 and Spencer Bower and Turner Res judicata 2 nd Ed, at 10-11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">76 Issue estoppel applies where: (i) the same question or issue has been decided; (ii) by a final judicial decision; (iii) between the parties to that judicial decision or their privies who are the same parties in the proceedings where the estoppel is raised: see Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung at 564, Ramsay v Pigram (1968) 181 CLR 271 at 276 per Barwick CJ and Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at [21] and [40].</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">77 Applying these principles to the present case, there can be no doubt, in my view, that the second prerequisite for issue estoppel has been met because the decision of Mansfield J in Risk was clearly a final judicial decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">78 As to the third prerequisite for issue estoppel, the parties to this native title application are relevantly the same as the parties in Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">I have used the word 'relevantly' because I do not consider the addition of the Litchfield Shire Council as a respondent to this native title application is relevant to the question whether issue estoppel applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It would be so if the Litchfield Shire Council were attempting to make out an issue estoppel based upon the decision in Risk , but that is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">For the same reason, I do not consider the fact that there were other parties in the consolidated proceedings in Risk who are not parties to this native title application, prevents issue estoppel applying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">In my view, the relevant consideration is whether the parties who are opposed on the issues putatively affected by issue estoppel (or their privies), are common to both sets of proceedings, not whether all the parties are identical in both sets of proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Here, the same parties who agitated the issues in Risk are seeking to agitate similar issues --- I will not foreclose on the first prerequisite (above) at this stage by describing them as the same issues - in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Those parties are, of course, Mr Quall as the authorised applicant on behalf of the Quall applicants and the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">It follows, in my view, that the third prerequisite for issue estoppel has been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Having reached this conclusion, I do not need to consider the Northern Territory's submission that the addition of the Litchfield Shire Council as a party to this native title application is overcome by the fact that the decision of Mansfield J in Risk is a determination in rem .</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">79 That leaves for consideration the first prerequisite for issue estoppel (above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">In considering that prerequisite, it is necessary to compare the relevant issues that were decided in Risk with the issues raised in this native title application on the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">80 I have set out at [41]-[42] above, the critical issues that I consider were decided in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">They can be summarised as follows:
 
 
 
 a) the Larrakia peoples comprised the Aboriginal society at sovereignty that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area, including Area A;
 b) there has been a substantial interruption in the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia peoples since sovereignty such that native title does not now exist for the lands and waters in Area A; and
 c) there was not a separate, more confined, Aboriginal society at sovereignty that by its traditional laws and customs had rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area, comprising the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">
 
 

Mansfield J decided these critical issues in accordance with the principles explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta , which are clearly delineated in his Honour's decision and accurately summarised in Ms Brownhill's submissions (see [55]-[56] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">I should add that I also agree with Ms Brownhill's submission (see [58] above), that in this context, the terms 'Larrakia' and 'Kulumbiringin' both refer to the Larrakia peoples and Larrakia land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">81 With one addition, I therefore consider that Ms Brownhill has also accurately summarised the critical issues that were determined in Risk and which Mr Quall is estopped from pursuing in this native title application, as follows (see [64] above):
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">That the Aboriginal society at sovereignty, that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system, possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area, inclusive of Area A, was some Aboriginal society other than the society of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples identified by Mansfield J in Risk ; and
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">That there has been no substantial interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of the laws and customs of that society of Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The addition I have mentioned above is that I also consider Mr Quall is estopped from claiming in this native title application that: there was a separate, more confined, traditional Aboriginal society at sovereignty comprising the Danggalaba clan that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system, possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">1(a) issue estoppel and the Danggalaba Clan case or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case 
 
82 Turning then to the first of the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel, ie the Danggalaba clan case and/or the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, for the reasons set out below, I consider the issues raised in this native title application in relation to both of these cases are identical to those that were determined in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">83 First, the form of this native title application is identical to the form in which it was as part of the consolidated proceedings in Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">It is also in the same form as the other eight Kulumbiringin type native title applications that were pursued by Mr Quall in Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">No amendments were made to this native title application while it was a part of the consolidated proceedings in Risk and no amendments have been made to it since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">The critical issues raised in this native title application are, therefore, exactly the same as those raised in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Those issues are recorded at [37] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">84 The Full Court provided an apt summary of the cases Mr Quall put to Mansfield J in Risk: see Risk FC at [168].</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">That summary is set out at [46] above, but it bears repeating as follows:
 [168] It is clear from the outset that the cases being put by the Quall appellants in their various applications were based upon traditional laws and customs that were the laws and customs specific to either the Kulumbiringin (or the Larrakia society at sovereignty) or the Danggalaba clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">A fair reading of the applications would not reasonably lead the audience to which they were addressed to any other conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The Schedule F description of the traditional laws and customs in the illustrative application in the Second Supplementary Appeal Book makes no reference to any wider laws and customs or to any broader society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">... 
85 It follows, that the critical questions raised by the competing native title applications of the Quall applicants and the Risk applicants in Risk and which are also raised in identical form by this native title application are: what was the Aboriginal society at sovereignty, that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system, possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area (for ease of reference, I will refer to this society henceforth in these reasons as 'the relevant Aboriginal society') --- was it the Larrakia society described by the Risk applicants, or the Danggalaba clan and/or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin as described by the Quall applicants?</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">86 Finally, in deciding whether the same issues are raised for determination in this native title application, that were raised and determined in Risk, I consider it is also significant that the lands the subject to this native title application and all the other Quall native title applications in Risk , have been described in the same, or similar, form throughout, ie variously, as the Larrakia or Kulumbiringin lands or country (see [17(b)] above - for ease of reference, I will refer to these lands henceforth in these reasons as 'Larrakia lands').</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">This was so throughout all the various amendments to this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">It was also so before and after the splitting of the various native title applications into those that applied to Areas A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">In that respect, I do not consider that the splitting of the native title applications into two areas changed the character of the lands that were the subject of this native title application or, indeed, any of the other native title applications involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">That splitting was done to meet the convenience of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">It was not done to draw any distinction between the lands in Area A or B in relation to whether they were Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Thus, all of the lands in both Areas A and B still remained Larrakia lands in relation to which the Quall applicants asserted they held native title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Finally, it should be noted, that Mr Quall (or his counsel) referred to these lands as Larrakia lands or country repeatedly in Risk and Risk FC : see Risk FC at [137], [140] and [161]-[162].</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">For these reasons, I do not accept Mr Loizou's submission that the findings of Mansfield J in Risk can be distinguished because they only applied to Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">87 In my view, therefore, the issues raised in this native title application are identical to the issues that were raised and determined by Mansfield J in Risk as summarised above (at [80]-[81]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">In other words, the questions I have identified at [85] above as having been raised by this native title application are answered in my summary of the findings of Mansfield J in Risk at [80] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">88 Before leaving this issue, I should add that I do not consider that Mr Quall's change of position from the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case back to the Danggalaba clan case during the final stages of the hearing in Risk affects this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">That is so because Mansfield J ultimately found against the Quall applicants on both these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">On the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, Mansfield J found that the society of the Larrakia peoples (which included the Quall applicants' Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case: see Risk at [96]), was the relevant Aboriginal society had interests in Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">In making this finding, his Honour did not distinguish between the cases put by the Risk applicants and the Quall applicants, so both groups can claim some measure of success, even though this joint success runs contrary to one of the Quall applicants' primary claims that the Risk applicants had lost their culture and was simply a language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">However, his Honour also found that since sovereignty, there had been a substantial interruption in the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia, as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta , such that no native title presently existed in relation to those lands and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">This latter finding simultaneously disposed of both the Risk applicants' and the Quall applicants' Larrakia/Kulumbiringin cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Furthermore, Mansfield J found that the Quall applicants had failed to establish the Danggalaba clan case, by finding that there was not a separate, more confined, Aboriginal society at sovereignty, comprising of the Danggalaba clan that by its traditional laws and customs possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">89 I therefore conclude that all the prerequisites for an issue estoppel are present in relation to the first of the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel and together they dictate that the decision in Risk gave rise to an issue estoppel to prevent the Quall applicants raising for determination in this native title application, the Danggalaba clan case and/or the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary for me to consider the other issues that have been raised in relation to the alternative cases, ie issues 2 and 3 set out in [71] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">1 (b) Issue estoppel and the Top End society case 
 
90 That brings me to the second of the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel, ie the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">At the outset, I should record that despite it being outlined by Mr Quall's then counsel in submissions before the Full Court, it remains the fact that the Top End society case, as so described, is not mentioned anywhere in the various iterations of this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">Mr Quall's counsel's answer to a related concern I had with the issues raised in this native title application, when I raised that concern with him at one of the earlier stages of this strike out application, was to propose that I should allow the Quall applicants an opportunity to properly state the case they wished to put in this native title application and then consider whether it should be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">To my mind, there were some obvious problems with that proposal, not the least being delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">These proceedings have now been on foot for about 12 years; the Full Court hearing when this Top End society case was first identified by Mr Quall's then counsel, occurred some two years ago; and this strike out application had been on foot for about three months when this problem first arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Yet, in all that time, no attempt has been made by Mr Quall, or his legal advisors, to include the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">91 Nonetheless, if Mr Quall were to be given this opportunity to properly describe the Top End society case in this native title application, it is not difficult to predict that it will be described in much the same terms as it was by his then counsel before the Full Court: see [92] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">If so, given that the summary of the Top End society case before the Full Court was quite detailed, there would appear to be little to be gained by yet further delay in these proceedings while Mr Quall's legal advisers include that description in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">I will therefore proceed to consider that case as if it were included in that form in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">92 The Top End society case was described by Mr Quall's then counsel to the Full Court (see Risk FC at [120]-[132]), and summarised by the Full Court, (see Risk FC at [161]-[162]), as follows (emphasis added):
 [161] As to the claimed existence of a wider Top End society at sovereignty, it is submitted the evidence established that (a) the land around the settlement of Palmerston on Port Darwin was occupied by the Larrakia and recognised as Larrakia country; (b) there were other "tribes" occupying neighbouring land, in the areas delineated on the Tindale map; (c) there were dreaming tracks that link the land occupied by the different "tribes" in the region; (d) the creation myths of the Larrakia (and other tribes) accounted for the relationship to the land of their own tribe and that of others in the region; (e) the "tribes" in the region visited each other and participated in shared ceremonies, including ceremonies relating to initiation of young men and death rituals; (f) some of the customs and rituals involved the use of items such as human hair and fat from dead human bodies that were shared or traded between tribes; (g) these tribes intermarried with each other and observed rules in relation to the tribal affiliation of the children of such inter- marriages; (h) there were rules which regulated the response of one tribe to a murder of one of their members by a member of another tribe (and also regulated the response to that response); (i) the tribes knew of and acknowledged each others' land boundaries; (j) members of one tribe were prohibited from entering the land belonging to another tribe or from removing anything from that land without the permission of the owners; (k) in ordinary circumstances members of the tribe had the right to roam over and use the resources of the whole of the land belonging to the tribe without asking permission; (l) within the tribal lands sub-groups or clans owned their own portions and members of one group were not permitted to enter the camp of another group without a formal invitation; (m) there was a system whereby messengers bearing recognised objects could be sent out to the territory of other tribes in safety with messages/invitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">[162] Taken together, it is said, this evidence unequivocally establishes the existence of a wider "society" of Top End Aboriginal tribes with traditional laws and customs regulating their interactions, their shared religious and ceremonial life, and, crucially for present purposes, their rights and interests in land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">It also establishes that that society was the source of the normative system which gave rise to the right of the Larrakia people to ownership of Larrakia land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">For reasons we give below, we have not considered it necessary to enter upon the evidence supporting the above assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">93 As can be seen from the Full Court's summary, this case is founded on the proposition that the relevant traditional Aboriginal society possessed of the rights and interests in Larrakia lands was a wider society "of Top End Aboriginal tribes", described by the Full Court as the "Top End society" case: (see Risk FC at [116]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">94 In summary, the Full Court rejected this case for the following reasons:
 
(a) no such case was put to Mansfield J: Risk FC at [176];
 
(b) instead the case that Mr Quall ultimately put to Mansfield J was based on the laws and customs of the Danggalaba Larrakia clan, it having fallen away from a case based on the laws and customs of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples: Risk FC at [176]; and
 
(c) Mansfield J properly considered, and rightly rejected, the case that was ultimately put to him on four bases, as follows ( Risk FC at [177]):
 
 
 (i) the current laws and customs of the Danggalaba clan were not "traditional" in the sense required by s 223(1)(a) of the NT Act: Risk at [796];
 (ii) there was uncertainty or inconsistency about the composition of the Danggalaba clan and the rules governing its structure: Risk at [797]-[801];
 (iii) there was no satisfactory foundation for finding that the Quall [applicants] practice and enjoy certain rights and interests which arise under laws and customs which only they have inherited from, or have been passed on to them by, their predecessors back to sovereignty: Risk at [797]-[798]; and
 (iv) there was no satisfactory foundation for concluding that the Danggalaba laws and customs reflected or were derived from the normative system of the Aboriginal society which existed at sovereignty: Risk at [798].</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">
 

95 It is obvious from these conclusions that the Full Court would not have been willing to allow Mr Quall to raise this Top End society case for the first time on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Given the difficulties inherent in that approach, that probably explains why Mr Quall's counsel argued instead before the Full Court that the case had already been put to Mansfield J and his Honour had failed to consider it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">As appears above, Mr Quall's counsel failed in that attempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">Not daunted by that failure, Mr Quall now wishes to adopt this Top End society case, as the Quall applicants' case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">96 Mr Loizou submitted that the Top End society case was not determined by Mansfield J in Risk (see [69] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">At the superficial level, that is clearly so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">However, I consider that submission states the matter at too high a level of generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">In any native title determination application under s 61 of the NT Act, such as this, the ultimate object or goal is to obtain a determination of native title in favour of the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">To do that, the claimant group, in this case the Quall applicants, would have to persuade the Court that the Top End society meets the various components of the definition of native title in s 223 of the NT Act, as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Stated in this way, it can be seen that the object or goal the Quall applicants hope to achieve by pursuing the Top End society case in this native title application, is to answer the question identified in [85] above - what was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty that possessed rights and interests in Larrakia lands in Area B --- with the answer: the Top End society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">97 Properly analysed in this way, what the Quall applicants are seeking to do by raising the Top End society case is to proffer a further alternative society to the three societies that were proffered, variously, by the Risk applicants and the Quall applicants in Risk (see [86] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">It follows, in my view, that while the Top End society case is self-evidently different in itself, and the components of that society were not considered or determined in Risk , the critical issue raised by that case is the same as that raised and determined in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">98 I would add that, as with the first of the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel, ie the Danggalaba clan case (see [86] above), I do not consider it matters that this native title application now relates to Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">This is so because all of the lands in both Areas A and B are clearly Larrakia lands and the relevant Aboriginal society possessing rights and interests in those lands will be the same for both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">99 For these reasons, I consider that the first prerequisite for issue estoppel is met in relation to the second of the alternative cases identified by Mr Quall's counsel, ie the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">That being so, I conclude that all of the prerequisites for an issue estoppel are present in relation to that second alternative case and together they dictate that the decision in Risk gave rise to an issue estoppel to prevent the Quall applicants pursuing the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">However, in case I am wrong in this conclusion, particularly as to the first prerequisite for issue estoppel, I consider it is appropriate for me to consider the second issue identified above (at [71]), ie whether it would constitute an abuse of process for the Quall applicants to now pursue the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Does pursuing the Top End society case constitute an abuse of process?</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">
 
100 First, it is convenient to identify the relevant principles on abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">The concept of abuse of process is founded on the same underlying concerns as res judicata and issue estoppel, viz the concern a person should not be troubled twice for the same cause and public policy concerns in the finality of litigation: see Spalla at [64] and [67] per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">However, the concept is not limited by reference to those doctrines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Thus, even though the earlier proceedings did not give rise to a res judicata or an issue estoppel, eg because the parties or their privies to the two sets of proceedings were not the same, an attempt to re-litigate an issue that has already been disposed of in other proceedings, may constitute an abuse of process: see Sea Culture International Pty Ltd v Scoles [1991] FCA 523 ; (1991) 32 FCR 275 (' Sea Culture ') at 279 per French J, Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 (' Walton ') at 393-394 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 at [25] per von Doussa, Branson and Sundberg JJ, Spalla at [66]-[67] per French J and Brock v Minister for Home Affairs [2008] FCAFC 165 at [74] per Lindgren and Tracey JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">101 The Court is empowered under O 20 r 4 to stay or dismiss a proceeding where it is considered to be an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">However, as with the summary dismissal of court proceedings in general, this power is to be exercised very sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances: see Sea Culture at 279 per French J and Djaigween v Douglas [1994] FCA 951 ; (1994) 48 FCR 535 at 545 per Carr J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The circumstances in which abuse of process may arise are "extremely varied" and are not limited to "fixed categories": see Rogers v R [1994] HCA 42 ; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 255 per Mason CJ, Sea Culture at 279 per French J, Spalla at [63] and Batistatos at [15] and [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Thus, the concept of abuse of process may extend to prevent the waste of judicial resources and include, as a consideration, the necessity of maintaining confidence in, and respect for, the authority of the courts: see Spalla at [69] per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">So, too, an attempt to litigate an issue that ought reasonably to have been litigated in earlier proceedings: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 and Spalla at [59].</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">Finally, the concept may apply to allow proceedings to be struck out that can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail: see Walton at 393 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">102 In State Bank of NSW v Stenhouse (1997) Australian Torts Reports 81-423 at 64,098, Giles CJ emphasised the importance of the particular circumstances that apply in determining whether it is an abuse of process to re-litigate an issue in subsequent proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">His Honour set out a non-exhaustive list of matters relevant to the determination whether an abuse of process was occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">This non-exhaustive list of matters was adopted by French J in Spalla at [70].</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">The non-exhaustive list is as follows:
 (a) the importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceedings, including whether it is an evidentiary issue or an ultimate issue; (b) the opportunity available and taken to fully litigate the issue; (c) the terms and finality of the finding as to the issue; (d) the identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings; (e) any plea of fresh evidence, including the nature and significance of the evidence and the reason why it was not part of the earlier proceedings; all part of - (f) the extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue is relitigated and the impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice; and (g) an overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuser against the matters supportive of abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">103 Before considering these matters, as they apply to this case, I should first restate the critical issue I consider the Quall applicants are seeking to raise in this native title application by pursuing the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">As stated above at [96], in my view, that issue is whether the Top End society was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty, that possessed rights and interests in Larrakia lands in Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">As noted above (at [96]), it follows that the Quall applicants wish to add a further alternative society to the three Aboriginal societies that were proffered in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">I will now turn to consider that issue by reference to the non-exhaustive list of matters set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">(a) The importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceedings, including whether it is an evidentiary issue or an ultimate issue 
 
104 This first matter requires a consideration of what constitutes an ultimate issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">In my view, an ultimate issue is one that forms the ingredients of the cause of action in a proceeding, or the "title to the right established".</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">It encapsulates the actual ground upon which the existence of any right in the proceedings was negatived, or any point which was necessary to decide and was actually decided as a part of the ground work of the decision itself: see Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1930) 62 CLR 464 (' Blair v Curran ') at 532-533 per Dixon J and Kuligowski at [60]-[62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">105 Thus, the question raised by this first matter is whether the issue the Quall applicants are seeking to raise by pursuing the Top End society case (described above), was an important issue in Risk and one that was part of the ground work upon which Mansfield J concluded that native title did not exist in area A of the Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">In my view, that is clearly so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">106 In Risk , Mansfield J ultimately held that native title did not exist for the Larrakia lands and waters in Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">That ultimate conclusion depended upon his Honour's application of the definition of native title in s 233 of the NT Act, as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta , to the facts as disclosed by the evidence before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">After undertaking that process, Mansfield J made two critical findings which I have already set out above (see [41]-[42] and summarised by [80]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Each of these findings was, in my view, a crucial part of the ground work for the ultimate conclusion made by Mansfield J that native title did not exist in Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Therefore, in my view, each of these findings was an ultimate issue as defined by Dixon J in Blair v Curran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">Furthermore, I consider that each of these findings was of paramount importance in Risk because they were fundamental to that ultimate conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">(b) The opportunity available and taken to fully litigate the issue in the earlier proceedings 
 
107 There can be little doubt, in my view, that Mr Quall and the Quall applicants had every opportunity to fully litigate the issue as to what was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in the Larrakia lands in Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">The Quall applicants became the second applicants in Risk and therefore were a party to the consolidated proceedings in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">Indeed, one of the main purposes of s 67 of the NT Act is to require that all claims over the same area are dealt with together in the same proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Having become a party, the nature and extent of Mr Quall's participation in the hearing in Risk was summarised by the Full Court as follows ( Risk FC at [119]):
 It is important to emphasise that Mr Quall was not represented at the hearing before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">Nonetheless, as his Honour indicated ([34] and [798]), he gave evidence (albeit of "relatively short compass"); he tendered some documents, though these did not include an anthropological report prepared for the proceedings; he cross-examined witnesses; and he made submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">His Honour noted (at [797]) that his evidence was, in effect, the only evidence directly supporting his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">108 After the decision in Risk , the Quall applicants took the opportunity to appeal that decision to the Full Court (see [44]-[48] above) and then took the opportunity to seek special leave to appeal to the High Court (see [49]-[50] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">Mr Quall and the Quall applicants have therefore taken the opportunity to pursue their case/s at every level of the federal courts system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">109 However, notwithstanding these opportunities, Mr Quall has claimed before me that his ability to present his case in Risk was hampered because he was not legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">As the procedural history to this native title claim (above) demonstrates, Mr Quall has complained about this situation often in the past and he has levelled criticisms at the Northern Land Council for not providing his group of applicants with the funding necessary to obtain legal representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">In his affidavit affirmed on 6 May 2008, Mr Quall repeated those complaints saying (at paragraph 4): "I was restricted in presenting evidence and legal argument due to a lack of resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">I was unable to obtain financial assistance from the Northern Land Council ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">He went on to claim that his ability to present his case in Risk was "significantly affected", that he was "not able to adequately present evidence" and that if he had been able to, he "would have presented a stronger argument".</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">110 Notwithstanding these complaints, I consider the record shows that Mr Quall, and the Quall applicants, were able to fully litigate the issue as to what was relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">The most obvious indication of this is that both the Quall applicants and the Risk applicants were jointly successful in establishing that the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing those rights and interests was the Larrakia peoples (see [80] and [88] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Furthermore, the aspect upon which this native title application failed in the consolidated proceedings in Risk , ie a substantial interruption in the continuous acknowledgement and observance of the laws and customs of the Larrakia peoples since sovereignty, was a joint failure with the Risk and Quall applicants (see [80] and [88] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">In this respect, I consider it is significant that the Risk applicants were legally represented and assisted by the NLC throughout, so this joint failure occurred notwithstanding that the Risk applicants were legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">111 The other area of failure for the Quall applicants was the rejection by Mansfield J of their claim that the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin society did not include the Risk applicants and was limited to the Danggalaba clan (originally the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case), comprised of the Quall applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">In my view, this failure on the part of the Quall applicants was secondary to the joint success and joint failure described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Moreover, it is debatable, in my view, whether the Quall applicants' failure to establish the Danggalaba clan case was due to a lack of legal representation, or due to a fundamental defect in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">112 As to the latter, I consider it is significant that the Danggalaba clan case put forward by Mr Quall and the Quall applicants had already failed in the Kenbi Land Claim, albeit in a different statutory regime (see [12]-[14] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Furthermore, one of the native title applications lodged by Mr Quall and the Quall applicants, based upon the Danggalaba clan, had already been dismissed in Quall because O'Loughlin J found that Mr Quall could not adequately identify what the Danggalaba clan was (see [19]-[30] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Finally, Mr Quall himself changed from the Danggalaba clan case to the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, in October 2001, and then changed back to the Danggalaba clan case, during final submissions in Risk in 2004, after four witnesses he called in support of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, failed to give evidence in support of that case (see [38] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">The description of this event by Mansfield J in Risk at [797] (see [42] above) and by the Full Court in Risk FC at [176] (see [47] above), suggests that Mr Quall, and perhaps his sister, ended up being the only ones supporting the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, and that all the other members of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin, including the witnesses Mr Quall had called, supported the Risk applicants about the identity of the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in Larrakia land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">113 Next, I consider it is significant that despite his lack of legal representation during the course of these proceedings, Mr Quall was able to produce a detailed description of his Danggalaba clan case in this native title application, ie the May 2000 amendments (see [6]-[10] and [14]-[17] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">He was then able to produce a detailed description of his Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case in this native title application, at the time of the October 2001 amendments (see [33]-[37] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">In both these versions, Attachment S contained detailed references to the writings of historians and anthropologists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">In my view, these documents demonstrate that Mr Quall and the Quall applicants were able, despite their lack of legal representation, to outline what their case was and to make considered decisions as to what form their case should take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Against this demonstrated capacity, it is significant, in my view, that the Top End society case was not ever raised before Mansfield J, as the Full Court found in Risk FC (see [46] above), and has not ever been raised in this native title application by way of amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">114 Finally, on this aspect, given that Mr Quall and the Quall applicants were able to outline these two alternative cases in Risk , and given that no explanation has been provided in Mr Quall's affidavit or elsewhere as to why the Top End society case was not put to Mansfield J in Risk , it is open to be inferred that Mr Quall and the Quall applicants made a deliberate decision not to pursue that case before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">This inference may be further supported by the fact that the statements in Mr Quall's affidavit of 6 May 2008, all appear to be directed to presenting a stronger argument in relation to the Danggalaba clan or Larrakia/Kulumbiringin cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">However, I am mindful of the requirement in a strike out application such as this to approach it on the version of the evidence most favourable to Mr Quall and the Quall applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">Nonetheless, that becomes quite difficult when I am confronted with a lack of evidence on an important question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">In this respect, it is worth stating that the detailed knowledge of the components of a successful native title determination, particularly the details of the traditional laws and customs of the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty, all rests with the Aboriginal people concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">In this case, the detailed knowledge about the components of the Top End society rests with the Quall applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">These are not matters upon which anthropologists can give primary evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">What they can do is to express opinions based upon the primary evidence of the Aboriginal people concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Here, Mr Quall and the Quall applicants have not produced any evidence of the details of the Top End society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">They have not even produced the most basic level of evidence, eg an affidavit by Mr Quall, or another member of the Quall applicant group, stating that the matters summarised by the Full Court (see Risk FC at [161]-[162] at [92] above), about the Top End society, correctly and accurately described it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">(c) The terms and finality of the finding as to the issue in the earlier proceedings 
 
115 As I have already observed above, I consider the findings made by Mansfield J in Risk are in clear terms and they deal directly with the various components of the definition of native title in s 233 of the NT Act, as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">Those findings followed an exhaustive examination of a large body of evidence and they resulted in the final orders made by Mansfield J to the effect that native title does not exist for Larrakia lands in Area A (see [43] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">In my view, the findings and orders of Mansfield J are final, in the sense that they foreclose on any other Aboriginal society being able to establish that the laws and customs under its normative system gave rise to rights and interests in Larrakia lands in Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Indeed, they constitute a judgment in rem that no native title exists in those lands (see the cases set out in [63] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">While the decision in Risk does not have the same status in relation to the lands in Area B, I do not consider that detracts from the final effect of the findings on the ultimate issues upon which that decision is founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Specifically, that the Larrakia peoples were the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty that possessed rights and interests in Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">I consider this constitutes a final finding as to the relevant Aboriginal society that possessed rights and interests in those lands whether they fell within Area A or B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">(d) The identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings 
 
116 I have already concluded above (see [97]), that the critical issue raised by the Top End society case is the same as that that was raised and determined in Risk , ie what was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty that possessed rights and interests in Larrakia lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">I have decided to consider whether it would be an abuse of process to pursue the Top End society case in this native title application on the basis that I may be wrong in that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">However, if I am wrong about the two issues being the same, I consider that the two issues are so similar that whilst they may not support an issue estoppel, they are, in my view, clearly sufficiently similar for the purposes of abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">(e) Any plea of fresh evidence including the nature and significance of the evidence and reason why it was not part of the earlier proceedings 
 
117 There is no plea of fresh evidence put by the Quall applicants in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Instead, Mr Quall has complained in his affidavit of 6 May 2008, that because he was not legally represented, he was not able to call witnesses and present his case properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">I have already dealt with some aspects of this issue in [114] above and I will not repeat those observations here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">However, I have not dealt with this complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Specifically, Mr Quall has complained that there were four witnesses that he said he wished to call to give evidence before Mansfield J and he was not able to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">However, it emerged from the affidavit of Ms Chong-Fong that two of these four witnesses sat beside Mr Quall during parts of the hearing in Risk before Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">I consider this evidence from Ms Chong-Fong required an explanation from Mr Quall as to why he did not call at least these two witnesses in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">As with the evidence about the details of the Top End society, this evidence is held by Mr Quall alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">No such explanation was forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Furthermore, there is no indication in Mr Quall's affidavit as to what evidence these four witnesses could give.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">It is therefore impossible to assess whether or not their evidence would have had any impact on the outcome in Risk and/or go to establish the Top End society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">As well, as noted above (see [114]), Mr Quall has not given any explanation in his affidavit as to why the Top End society case was not pursued in Risk .</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">As I have also noted above (at [114]), it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to approach this strike out application on the version of the evidence most favourable to Mr Quall, when he has not put the necessary evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">So, even if I approach the evidence in that way, I am still left with significant gaps in the evidence that tell against Mr Quall and the Quall applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">(f) The extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue is relitigated and impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice 
 
118 I consider that it would be contrary to both the finality of litigation principle and promoting public confidence in the administration of justice, if Mr Quall and the Quall applicants were to be allowed to pursue this Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">In reaching this view in relation to the finality of litigation principle, I take into account the fact that Mansfield J conducted a lengthy hearing in Risk, including receiving detailed submissions and evidence from numerous witnesses, including Mr Quall himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">That whole process took many years and would have cost many millions of dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">After the decision of Justice Mansfield was delivered, Mr Quall appealed to the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">It conducted a thorough review of all the materials before Mansfield J and concluded that Mr Quall had not raised the Top End society case before Mansfield J and had not established either his Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, or the narrowed down version of the Danggalaba clan case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Mr Quall then unsuccessfully sought special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">Thus far, Mr Quall has therefore used every level of the federal courts system to pursue his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">At some point, there must be an end to this litigation and I consider it has now been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">119 In reaching this view in relation to the promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice, I take into account the just and efficient allocation of the Court's resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">In that respect, I am mindful of the fact that there are many other native title applicant groups waiting in the Court's native title list to have their native title determination applications determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">As at 30 September 2008, there were 527 native title determination applications outstanding nationally, 160 of those in the Northern Territory Registry of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">I fully appreciate that there are many reasons why this situation exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">However, I consider that it is in the interest of the administration of justice, so far as this Court has any control over the matter, that I ensure that the Court's resources are devoted to the resolution of real and genuine native title determination applications that have not yet been provided with a determination on their merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">Finally, I consider that it would not be in the interests of promoting public confidence in the administration of justice to create a situation where this Court could make conflicting determinations as to what the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty was for Larrakia lands, between the Larrakia peoples as found in Risk and the Top End society as now sought to be proffered by the Quall applicants in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">(g) An overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuse or against the matters supportive of abuse of process 
 
120 As between the parties to this strike out application, I consider that there are two principles to be weighed up in this balancing exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">From the perspective of the Quall applicants, the principle is the well established right of any person to present to this Court a real and genuine controversy that has not been determined on its merits: see Batistatos at [158]-[161] per Kirby J, noting what the joint decision said about this right not being "at large" at [65].</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">On the other hand, from the perspective of the Northern Territory, the principle is that a person should not be twice vexed for the same cause: see Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung at 549-550 and 564-565.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">I can see no reason, in principle, why the latter does not apply equally to a party that is a body politic like the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">121 As to the first of these principles, the Quall applicants have already put forward as a real and genuine controversy the question whether the Danggalaba clan and/or the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system possessed rights and interests in relation to the Larrakia lands and waters in Area A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">That issue has been determined on the merits against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">They now say they wish to put forward as a real and genuine controversy the question whether the Top End society was the Aboriginal society at sovereignty that by the traditional laws and customs of its normative system possessed rights and interests in relation to the Larrakia lands and waters in Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">The Northern Territory says that this is vexing it twice for the same cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">122 On this matter, I consider that the balance tips in favour of the Northern Territory for the following reasons:
 
a) there is nothing to show that there is a real and genuine controversy in relation to the Top End society case being the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in Larrakia lands;
 
b) to the contrary, there is much to suggest that the Top End society case does not raise a real and genuine controversy of the kind suggested, not the least being the decision of Mansfield J in Risk that the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in Larrakia lands was the Larrakia peoples (see also my observations at [112] above); and
 
c) the Top End society case seeks to raise the same, or at least, a very similar, issue to that raised by the Quall applicants in Risk , which issue the Northern Territory has already successfully met in Risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">
 Conclusion on abuse of process in relation to the Top End society case 
 
123 For the reasons set out above, I conclude that it would constitute an abuse of process if the Quall applicants were to pursue the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Moreover, I am satisfied that is so to the high degree of certainty required of me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">In reaching this conclusion, I have had regard to all the matters which I have set out in detail above, including the following:
 
a) The issue as to what was the relevant Aboriginal society at sovereignty possessing rights and interests in Larrakia lands, was one of the ultimate issues in Risk and an issue of paramount importance in that case;
 
b) the Quall applicants had an ample opportunity, of which they availed themselves, to fully litigate that issue in Risk ;
 
c) the findings of Mansfield J on that issue in Risk were clear, directly apposite and final;
 
d) the critical issue raised by the Top End society case is (at least) very similar to the critical issue that was raised and determined in Risk ;
 
e) it would be contrary to the public policy concerns for the finality of litigation and in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice, to allow the Quall applicants to pursue the Top End society case in this native title application; and
 
f) the balance between the principle of providing free access to the courts and the principle of not vexing a person twice for the same cause, tips in favour of the latter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">124 Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary for me to consider the third issue set out in [71] above in relation to the Top End Society case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">CONCLUSION 
 
125 I appreciate the extreme caution, or high degree of certainty, that the High Court has said should be applied when deciding whether to summarily dismiss an application such as this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">I also take into account that at various times during the long history of these proceedings Mr Quall has not been legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">Notwithstanding these matters, I consider that this is one of those exceptional cases where this Court should intervene to summarily dismiss this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">126 In summary, for the reasons I have expressed above, I am satisfied to a high degree or certainty that:
 
&#8226; The decision in Risk gives rise to an issue estoppel to prevent the Quall applicants pursuing the Danggalaba clan case, the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, or the Top End society case in this native title application; and
 
&#8226; It would be an abuse of process for the Quall applicants to now pursue the Top End society case in this native title application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">127 I therefore propose to order that this native title application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-seven (127) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Reeves.</sentence>
