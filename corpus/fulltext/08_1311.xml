1 The applicant commenced proceedings in this Court as the representative of a group of investors (group members) who acquired shares in the respondent between 19 February 2002 and 26 May 2003 and who claim to have suffered loss and damage as a result of the respondent's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant claims that Aristocrat's conduct was in breach of its obligation of continuous disclosure imposed by the ASX rules and by s 674 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) or a breach of its obligation not to engage in misleading and deceptive conduct imposed either by s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) or the equivalent provisions of the Corporations Act or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1981 (Cth) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">
 
2 The solicitors, Maurice Blackburn, act for a number of group members, including the applicant, in relation to 556 shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">All of the group members for whom Maurice Blackburn act have entered into litigation funding agreements with IMF (Australia) Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These members are known as the "Funded Group Members".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">There is, however, an unknown number of group members who have not entered into litigation funding agreements with IMF and who have not retained Maurice Blackburn to act on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">These group members are known as the "Other Group Members".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Negotiations between the parties have led to a proposal for settlement of their dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Pursuant to s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in order to be effective a settlement must be approved by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 19 May 2008 a deed of settlement (Original Deed of Settlement) was executed by the applicant, the respondent, Maurice Blackburn and IMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Original Deed of Settlement provided that the amount available on settlement for Other Group Members was $20 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It provided that if, based on the information provided by Other Group Members, an initial assessment of the quantum of their claims exceeded that amount, the Original Deed and any settlement were at an end and of no effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 Pursuant to ss 33X and 33Y of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and with the consent of the parties, on 21 May 2008 I made orders directed to closing the class of participating group members, effectively so that the monetary entitlement of each group member could be ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I ordered that all group members were to be sent a notice (the Identification Notice) together with an Aristocrat Share Trading Information Form (the Proof) in the form annexed to the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Identification Notice stated that it was intended for "all persons identified on Aristocrat's share register as having acquired Aristocrat shares in the relevant period, except for those who have opted-out of the proceeding".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It stated:
 If you have received this notice you are potentially one of the Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">You are not a Group Member if you returned a Notice of Opting Out before 4.00pm, 8 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The Identification Notice further stated, in bold type, that the Court had ordered that group members who wished to participate in the conditional settlement were required to complete the enclosed Proof and "mail it" to Maurice Blackburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The date fixed by the Court for compliance with these instructions was 24 June 2008 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The documents were to be sent within 7 days of the Court's order to the last known address of the Funded Group Members and, in respect of the Other Group Members, the address shown on the register of shareholders held by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 Mr Jacob Varghese, an associate of the firm Maurice Blackburn who, with others, has the care and conduct of this proceeding on behalf of the applicant and group members, has sworn two affidavits, on 12 and 13 August 2008, in respect of those aspects of the matter presently under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Unless otherwise indicated, the facts stated in these reasons are taken from Mr Varghese's unchallenged affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">After the hearing and at the request of the Court, Mr Varghese provided a third affidavit sworn on 22 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">This affidavit is referred to below at [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 In accordance with the orders of 21 May 2008, the Identification Notice and Proof were sent to the Other Group Members on 27 May 2008 and to the Funded Group Members on 28 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">By 24 June 2008 Proofs had been submitted in respect of 2,331 shareholdings for Other Group Members; and 556 shareholdings for Funded Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The initial assessment of the claims of Other Group Members exceeded $20 million and thus the Original Deed of Settlement terminated according to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 Mr Varghese explained the subsequent events as follows:
 Further settlement negotiations ensued between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On 11 July 2008 a new Deed of Settlement ("the Deed") was executed by the Applicant, the Respondent, Maurice Blackburn and IMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Deed provides for $27 million to be available for Other Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Before this settlement was agreed, I assessed from the Proofs provided by [24 June 2008] that this sum was sufficient to distribute to Participating Other Group Members the same proportion of their loss in hand as Participating Funded Group Members would receive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Deed provides for two distinct funds: 
 
 (a) the " FGM Fund " of $109 million plus interest for distribution to Participating Funded Group Members; and
 (b) the " OGM Fund " of $27 million plus interest for distribution to Participating Other Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
If the claims of group members with Late Notified Holdings are included in the Final List of Participating Group Members, and the total value of Participating Other Group Members' claims then exceeds $27 million, then each Participating Other Group Member will receive a lesser distribution in hand than that which they would have received if they were a Participating Funded Group Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">9 On 18 July 2008 I made further orders in relation to the proposed settlement, again with the consent of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Those orders provided for the Notice of Proposed Settlement in the form annexed to the orders to be sent to the address recorded on the Proof submitted by each Participating Group Member; and, in respect of all other group members --- the address shown on the register of shareholders held by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Orders 3 and 4 of the orders made on 18 July 2008 provided as follows:
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">If any group member: 
 
 
 (a) did not submit a Proof by 24 June 2008, or did not include some part of the group member's shareholding in a Proof that was submitted by 24 June 2008 ("Late Notified Holding"); and
 (b) wishes to participate, in respect of the Late Notified Holding, in the distribution of any settlement payment pursuant to the proposed settlement of the proceeding upon the terms set out in the Deed of Settlement executed by the parties and dated 11 July 2008; 
 
 
 the group member must 
 
 
 (c) deliver to Maurice Blackburn by 4:00pm on 8 August 2008 a written statement as to the reasons why the Late Notified Holding was not included in a Proof submitted by 24 June 2008 and why the Late Notified Holding should be included on the Final List of Participating Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Maurice Blackburn must, upon receipt of any written statement of reasons in accordance with 3 (c), file and serve the statement and request the Court to list a hearing to determine whether the Late Notified Holding should be included on the Final List of Participating Group Members, provided however that if Maurice Blackburn considers that the statement of reasons discloses an error or omission by Maurice Blackburn it may accept the Late Notified Holding and notify the Court and Aristocrat accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Any hearing in accordance with this order be listed for 14 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 

10 On 21 July 2008 Mr Varghese mailed a letter (21 July letter) "to all those persons from whom we had received a Proof between 25 June and 21 July 2008 inclusive, to advise them of the Court's orders and the need for a statement of reasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Mr Varghese also noted that from 21 July 2008 to the date of his first affidavit (12 August 2008) he advised and instructed the Maurice Blackburn employees whom he supervised "to advise, all persons who have returned a Proof without a statement of reasons of the need to provide a statement of reasons by 4.00 pm, 8 August 2008 in accordance with the Settlement Notice Orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Varghese continued:
 On 1 August 2008, on reviewing the Statements of Reasons received by that date, Mr Murphy and I noted that most of the Statements of Reasons provided reasons that were unsupported by any evidence other than the assertion of the Late Notified Group Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">We decided to seek their reasons in the form of a statutory declaration or sworn affidavit in all cases other than those in which a postmarked enveloped [sic] confirmed that the Late Notified Group Member had mailed the Proof on or before 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">On 1 August 2008 I mailed a letter by Express Post to each Late Notified Group Member other than those with a postmark on or before 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I also enclosed a copy of a standard form Commonwealth statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">... From 1 August 2008 to date I advised, and I instructed the Maurice Blackburn employees under my supervision to advise, all telephone and email enquirers that they should provide a statutory declaration or sworn affidavit in support of, or by way of, the statement of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Further, the Maurice Blackburn employees under my supervision have endeavoured to contact by telephone, email or Express Post all of those persons who have provided Statements of Reasons without a statutory declaration or sworn affidavit to provide this advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">11 On 14 August 2008 a hearing was held in the Federal Court, in accordance with orders made on 18 July 2008, to determine whether the Late Notified Holdings should be included on the Final List of Participating Group Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr A Franklin SC was briefed by Maurice Blackburn to appear as a contradictor at the hearing to make submissions to the Court on behalf of the Late Notified Members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">12 Maurice Blackburn sorted the statements of reasons received by 4.00 pm on 8 August 2008 into categories for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Before considering these categories it is necessary to articulate the principles to be applied in making the determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The relevant principles 
 
13 At the hearing Aristocrat provided a note outlining its position in relation to the recognition of the claims of Late Notified Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It stated that the "orderly and efficient resolution of the proceedings ... is in the collective interests of the parties, group members as a whole and the wider public (insofar as it frees up scarce court resources to deal with other disputes)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I agree with this proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It follows that the deadline set by the Court for group members to elect whether or not they wish to be included in the proposed settlement of the representative proceeding must be taken seriously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Until the class of participating group members is closed and the members of the closed class identified there can be no final settlement and no distribution of settlement monies to members of the class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">14 Taking the deadline seriously means that a group member who did not comply with the deadline should not be permitted to participate in the settlement unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that it would be unjust to exclude the group member; King v AG Australia Holdings Ltd (formerly GIO Australia, Holdings Ltd) [2003] FCA 1420.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In making this determination the Court must take into account not only the stated reason but also any corroborative evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The reasons for non-compliance may vary from person to person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In each case the statement of reasons and any corroborative evidence must be considered by the Court on its individual merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It is not necessary, if indeed it were possible, to make an exhaustive list of the circumstances which would make it unfair to exclude a group member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Applying the principles 
 
15 In considering the statements of reasons provided by Late Notified Group members it is relevant to bear in mind the form in which the notices that went to the group members were sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Identification Notice sent in May 2008 stated in bold capitals:
 IF YOU WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THIS REPRESENTATIVE ACTION YOU MUST COMPLY WITH THIS NOTICE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">IF YOU DO NOT DO SO YOUR RIGHTS MAY BE LOST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 The notice referred to the "conditional settlement" and stated that the Court had ordered that group members wishing to participate in a conditional settlement must complete and mail the Proof by 24 June 2008 to Maurice Blackburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 The subsequent notice sent in July 2008 was headed in bold: "Notice to Group Members --- Proposed Settlement of Class Action".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It stated: 
 If you did not submit any Proof (or complete Proof) by 24 June 2008 you are not a Participating Group Member and you will not receive a distribution of money under the proposed settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">If you are in this category, but you still wish to make a claim in the class action, you are required to provide a statement of reasons why you should be included as a Participating Group Member, together with a Proof, and the Court will be asked to make a determination in your case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The statement of reasons and the Proof must be received by Maurice Blackburn at the address above by no later than 4 pm, 8 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">You may need to attend and/or make submissions to the Court to enable the Court to make this determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">18 Persons receiving these notices could reasonably be expected to understand that this was an important matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Identification Notice makes it very clear that members who do not comply with the notice may jeopardise their rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The 21 July letter is equally clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is not unreasonable to expect members who were uncertain as to the action required of them or how the circumstances outlined in these documents applied to them to seek assistance, legal or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Similarly, given the fact that the request for a statement of reasons also stated that the Court would be asked to make a determination, it is reasonable to expect members to realise that they should state their reasons with sufficient clarity and detail to persuade the Court to make a determination in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">19 As mentioned above, Maurice Blackburn advised many Late Notified Group Members who had provided their reasons in an unsworn statement, to provide a statutory declaration or affidavit in support of their reasons; see [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Members thus notified would have an additional reason for understanding that this statement needed to be persuasive and, where they failed to provide a sworn statement, the Court is entitled to be sceptical about their unsworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">This does not mean that such a statement would be disbelieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Sufficient independent corroboration might, for example, be provided to support the reasons given despite the statement being unsworn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This scepticism would not extend to members who, not having been so advised, provided unsworn statements of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It would be unreasonable to expect persons who were asked only "to provide a statement of reasons" to provide a sworn statement when they had not been asked to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Mr Varghese's third affidavit (see [6] above) named all Late Notified Group members who failed to provide a sworn statement after having been advised to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">20 In its outline of the "basic principles", Aristocrat stated that "anything short of a statutory declaration (such as a letter merely asserting the existence of grounds) is not sufficient" for a Late Notified Group Member to be included in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I do not think that this approach can be justified in all circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The formal notice sent pursuant to the Court orders merely requested a statement of reasons; it did not specify that a statutory declaration or affidavit should be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">As mentioned above, some group members were advised to provide a statutory declaration and where this is the case it is reasonable to attribute some significance to the failure to provide a sworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Where, however, the relevant group member did not receive such advice, it would be unfair to dismiss their statement of reasons merely because it is an unsworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In those circumstances the unsworn statement, subject to inherent inconsistency or improbability should be accepted as a statement of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">21 Similarly, the Court should accept statements made on oath, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">This does not mean, however, that sworn or unsworn statements that are accepted as true will necessarily be accepted as providing a good reason for the lateness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Court is not obliged to accept the reasons given uncritically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In such a case it is still necessary for the reasons given to be sufficient to satisfy the Court that the member should be included in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It may be that, even if everything that is stated is accepted as true, the reason is not sufficient to justify non-compliance with the deadline of 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">For instance, I am prepared to accept that a group member who was overseas for the period between 27 May and 24 June 2008 and who did not return the Proof before 24 June 2008 has a good reason for not complying with the Court deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">This does not mean, however, that the statement, "I was overseas at the relevant time", submitted without details of the dates between which the group member was overseas and without any documentary evidence such as boarding passes or airline tickets, is sufficient to satisfy the Court that there is a good reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Categories of Late Notified Group Members 
 
22 For purposes of the hearing on 14 August 2008 Maurice Blackburn divided the Late Notified Group Members whose statements of reasons or Proofs were received by 4.00 pm, 8 August 2008 into eight categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Tender bundles containing the statement of reasons grouped in those categories were provided to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I have calculated the number of group members in each category from the documents tendered and in the following list of those categories, have shown that number in parentheses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The categories are:
 
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Proofs postmarked 24 June 2008 or before; (89 of whom 34 submitted statements of reasons and 55 have not submitted statements) 
 B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Proofs received 25-26 June 2008, but where no postmark is recorded; (18 of whom 9 submitted statements of reasons and 9 have not submitted statements) 
 C. Claimant alleges that a Proof was mailed before 24 June 2008, but no postmark is available or Proof was never received by Maurice Blackburn; (4 statements of reasons received) 
 D. Claimant alleges that they were overseas or away in the period 27 May 2008 to 24 June 2008; (40 statements of reasons received) 
 E. Claimant alleges that the Identification Notice was not received in the period 27 May 2008 to 24 June 2008; (39 statements of reasons received) 
 F. Claimant alleges that they were ill, bereaved or caring for relatives in the period 27 May 2008 to 24 June 2008; (12 statements of reasons received) 
 
G. Other reasons; (38 statements of reasons received) and 
 
 H. Statement of reasons received, but no Proof had been received by 4pm, 8 August 2008; (8 statements of reasons received) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 

23 In his submission on behalf of the Late Notified Members, Mr Franklin SC stated that there was no objection to the categories identified by Maurice Blackburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He summarised the general approach adopted in his submissions as follows:
 In all cases in which it is reasonable to assume, on the probabilities, that the Proof was posted on or before 24 June 2008, the contradictor will submit that the member should be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">This includes not only cases where the envelope was postmarked 24 June 2008 or before, but also other cases where it is reasonable to assume, on the probabilities, that the proof was mailed on [or] before that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">An example is where the Proof was received on 25 (or perhaps 26) June 2008 -- it is reasonable to assume that the Proof was mailed on or before the critical date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In many cases a statutory declaration has been filed together with some independent evidence (document or other declaration) which, if believed, establishes either that the Proof was mailed on time or that there was some legitimate reason preventing the member from posting the Proof by 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In all cases where there is credible independent evidence to support the assertion the contradictor will recommend inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In many cases there are statutory declarations filed without any independent evidence to support the statements made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Each such case will have to be looked at on its own merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">For example, some members have sworn that they did not receive the Identification Notice and have provided credible background evidence as to why this was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In those cases, it is submitted, that the Court should favourably consider inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In other cases there is a statutory declaration that contains no more than a bald assertion that the Identification Notice was not received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It will be for the court to decide whether to accept sworn statements to this affect [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In these submissions the contradictor has attempted to group different categories of evidence together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In cases in which the contradictor is of the view that there is no convincing argument to be made for inclusion, having regard to the definition of categories and the reasons given by the Claimant, no submissions are made in favour of inclusion but in each case the reasons advanced by the Claimant are summarised in the appendix to these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">In respect of each Claimant who has been excluded the contradictor has read the material sent to [Maurice Blackburn] and correspondence from [Maurice Blackburn] to the complainant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If no submission is made for the inclusion of a particular complainant (in which event he, and she or it is not mentioned in the body of these submissions and only in the appendix) that is because the contradictor has formed the view that the documents do not disclose sufficient reasons for inclusion and the contradictor has been unable to articulate tenable arguments in favour of inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">However, it would be remiss of the contradictor not to put each individual's submissions before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">For this reason the submissions and reasons in this category (where the contradictor makes no specific submission for inclusion) are summarised in the appendix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In every case in which the contradictor is of the view that there is some material which supports at least a tenable case from inclusion, submissions will be made on behalf of the complainants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">[Emphasis in original] Categories A and B 
 
24 Mr Franklin submitted that all group members in categories A and B should be included in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Aristocrat accepted that in both these categories there is objective evidence that the Proof was mailed prior to the 24 June 2008 deadline and that the group member should be allowed to participate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Such agreement, although not binding on me, is highly persuasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">I have reviewed the statements of reasons in respect of all these members and have formed the view that the position adopted by Aristocrat and the contradictor is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">No more need be said about categories A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Names of the members in these categories are contained in Schedule 1 appended to these reasons and to the Court orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Category C 
 
25 One of the five members included in this category, Bradley Foot , should have been in category B as his Proof was received on 25 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">For that reason he should be included as a participant in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">26 Both Mr Franklin and Aristocrat submitted that all members in category C had sworn statutory declarations to the effect that the Proof had been sent prior to the deadline although it was received either after the deadline or not at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">That does not, however, appear to be the case in respect of the statement of reasons submitted by Tuan Nguyen .</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Although Mr Nguyen provided a statutory declaration, it does not refer to the reasons for his Proof being submitted after the deadline but only to his belief that Aristocrat's conduct had caused him loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The statement of reasons submitted by Mr Nguyen is contained in a letter dated 24 July 2008 in which he states that he had misplaced the form but had completed it and sent it on 23 June 2008, apparently by ordinary post, and thought it would arrive on time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">There is no evidence that Mr Nguyen was advised to provide his reasons in the form of a statutory declaration and therefore, consistent with the approach set out in [20] above I shall disregard this failure to provide a sworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">27 According to the statement of reasons table prepared by Maurice Blackburn and tendered by Mr Franklin as Exhibit 2, the Proofs submitted by Mr Nguyen and Raymond Isbester were received on 1 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Isbester deposed that the Identification Notice was sent to his previous residential address despite his having requested that mail be sent to a post office box number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The fact that both Proofs were received before the 21 July letter had been sent provides some support for the claims that the Proofs were sent prior to the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In the circumstances both Mr Isbester and Mr Nguyen should be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">28 Manjiri Sanjay Sarode deposed that she had sent the relevant documents "prior to June 24 th , 2008 by ordinary post".</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">They were not received and she provided replacement documents that were received on 7 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The statement is short on detail but, assuming it to be a correct statement, there is little more that could be said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">If documents sent prior to 24 June just did not arrive it is not surprising that Mrs Sarode was unaware of this until it was brought to her attention by the 21 July letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In those circumstances her uncontradicted sworn statement should be accepted and Mrs Sarode should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">29 The final member in category C is Anita Joy Harvey .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Ms Harvey provided a statutory declaration sworn on 8 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">She deposed that she had responded to the Identification Notice "on or about May 2008".</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">She added:
 The documentation was accompanied by a notation stating that I was unsure of the date of purchase and subsequent sale of my Aristocrat shares but I had sold them at a loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">At the time of postage I also emailed Maurice Blackburn requesting information from them but did not receive a response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Upon receiving the most recent Notice to Group Members I telephoned Maurice Blackburn and was told no correspondence had been received by them from me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">30 Aspects of this statement invite some scepticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Identification Notice was sent to Ms Harvey (an Other Group Member) on 27 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">If, as she deposed, she had responded "on or about May 2008", she must have acted very promptly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It is surprising that, when asked to give reasons for the delay she did not refer to her prompt response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">She said she also emailed Maurice Blackburn requesting information but was subsequently told that "no correspondence" from her had been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In the circumstances one might have expected her to provide a copy of the email she had sent or at least explain why no copy was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Ultimately, there are gaps in Ms Harvey's statement of reasons that reflect on its credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I do consider that she should be included as a participating member.</sentence>

31 Mr Franklin divided category D into three subcategories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The first comprised "those who have submitted sworn evidence that they were overseas or away during the Identification Period, with supporting evidence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The Identification Period to which Mr Franklin refers is the period between 27 May and 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Mr Franklin recommended that these persons should be included "on the basis that there is reliable evidence that they did not receive the notification in time to respond before 24 June 2008".</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Aristocrat conceded that all the members in this subcategory identified by Mr Franklin should be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">I am satisfied that this is the correct decision and will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">32 I note that Mr Franklin included Anne Davis in this subcategory although she did not provide a sworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">She did, however, provide detailed documentary evidence in support of her claim to have been away from her home in Tasmania between 21 February and 3 August.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In the circumstances and despite her not providing a sworn statement when advised to do so, I accept her explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Subcategory D(2) 
 
33 The second subcategory comprises those who "submitted sworn evidence that they were away or overseas during the Identification Period, but without any supporting documentary evidence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Franklin submitted that the sworn evidence of persons in this subcategory "might be sufficient to persuade the court" to include them as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Three members in this subcategory were recommended for inclusion by Mr Franklin and those recommendations were accepted by Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In those three cases there was, in fact, some corroborative evidence either because the statutory declaration was sworn by a third person in a position to know of the member's movements or, in one case, because a customs declaration, a detailed itinerary and copies of the relevant pages from the passport were submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">34 I have formed the view that two members of subcategory D(2) who were not accepted by Aristocrat should nevertheless be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In response to the request for a statement of reasons Rodney Hugh Powell stated in a letter dated July 25, 2008, "I did not receive the original correspondence till after the date it was due as I was travelling".</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In a statutory declaration made on 5 August 2008 he said he could not say why he did not receive the documentation in time but commented that it was not uncommon for mail to be "inconsistently delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">We often get mail not addressed to us, as does our neighbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">We also get some mail with a redirected note on it because it has been delivered to the wrong place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">" Mr Powell's Proof was received on 1 July 2008 which is not long after the due date and gives some credence to his explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">He should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">35 In a statutory declaration sworn on 6 August 2008 Rick Streiner deposed that he was in the United States from 30 May until 19 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">He stated that he did not clear his mailbox until after the closing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Mr Streiner's Proof was received on 7 August 2008 --- presumably it was sent with his statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Initially I was inclined to think that the delay of more than six weeks between 19 June when he returned to Australia and when his Proof was received, suggested unnecessary delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">On re-reading the 21 July letter however I have revised this opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">A person in Mr Streiner's position might well assume from the Identification Notice that once he had missed the deadline for returning the Proof he had entirely missed the opportunity to participate in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">It states: "only those Group Members who return the Proof by that date [24 June 2008] will be entitled to participate in the settlement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The letter of 21 July suggests, however, that it might not be too late to participate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The letter states that "if you did not submit any proof (or a complete proof) by 24 June 2008 ... but you still wish to make a claim in the class action, you are required to provide a statement of reasons why you should be included as a Participating Group Member, with a Proof, and the Court will be asked to make a determination in your case".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">This would explain the six week delay, and the likelihood of this interpretation is such that Mr Streiner should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">36 I do not accept that the other eleven members of this subcategory should be included in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Their statements of reasons are weak on details and do not provide a reasonable explanation for delay without the Court filling in gaps in the statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In the cases of the following six group members, their statements indicate that, while they may have been away, the matter had not been given sufficient priority among the competing demands of everyday life for the documents to be completed and returned by the deadline: Debbie Montagnino ; Realife Pty Ltd as trustee of the E &amp; G MacDougall Super Fund (Gareth and Edith MacDougall) ; Manjay Investments Pty Ltd (Noel Freeman) ; Tanya Vernik ; Tim Norman ; and Patrick Michael Ffrench .</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">While this is entirely understandable, it is not a sufficient reason for departing from the deadline imposed by the Court and communicated to the group member in self-evidently formal and important documents, being the Identification Notice and the 21 July letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I note that Mr Ffrench's initial explanation dated 1 August 2008 was as explained above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Maurice Blackburn also received a sworn statement dated 11 August 2008 from Mr Ffrench in which he stated "I have been away and didn't receive your letter until 7.08.08".</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Maurice Blackburn also received a letter from WHK Howarth, a member of Howarth International, concerning (among others) Mr Ffrench's shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The letter did not add anything of substance to the reasons submitted by Mr Ffrench.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It is not easy to understand exactly what explanation Mr Ffrench is proffering, which supports my conclusion that there are simply not sufficient details to find in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">37 The other five members in this subcategory, the Bright Group (Murat Aji) , Anthony Burns , Peter Stanley Whetton , Continental Petroleum Resources Pty Ltd (John Tassell) and James Francis Irving , deposed to being away from home at the relevant time but provided insufficient details about the dates they were absent for their explanations to be accepted as satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Subcategory D(3) 
 
38 This subcategory comprises members who claim to have been overseas or away during the period between 27 May and 24 June and who have provided neither a statutory declaration nor any supporting documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Mr Franklin did not make any submissions in respect of this group however he listed these members with a short summary of their statements of reasons in an appendix to his written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">There are seven members in this subcategory, two of whom were sent advice to file a statutory declaration but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">They are Sacsalia Pty Ltd (Margaret Littman) and Connors Building Pty Ltd (Julieanne Connors) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">In the circumstances I do not accept that they have provided a sufficient explanation of their failure to meet the deadline imposed by the Court and will not order that they be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">39 Although I am prepared to overlook the absence of a statutory declaration (for reasons given at [20] above) in respect of the other two members of this subcategory, in the absence of specific details or supporting documentation, I cannot accept their statements of reasons as providing a satisfactory explanation of their failure to meet the deadline and reject their application to be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The two members are AR Franks and Tey Bian .</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In addition to these members, Maurice Blackburn received a Proof from Peter Dunn on 22 July 2008 in an envelope which was postmarked 16 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Mr Dunn's statement of reasons was received by facsimile on 15 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He states, 
 I live in Hong Kong and travel around the region frequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">I received the letter dated 29 July, only yesterday!</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Given that I was a shareholder of Aristocrat during the relevant time period I would like to be included as a Participating Group Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">40 I assume the reference to a letter dated 29 July was intended to refer to Maurice Blackburn' s 21 July letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">In my view, this explanation, which I am prepared to accept as a true statement, does not provide sufficient detail to justify waiving the deadline for Mr Dunn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">41 The fifth member of this subcategory, Jane Margaret Reed , stated that she was travelling overseas from 8 May to 30 July 2008 and did not receive the Identification Notice or the 21 July letter until she returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Her Proof and statement of reasons were received on 8 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Accepting her statement as true, she should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">42 Geoffrey Stewart was originally included in category H on the basis that he had not provided a Proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This categorisation was revised, however, because although he did not submit the formal Proof he did submit relevant buy and sell details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">His explanation for delay was that he was overseas between 11 May 2008 and 29 June 2008, and although he did not submit a statutory declaration (despite being advised to do so), he provided copies of itineraries confirming this account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">His inclusion is conceded by Aristocrat, and I will order that he be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Category E 
 
43 Claimants in this category have alleged that they did not receive the Identification Notice within the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Some claimed that they received it later, and others that they did not receive it at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">In relation to the latter group, s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) raises a presumption that it was received at the relevant address on the "fourth working day after having been posted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">This presumption applies, "unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced"; s 160(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">As explained below, I have considered the written statements of the claimants and where I have accepted their explanation, it is because, in my view, the evidence raises the doubt to which s 160(1) refers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Subcategory E(1) 
 
44 For the purpose of his recommendations, Mr Franklin divided category E into three subcategories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The first subcategory consists of those who stated that they did not receive the Identification Notice by 24 June 2008 and have submitted sworn evidence to this effect supported by documentary or independent evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Mr Franklin recommended that all members in this subcategory be included as participating members in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Aristocrat has conceded these claims and I am satisfied it was correct to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Subcategory E(2) 
 
45 This subcategory includes those who have also submitted sworn evidence that they did not receive the Identification Notice by 24 June but have not provided any supporting documentary or independent evidence in support of this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In his oral submissions, Mr S G Finch SC, who appeared for Aristocrat, made the following submission: 
 We say that your Honour should be inclined to accept the facts deposed to in the statutory declarations subject, of course, to any inherent improbability or defect or contradiction that your Honour can observe but we have to concede that in all except one case there has been no cross-examination of these people and we also have to observe, and this cross-fertilises with my second point, that the mere fact that there is no supporting documentation is not necessarily fatal to their claim because after all they're not lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They were simply told put on a statutory declaration and in many cases they did so and they're not aware of the techniques of persuading your Honour to a certain view rather than to another view and the nature of evidence itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">... although one can observe the lack of documentation as an interesting and relevant factor we don't suggest it's fatal but the strength we do say of any explanation can be vitiated by the lack of expected documentation where there's no reason given for why it's not there ... 
46 Mr Finch's comments are particularly pertinent in relation to 23 of the 26 members in this subcategory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">These 23 members have submitted sworn statements that they did not receive the Identification Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Their statements have not been contradicted and contain no inherent improbability, defect, inconsistency or contradiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Moreover, given that the statements are to the effect that they did not receive the Identification Notice, it is difficult to imagine what documentation in support of that statement might be expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">I have therefore concluded that these 23 members should be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">47 Of the remaining three members in this subcategory, only one should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">In a statutory declaration made on 4 August 2008 Christopher Harley (on behalf of Moontrax Pty Ltd) gave reasons why his Proof had not been received by the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Annexed to the second affidavit of Mr Varghese, however, is an opting out notice dated 24 November 2006, completed by Mr Harley on behalf of Moontrax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Mr Harley's application clearly must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">48 The other two members, Jonathan David Ind and My Chau Huynh , have submitted statutory declarations deposing to their late receipt of the Identification Notice as explanation for their respective Proofs not being received by Maurice Blackburn by the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The principle applied above at [43] also applies here and these applications should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Subcategory E(3) 
 
49 This subcategory includes those who wrote or sent an email to Maurice Blackburn alleging that they did not receive the Identification Notice before 24 June but did not provide a statutory declaration or include any documents or independent evidence to support this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Mr Franklin made no submissions in support of these persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There are six persons in this subcategory, five of whom, Phillip Field , Peter Tonkin (Petcan Investments Pty Ltd --- Hampton Family Trust) , Brenton Smith , State Street Global and Stephen Kappelos were advised to provide a statutory declaration in support of their allegations but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In the circumstances, and applying the principles outlined in [20] above, I am not satisfied that a mere unsworn statement without supporting documentation provides an explanation sufficient for me to disregard the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">50 The other member of this subcategory, Robert Kneeshaw , provided a statement of reasons, which, in essence, stated that he did not receive the Identification Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The statement contains no inherent improbability, defect, inconsistency or contradiction and therefore, in accordance with the principles set out at [46], I accept Mr Kneeshaw's explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Category F 
 Subcategory F(1) 
 
51 Mr Franklin divided this category into three subcategories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The first comprises those who have submitted sworn evidence supported by documentary or independent evidence that they were incapacitated (through illness or unavoidable commitments) during the period from 27 May to 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Mr Franklin submitted that these persons should be included on the basis that there is reliable evidence that they could not reasonably respond before the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">I note that the unavoidable commitments and illnesses to which the members in this subcategory deposed, go well beyond the normal clutter and confusion of everyday life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">They included factors such as unexpected deaths in the family and diagnoses and treatment of serious illnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Aristocrat conceded that applications in this subcategory should be accepted, and in my view these members should be included as participating members in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Subcategory F(2) 
 
52 This subcategory comprises members who have submitted sworn evidence that they were incapacitated as a result of illness or unavoidable commitments during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">They have not submitted any supporting documentary or independent evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">There are four members in this subcategory, Betty May Gallen , Tracey Mayoh , Maureen Bell and Pamela Anne Gehrig.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
 
53 Even accepting the truth of the reasons they have given I do not accept as a satisfactory explanations the statements of Ms Gallen or Ms Mayoh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Ms Mayoh said that her father had been suffering from "heart failure" and that she had been busy taking him to and from hospital and appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">She said that this left her no time to follow up on personal business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Mrs Gallen deposed that she and her husband were both ill with the flu and were bedridden for 7-8 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">She added that she thought the date for the return of the form was the end of the month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In fact her Proof was received on 1 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Both explanations are short on detail, and I am unable to assess the extent to which the events described intruded into the period during which the Proofs should have been returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Given that there was approximately one month in which the Proofs could have been returned I do not accept these statements as providing adequate reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">54 Similarly, I do not accept the statement made by Ms Bell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Her reasons related to the demands of her work, mail being misplaced by a family member and some family setbacks, including caring part-time for an elder brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Accepting this as a true statement I do not regard it as a sufficient reason for waiving the deadline imposed by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">55 Ms Gehrig submitted a statutory declaration stating that she needed to travel to Sydney in relation to the diagnosis of a serious and life-threatening medical condition of which there is a significant family history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">She claims to have been distracted by worry about her medical situation, and I accept that an unexpected event such as this is an adequate explanation for her Proof not having been received until 7 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Subcategory F(3) 
 
56 Members who fall into this subcategory are those who have provided an unsworn statement along with independent evidence to support their claims of being unable to return the Proof on time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">There are two members in this subcategory and Mr Franklin recommended both for inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">One claimant, Suzette Yuen , claiming on behalf of Sunajoy Pty Ltd, was advised to provide a statutory declaration and failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Despite this, the independent evidence, consisting of a statement provided by her daughter explaining the claimant's serious ill-health as well as that of the claimant' s 94 year old mother, and a letter from the medical practitioner concerned, is such that I do not draw any adverse inference from the failure to provide a sworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Aristocrat has conceded this claim and I am satisfied that this claimant should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">57 The other member of this subcategory is Raymond Sakoua , claiming on behalf of the Sakoua Super Fund, who stated that he was diagnosed with a severe and life-threatening illness which required him to have daily treatment in hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">His statement is supported by a letter from his medical practitioner, describing the treatment and its side-effects, and as well as by medical records from the treating hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">I am satisfied that, despite his failure to provide a sworn statement when advised to do so, this claimant should be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Subcategory F(4) 
 
58 This subcategory comprises those who have written or emailed Maurice Blackburn alleging that they were incapacitated, either through illness or unavoidable commitments, during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">They have not included any independent evidence to support their claims, which are made in unsworn statements, however none of them was advised to provide a sworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Mr Franklin did not make any submissions to include these persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Consistent with the principles already outlined I do not draw any adverse inference from the failure to provide an unsworn statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">That leaves for determination the question whether the statements, not being supported by independent evidence, are nonetheless convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Selena Burne explains that in the case of the shareholding held by herself and her husband, the Proof was submitted after the deadline because of serious illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Although not supported by evidence, the detail she provided of her experiences is sufficient, in my view, to explain the delay, and I would include her as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">59 Beverley McDermott , claiming on behalf of Chris McDermott Agencies Pty Ltd, similarly claimed to have been distracted by a serious medical condition diagnosed in April 2008 and consequently to have been distracted from dealing with "some important Company business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Unlike the previous situation considered, no detail is given of the extent of the illness or the time involved in dealing with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">In the absence of these details I am not satisfied that a sufficient explanation for excusing non-compliance with the deadline has been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Even less convincing is the explanation provided by Michele Kenny , who merely stated that "illness had prevented submission by the due date".</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">No other details were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">This is not a satisfactory explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Category G 
 
60 Members of category G provided "other reasons" for submitting late Proofs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Mr Franklin submitted that in many of these cases "there is insufficient detail to warrant a recommendation of inclusion, or the reasons given are not sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">" He identified only four claimants who, he suggested, had "tenable arguments for inclusion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">I have grouped these four in subcategory G(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">I have reviewed the statements of the remaining members of category G and agree that all should be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">My reasons are discussed below under subcategory G(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Subcategory G(1) 
 
61 The first member in subcategory G(1), Sidney Penketh , submitted a statutory declaration stating that his paperwork regarding proof of claims was left in the Cook Islands on the basis of his understanding that "it was a case of if you do not wish to opt out --- do nothing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">His Proof, along with the statutory declaration, was received on 27 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">I am not satisfied that Mr Penketh's sworn statement sufficiently explains why he waited until after the 21 July letter to send in his Proof, which had of course been requested in May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">His inclusion is disputed by Aristocrat, and I agree with this position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">62 The second claimant whom Mr Franklin recommended for inclusion is the Monetary Authority of Singapore , whose explanation, provided in the form of a sworn statement and supporting documentation, he summarised in the following way:
 The effect of this claimant's account, your Honour, is that the Monetary Authority of Singapore left to an agent, APSSF Management, to proceed with the relevant lodgement and on 24 June --- that is the date --- so the Monetary Authority of Singapore were clearly aware of the significance of the date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">MAS wrote to its agent, APSAM, to confirm that it had submitted the proof and a day later, on 25 June, APSAM replied that it had not done so and that is apparently contrary to the instructions and perhaps in breach of their agreement with their principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Then, your Honour, MAS immediately contacted Maurice Blackburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">63 I agree, however, with Mr Finch's submission that the reason for the lateness is mere inadvertence or delay, regardless of whether it was on the part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore or their agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">As Mr Finch submitted, it may be that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a claim against its agent (an issue on which I express no opinion) but, in accordance with the principles outlined above at [21], I am not satisfied that they have provided a sufficient explanation to justify their inclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">64 Mr Franklin also recommended that Nathan Abrahams be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Mr Abrahams claimed in an unsworn statement to have moved from Melbourne to Adelaide for work reasons and to have left his financial records, including share trading records, in storage in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">He claims that on receiving the Identification Notice from Maurice Blackburn, he travelled to Melbourne twice, the second attempt being in June, to find the relevant documents, and had been unable to submit his Proof earlier due to "work and family commitments, and the travel arrangements required to enable a physical search of share trading records".</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">No supporting documentation was provided, however applying the principles set out above at [20] I accept Mr Abrahams' explanation, which was received on 1 July 2008, as a statement of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">There is some force in Mr Finch's submission that his explanation amounts to a confession of mere inadvertence or delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">On balance, I am prepared to accept that one week's delay is understandable in circumstances where the relevant documents were located in another State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">I will order that Mr Abrahams be included as a participating member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">65 The final member whom Mr Franklin recommended for inclusion is Robert Keith Macquarie Forster .</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Mr Forster's explanation, given in a sworn statement, was that he was preoccupied with his daughter's wedding on 24 May 2008 and visiting family members, and did not open the "Aristocrat document" until after the 24 June deadline had expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">As with the claimants discussed above at [36], in my view Mr Forster's statement indicates that the matter had not been given sufficient priority among the competing demands of everyday life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">This is not a sufficient reason for failing to comply with the deadline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Subcategory G(2) 
 
66 Some members in this subcategory were advised by Maurice Blackburn, following the provision of an unsworn statement, to provide a statutory declaration but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Their explanations are not supported by any independent evidence and are short on details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">This is the case with the statements of reasons submitted by Peter Townsend Superannuation Fund (Peter Townsend) and Peter Townsend Investments Pty Ltd (Peter Townsend) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Consistent with the principle outlined at [20] above, I do not accept that they have provided a sufficient explanation of their failure to meet the deadline imposed by the Court and will not order that they be included as participating members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">This is also the case in respect of John Harris and Samuel Kavourakis , whose Proofs were received on 1 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Maurice Blackburn received a letter dated 4 August 2008 from Andrew Lawler of WHK Howarth, a member of Howarth International, written on behalf of Mr Harris and Mr Kavourakis (also Mr Ffrench --- see [36] above) which merely stated that "late lodgement occurred because of difficulty in locating the original cost details".</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">67 Some members, namely Subodh Purohit , Alfonso Fanelli and Frances Maree Rand simply did not provide any explanation for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">For this reason, they should also be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">68 A number of members claimed that they did not understand the significance of submitting the Proofs, made incorrect assumptions about participating in the group or the settlement, or did not understand the Identification Notice, and for those reasons did not respond to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The members are Rodney Roy Wise , Barry and Claudette Kelly , Ricardo Zamora , Freda Moore , Chris Tan , Beryl Donna Sturesteps (Spod Nominees Pty Ltd) and Darren Curley .</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">As I explained above at [18], it is reasonable to expect the members who did not understand the communications from Maurice Blackburn to have recognised, nonetheless, that they were of some importance, and to have sought help in understanding their position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">I therefore do not accept this lack of understanding as a sufficient reason for not enforcing the deadline imposed by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The statement of reasons submitted by T Williams (Fred's Estate Pty Ltd) , which was sent to this Court and received on 7 August 2008, also falls into this subcategory and is similarly not included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">69 Some members explained, in either sworn or unsworn statements, that they missed the deadline due to other commitments (for example work, moving house, home renovations etc), because they temporarily misplaced the relevant documents or generally had trouble locating the relevant documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Those members are Leticia Rankine , Rossana Wilcox , John McPherson , Amal Industries Superfund (Frederik Henrik Wegenaar) , Daniel Chan , Daniel Munk , Zia-Ud Din , Ann Nhu Nguyen , Ann Nhu Nguyen and Viet Thang Phung , Vawdrey Super Fund (Malcolm Robert Vawdrey) , Munk Nominees Pty Limited Superannuation Fund (Daniel Munk) , Allan Kwok (Winan Investments Pty Ltd) , Ruel Lagazo , Gary John Stevenson , Ryan Donnelly , Sonja Heron and Barry Allen .</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Consistent with the approach to the claimants referred to at [36] above, in the absence of further detail or independent support, these reasons amount to no more than a statement about the competing demands of everyday life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">As I have previously indicated, this is an understandable but insufficient reason for failing to comply with the deadline and these members should not be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">70 There are two members of this subcategory whose explanations for delay warrant some additional mention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The first, William Robins Redpath (Redpath Auto Super Fund) , provided a statutory declaration stating that, following receipt of the Identification Notice, he did not understand what was required of him and so sent the letter to his stockbroker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Having had no reply, he assumed his stockbroker had dealt with the matter and only later discovered (although he did not specify a date) that his stockbroker had not attended to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Because the deadline had by that time passed, he stated that he filed the Identification Notice until he received the second letter from Maurice Blackburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">His Proof and statutory declaration were received on 8 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">This explanation is reminiscent both of the explanation from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (see [62] --- failure of an agent to act, along with an incorrect assumption on the part of the member that the agent had acted) and that of Mr Streiner (see [35] --- assumption that, having missed the deadline stated in the Identification Notice, the opportunity to participate in the settlement was no longer available).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Although, as discussed at [35] above, this is a reasonable assumption that would explain Mr Redpath's delay after he learnt of his stockbroker's failure to act, I do not accept as reasonable his assumption that his stockbroker had taken care of the matter in the absence of any confirmation or follow-up call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Whilst his explanation is plausible, it is not in my view sufficient to justify his late entry into the group participating in the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">71 The second member warranting some further attention is Brett Neville Casben on behalf of WA Casben Investments Pty Ltd. Mr Casben had filed a statutory declaration explaining his delay and attended the hearing on 14 August 2008 at which he was cross-examined on his statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">He testified at the hearing that, following receipt of the Identification Notice, he had contacted his accountants to ascertain whether there were any share trading records for the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">His accountants informed him that any such documents were in storage and there was a charge of $300 for retrieving them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Mr Casben decided not to proceed until he received the 21 July letter, following which he himself searched a storage area the company had previously used and located the relevant documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He then made further enquiries of his sharebrokers and finally submitted the information to Maurice Blackburn, which was received on 7 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Mr Casben was disarmingly honest in admitting that his failure to search the storage area earlier resulted from "a lack of commitment on my part".</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">In circumstances where Mr Casben made a conscious choice not to participate in the process, albeit one which he later revised, I am not satisfied that he should be included as a participant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Category H 
 
72 This category includes all members whose Proofs had not been received by 4.00 pm on 8 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">They are Richard Lewis , Rob Monahan Holdings Pty Ltd (Brian Hayes) , Constanze Hutchison , Michael Koon Lam Chan and Beck Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (Anthony Beck) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Their explanations, which are characterised by a lack of detail, range from being away when the Proof was requested, to not "being in the loop", or simply failing to deal with the matter promptly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">None submitted any supporting documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Their position is different from that of Geoffrey Stewart who, although he did not submit the formal Proof, provided all the relevant information; (see [42] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Mr Franklin did not make any submissions in support of the inclusion of these five members and, on the basis of the principles outlined above, I am not satisfied that these members should be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">73 In addition to the above, Maurice Blackburn received statements of reasons and/or Proofs after the 8 August 2008 deadline, including after the hearing on 14 August, from three members, namely Wayne Brian Leslie Wilson , Wayne Brian Leslie Wilson Superannuation Fund and Anston Pty Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The extent of their delay is such that, in my view, it is sufficient to justify their exclusion from the settlement group, and I will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Conclusion 
 
74 As explained above, I have determined, in accordance with principles that I have articulated, which of the Late Notified Holdings should not be excluded as group members participating in the settlement and which should.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">I have appended to these reasons, and the consequent orders, two schedules listing the members who, in accordance with these reasons, are not to be excluded as participants in the settlement (Schedule 1) and those who are (Schedule 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">It may be however, that overlap between, or inconsistency in, the documents tendered to the Court requires some amendments, consistent with the stated principles, to be made to the schedules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Consequently I shall allow the parties leave to apply for any variation of my orders by 12 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">I certify that the preceding seventy-four (74) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.</sentence>
