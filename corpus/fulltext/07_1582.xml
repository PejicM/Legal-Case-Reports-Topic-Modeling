<sentence id="s0">
 (First Court hearing) 
 
1 On 9 August 2007 the plaintiff and Bendigo Bank Limited (Bendigo Bank) jointly announced to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) their intention to merge their respective businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The merger is to be effected by way of schemes of arrangement whereby the Bendigo Bank will acquire all of the plaintiff's shares and the plaintiff will become a subsidiary of Bendigo Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The proposed schemes of arrangement require the approval of this Court pursuant to s 411 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) because it is a compromise or arrangement between a Part 5.1 body and its members and its classes of members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 The plaintiff has on issue three classes of shares, Ordinary Shares; Step Up Preference Shares; and Reset Preference Shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Separate schemes are proposed for each class of securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 The Ordinary Share Scheme is not conditional upon the Step Up Preference Share Scheme or the Reset Preference Share Scheme being approved by the holders of those securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, the Step Up Preference Share Scheme and the Reset Preference Share Scheme are each conditional upon the Ordinary Share Scheme being approved by the members holding the Ordinary Shares, although neither is conditional upon the other being approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 The plaintiff is a public company and one of Australia's top 150 companies listed on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It has a market capitalisation of approximately $1.6 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">As its name suggests, it is a bank which has as its principal banking activities the provision of mortgages, business loans, consumer loans, margin loans, savings and investment products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">As at 30 June 2007 it had assets of approximately $32.4 billion and loans under management of approximately $27.5 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">6 Bendigo Bank, which is also listed on the ASX, has a market capitalisation of approximately $2.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is one of Australia's top 100 companies listed on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is also, of course, a bank which provides a range of banking and other financial services to both retail customers and small to medium size businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It conducts similar but not the same activities as the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Its products are distributed through a retail network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 The Ordinary Share Scheme of the merger proposal involves the Ordinary Shareholders of the plaintiff receiving 1.075 shares in the new merged bank in exchange for each ordinary share they currently hold in the plaintiff company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 The Step Up Preference Share Scheme and the Reset Preference Share Scheme provide that the holders of those securities in the plaintiff will receive one fully paid Step Up Preference Share and one Reset Preference Share in the merged bank for each Step Up Preference Share or Reset Preference Share held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">9 The plaintiff and Bendigo Bank entered into a Merger Implementation Agreement on 9 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It was a term of that agreement that Bendigo Bank's obligations to the plaintiff's shareholders (of all classes) would be secured by Bendigo Bank entering into a deed poll which, in fact, it did on 3 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">10 The purpose of today's hearing is for the plaintiff to obtain orders under s 411 of the Corporations Act to convene meetings of the three classes of members and for the Court to approve the Explanatory Statement which is proposed to be sent to those members as required by s 412(1)(a) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Consequential orders are also sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">11 The plaintiff proposes that the three scheme meetings will take place separately on 12 November 2007 at the Adelaide Convention Centre, North Terrace, Adelaide, commencing with the Ordinary Share Scheme Meeting at 9.30 am, the Step Up Preference Share Scheme Meeting at 10.45 am and the Reset Preference Share Scheme Meeting at 11.30 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 I have been provided with the draft Explanatory Statement which has been described by the plaintiff as the Draft Scheme Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In this case, the plaintiff's solicitors provided me, in a timely fashion, with all the documents upon which the plaintiff intended to rely to allow me to study the necessary documents in advance of today's hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">13 The Court has a discretion to make the orders sought by the plaintiff where a plaintiff satisfies the criteria in s 411(1) itself and is not disqualified under s 411(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 411(1) is engaged where a Part 5.1 body has proposed a compromise or arrangement with its members or any class of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 I am satisfied that that criteria has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The plaintiff is a Part 5.1 body as defined in s 9 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">A scheme of arrangement of the kind proposed is a compromise or arrangement within the meaning of s 411: Re Bank of Adelaide (1979) 22 SASR 481.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Subject therefore to the other subsections of ss 411 and 412 , the plaintiff is entitled to seek the exercise of the Court's discretion and make the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">15 Two preconditions for the exercise of the power in s 411 are provided for in s 411(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">First, pursuant to s 411(2)(a) , the Court is not entitled to make an order under s 411(1) unless 14 days notice of the hearing of the application, or such lesser period of notice as the Court or ASIC permits, has been given to ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I am satisfied on the evidence that 14 days notice of the application has been given to ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 Secondly, s 411(2)(b) of the Corporations Act prevents the Court from making an order unless satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the terms of the proposed compromise or arrangement and to make submissions to the Court in relation to the proposed compromise or arrangement, and the draft Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">17 The Explanatory Statement was first provided to ASIC on 14 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The evidence discloses that ASIC has considered the Explanatory Statement over the period between 14 September and 4 October, and has required the plaintiff to make certain amendments to the Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">18 On 4 October 2007 ASIC advised the plaintiff in writing that "... after examining the documentation for each scheme ASIC does not currently propose to appear to make submissions, or intervene to oppose the schemes the first hearing of which is scheduled for Friday 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">"
 
19 I am therefore satisfied that ASIC has been given the opportunity required under s 411(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It follows that s 411(2) does not preclude the Court making the orders sought under s 411(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">20 There are two orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">First, an order for the convening of meetings and, secondly, an order approving the Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Both orders sought involve the exercise of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">21 In theory, the Court might make an order convening a meeting but refuse to make an order approving the Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">That, however, would be unlikely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">If the Court were not satisfied that the Explanatory Statement was appropriate to be sent to the members it would be unlikely to convene a meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">On the other hand, the Court would not approve the Explanatory Statement but refuse to convene a meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It follows, because in all but the most exceptional case the Court is called upon to make both orders, that the Court must be satisfied that the members will be fully informed so that they may make a fully informed decision on the proposals of the schemes of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">22 It is proposed that three separate meetings take place for the three separate classes of members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">That appears to me to be appropriate especially where, as is the case here, different benefits flow from the proposed merger to the different classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is also appropriate, having regard to the fact that the Step Up Preference Share Scheme Meeting and the Reset Preference Share Scheme Meeting are dependent upon the ordinary shareholders having first approved the scheme of arrangement insofar as they are affected at the first scheme meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It is appropriate that the three scheme meetings be held separately and sequentially as proposed by the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">23 I am satisfied that proper arrangements have been proposed for the holding of the three meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The evidence discloses that two of the present directors of the plaintiff have made themselves available as chair and alternative chair of those meetings and that those persons do not have any conflict of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">24 Of course, it is not the case that the Court is presently concerned to pass any final opinion on whether any of the schemes that are proposed should be approved: s 411(17) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">On the other hand, it would be unlikely that the Court would convene a meeting under s 411 unless it was satisfied that the nature of the compromise or arrangement, in this case a scheme of arrangement, is of such a kind that if it were to be approved by the members it would also be later approved by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In doing so, the Court does not make its own commercial judgment as to the appropriateness of the proposal in the schemes of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">That is a matter for the members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">25 Rather, at this first hearing, the Court needs to be satisfied that all of the statutory criteria have been met and that the proposed schemes of arrangement are legitimate commercial arrangements in the sense that they are not designed to avoid other provisions of the Corporations Act but are schemes of arrangement within the statutory concept of an arrangement or compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I am satisfied of both those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">26 The Court will have regard to the directors' recommendations and the independent expert's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In this case, the directors have unanimously recommended that the members approve the schemes and become shareholders in Bendigo Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">27 The plaintiff has obtained an independent expert's report from KPMG Partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Donald Manifold, an executive director of KPMG Corporate Finance (Aust) Pty Ltd, had the responsibility, together with two other employees of KPMG, of preparing separate reports in relation to the three separate schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In respect of each of the schemes, the authors opined that, in the absence of a superior proposal, on balance the schemes are in the best interests of the Adelaide Bank shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">28 The Court needs to be satisfied that the Explanatory Statement has sufficient information to allow the members to make a commercial judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It also has to be satisfied that the Explanatory Statement does not apparently contain any matter that is false or misleading in any material particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">29 I am satisfied that the plaintiff has negotiated each of the terms of the merger implementation agreement at arm's length with Bendigo Bank and that the terms which have been arrived at are commercially appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">30 On the hearing of this application today, Mr Bathurst QC, who led for the plaintiff, brought to my attention three particular aspects of the proposed schemes of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">First, he drew my attention to the exclusivity transaction and the "no shop/no talk" provision of the proposed merger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He also drew my attention to the fiduciary carve-out provision within the merger implementation agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The "no shop/no talk" provision is an unremarkable term commercially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It satisfies the criteria Santow J adduced in Re Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 758.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In my opinion, it is not a term which would make the proposed scheme of arrangement such that it ought not be submitted to its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">31 Secondly, he brought to my attention the terms of the agreement relating to a break fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In relation to the break fee, he emphasised that there was a break fee payable by both parties to the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Both the plaintiff and the Bendigo Bank must pay a break fee in the sum of $15 million if the transaction does not go ahead for any of the reasons given in the proposed scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The break fee is less than 1% of the plaintiff's market capitalisation of $1.6 billion which is within the Australian Takeovers Panel's Guidance Notes: Guidance Note 7: Lock-up Devices (2 nd issue, 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In any event, the break fee is not payable in circumstances where the members vote not to implement the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In those circumstances, the break fee is not a disincentive to the shareholders in their consideration of the proposed merger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">32 Lastly, he brought to my attention the provision in the agreement which deems the ordinary shareholder to have warranted to Bendigo Bank that their ordinary shares are fully paid and free from encumbrances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The purpose of the clause was adverted to by Lindgren J in Re APN News &amp; Media Limited (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [59]-[60]:
 
 59 In substance, the purpose of the deemed warranty is to prevent a shareholder whose shares are subject to encumbrances from receiving the same scheme consideration as that to be received by those whose shares are free from encumbrances, without any obligation, in effect, to refund to INMAL the amount required to discharge the encumbrance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It is not practicable for amounts secured by encumbrance to be deducted from the scheme consideration payable to the relevant scheme participants on the implementation date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">60 The warranty will be deemed to have been given, not only by those offeree shareholders who vote to agree to the scheme, and who, therefore, can be seen to be consenting to give it, but also those who do not vote at all or who vote against the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">However, I do not think that this matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">What is important, in my view, is that the deemed warranty is no more than a device directed to ensuring that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty is the amount required to discharge the encumbrance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">

33 All three matters raised by Mr Bathurst QC were addressed by Lindgren J in this Court in Re APN News and Media Limited 62 ACSR 400.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In all three instances, his Honour found that similar clauses in similar transactions were no bar to the implementation of the proposed transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">34 I am further satisfied that the directors have unanimously recommended the schemes of arrangement to all three classes of members of the plaintiff and that in doing so they have not acted otherwise than in accordance with their duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I am satisfied that an appropriate independent expert's report was obtained and that the opinion expressed is that held by the author.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">35 I am also satisfied that the plaintiff put in place a due diligence committee which has rigorously examined the proposed merger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">36 I am satisfied that proper consultation has been had with ASIC and that ASIC does not oppose the orders sought on this occasion for the convening of the meetings and the approval of the Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">37 The Explanatory Statement describes the merger implementation agreement and the proposed merger in sufficient detail so as to enable the members to make a fully informed decisions in relation to the proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I have not been able to detect any false or misleading statement within the Explanatory Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I am satisfied that the Explanatory Statement explains the effect of the schemes of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It discloses the directors' material interests as required under s 412(1)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It also sets out the information which is proscribed by reg 5.1.01 of the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) (the Regulations) and Schedule 8 of those Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">38 The criteria referred to by Emmett J in Re Central Pacific Minerals N.L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">[2002] FCA 239 and approved by Conti J in Re CSR Ltd (2003) 45 ACSR 34 at 36-37 have been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The plaintiff has conformed with Santow J's test in Re NRMA Insurance Ltd (2003) 33 ACSR 523.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">39 The plaintiff proposes to rely upon s 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 (US) (US Securities Act) for exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I therefore record, to facilitate that event occurring, that the Court has been advised that the Court's order will be relied upon for the purpose of s 3(a)(10) of the US Securities Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">40 I should, for completeness, mention one final matter lest it be thought it had been overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The proposal in the schemes of arrangement does not allow certain foreign resident shareholders to obtain the benefit of the shares offered by Bendigo Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Instead, in their case, if the schemes are implemented, the shares will be issued to a nominee and sold and the proceeds remitted to those foreign shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">That class of shareholders is less than 1% in each of the three classes of securities and therefore only comprise a small fraction of the shareholders in the three separate classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It seems to me that the manner in which those shareholders' interests are dealt with is appropriate having regard to the proposed transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">41 I am satisfied, as Conti J was in Re CSR Ltd 45 ACSR 34, that the marginally different treatment of the ineligible foreign shareholders does not raise an issue as to the proper formation of classes of members affected by the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">42 For those reasons, it would be appropriate to make the orders sought on the application and to appoint a further date for the consideration as to whether the Court should, if the members have so resolved, approve the schemes of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">43 For those reasons, I make the orders in the short minutes of order this day initialled by me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Associate:
