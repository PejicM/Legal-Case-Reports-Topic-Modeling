1 This is a matter in which the Registrar made an order on 16 December 2005 winding up British Finance Pty Ltd (ABN 52 096 757 836) (the company).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It is clear from the evidence that the order should not have been made because the evidence for the plaintiff was deficient as it did not take into account events concerning the payment of outstanding liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This lead to the affidavit upon which the order was made being incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">If the correct facts had been known then, no doubt, an order would not have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I should note that no creditor attended the hearing to support or oppose the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It also appears that the company did not become aware of the proceedings because of an error concerning its registered office so there was, in fact, a series of errors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I am satisfied from the evidence that, in any event, there is no reason to believe that the company is insolvent and, indeed, the evidence is to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 That being so, I have no doubt that the liquidation should be reversed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was put to me that one mechanism for doing this is for there to be a review of the Registrar's orders rather than for there to be an order terminating the winding up pursuant to s 482 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On reflection, it seems to me that in this matter a review can properly lead to a discharge of the orders in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I have set out the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They are unusual, and an order made upon an incorrect footing such as this should not be allowed to remain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There may be consequences in having an order made which is later terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 There is no practical difficulty in the present case because the liquidator's costs and legal costs are being paid and there are no other intervening third parties' interests at stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Therefore, I make the orders set out in the short minutes of order which I will place with the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Associate:
