 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Ultradrilling Pty Ltd ("Ultradrilling") was engaged by West International Pty Ltd ("West") as a subcontractor to carry out extensive drilling works on a project on the Kingston Foreshore, Lake Burley Griffin, in the Australian Capital Territory ("the Project").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Ultradrilling issued seven invoices to West for that work totalling $345,983.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 13 March 2008, Ultradrilling issued an amended statement of account for $333,036.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">West paid $102,507.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The balance, $230,529.00, was the amount sought by Ultradrilling in a statutory demand dated 9 May 2008 with an accompanying affidavit dated 9 May 2008 ("the Statutory Demand").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 On receipt of the Statutory Demand, West paid $75,132.00 and applied to set aside the balance of the Statutory Demand ($155,397.00) on two grounds in s 459H(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"): (1) there was a genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the debt (as to $47,916.00); and (2) West had an "offsetting claim" (in the sum of $120,420.00).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 On 18 July 2008, pursuant to s 459H(4) Registrar Hetyey varied the Statutory Demand to $57,339.00, having accepted that there was a genuine dispute as to $47,916.00 and offsetting claims to the value of $50,142.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">West now applies to the Court to review that decision pursuant to s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Federal Court Act "), contending that the Registrar erred in rejecting the balance of its offsetting claim, the acceptance of which would require setting aside of the Statutory Demand in its entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 As these reasons for decision will demonstrate, the Statutory Demand must be set aside in its entirety under s 459H(3) of the Act on the grounds that there is a genuine dispute about the existence or amount of part of the debt and in relation to the balance of the debt, West has offsetting claims which exceed the amount of that debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">NATURE OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
5 Before turning to the facts, it is necessary to restate some relevant principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 The function of the Court, on review of a Registrar's decision under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court Act , is to rehear the case and decide the facts for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is a hearing de novo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That is to say, it is a complete rehearing at which the parties may adduce further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is for the Court to be satisfied of the matters prescribed by the Act and to exercise the discretion unfettered by the decision of the Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The cases that make good those propositions include: Mazukov v University of Tasmania [2004] FCAFC 159 at [22] - [27] ; and Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) 217 ALR 634 at [6] and [12] and Callegher v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 239 ALR 749 at [46].</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 The principles to be applied by the Court in determining an application to set aside a statutory demand are also not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ultradrilling and West about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates: s 459H(1)(a) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That issue is determined at the time the Court hears the application: Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 at [16] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">For a genuine dispute to exist, the dispute must "be bona fide and truly exist in fact".</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute must be "real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived": Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G&amp;M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 464; see also John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 250 at 253 and TR Administration Pty Ltd v Frank Marchetti &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [2008] VSCA 70 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 67 at 79.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact or determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at [40] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Court determines only whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by West depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As Young J said in John Holland Construction 14 ACSR at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required: see also Micha International Pty Limited v Jong Seol Lee [2008] NSWSC 921 at [5] and Solarite Air Conditioning Pty Ltd v York International Australia Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 411 at [23] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 The test to be applied in determining whether an offsetting claim exists is the same as that applied in ascertaining the existence of a genuine dispute: TR Administration Pty Ltd 66 ACSR at 79.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">GENUINE DISPUTE AND OFFSETTING CLAIMS 
 
10 As noted earlier, Ultradrilling was engaged by West as a subcontractor on the Project to undertake extensive drilling work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">West in turn had been hired by head contractor Macmahon Contractors Pty Ltd ("Macmahon").</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Statutory Demand issued by Ultradrilling claims an amount that is said to represent the balance due to it from West for the drilling work done pursuant to the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The genuine dispute alleged by West is whether certain amounts are in fact payable and owing under the contract; the offsetting claim is for losses said to arise out of Ultradrilling's breach of the contract due to its delay in completing the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Genuine Dispute 
 
11 West contends that of the $155,397 remaining unpaid on the Statutory Demand, there is a genuine dispute in relation to $47,916 arising from excessive and incorrect charges by Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">12 The amount of $47,916, in fact, is said to be comprised of three separate amounts - namely:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">$21,659, being Ultradrilling's claim for the "additional cost of run casing and gravel pack";
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">$7,623, being Ultradrilling's claim for the cost of signing in and out of the site; and
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">$18,634, being Ultradrilling's claim for "other standby" charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I propose to deal with each amount separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Additional cost of run casing and gravel pack - $21,659 
 
13 West contended that all of the works to be carried out by Ultradrilling were set out in a purchase order dated 13 June 2007 from West to Ultradrilling ("the Purchase Order").</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That Purchase Order described the work to be undertaken as follows:

<sentence id="s44">) 
14 Ultradrilling's claim of $21,659 for the "additional cost of run casing and gravel pack" was the subject of correspondence between Ultradrilling and West dated 15 February 2008 and 10 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">At that time, there was no dispute that Ultradrilling was obliged to supply the run casing and gravel packs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, West did dispute that Ultradrilling was entitled to claim the additional cost for transporting the run casing and gravel packs from the storage areas to the drilling holes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In its letter of 15 February 2008, West described it as one of the "non-approved charges" by Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">15 As West's letter of 15 February pointed out, Ultradrilling was engaged to drill bore holes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">West contended that to do that involved bringing the necessary equipment from the storage area to the hole sites and laying the equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">That is, West disputed that the carting of goods from a storage location to a site was an additional cost entitled to be claimed by Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The italicised terms of the Purchase Order (see [13] above) provide objective evidence that there is a genuine dispute, for the whole of the amount of $21,659, about whether Ultradrilling was entitled to charge separately for transporting the run casing and gravel packs from the storage areas to the drilling holes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">16 Before leaving this item, it is important to recall that Ultradrilling accepted there was a genuine dispute in relation to this item but limited to $8,712.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Consistent with the authorities (see [8] above) and the view I have expressed in paras [14] and [15] above, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to seek to reconcile the invoices issued by Ultradrilling to resolve the quantum of the amount in fact in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is the entitlement of Ultradrilling to in fact charge separately for the whole of the run casing and gravel pack "additional cost" of $21,659 which is the genuine dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Signing in and signing out - $7,623 
 
17 Ultradrilling charged West $7,623 for signing in and out of the site each day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The amount was calculated on the basis that the time taken by the workers to sign in and out each day was half an hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Ultradrilling conceded that the Statutory Demand should be reduced by this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Other standby - $18,634 
 
18 Ultradrilling claimed $18,634 for what was described as "other standby" charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">West disputed Ultradrilling's entitlement to claim this amount on the grounds that the standby arose because of problems caused by Ultradrilling "that required the new or further instructions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">19 One of the variation items identified on the Purchase Order (see [13]) above) was "Standby rate awaiting per instructions: AUD $220/Hour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In other words, West accepted that if a contractor specifically requested the subcontractor to standby pending further instructions, the subcontractor was entitled to charge an hourly rate but argued that the rate was not able to be claimed where the subcontractor had itself caused the problem which necessitated the need for further instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">20 Mr Stephen Mark West, a director of West, identified four incidents --- Ultradrilling's alleged failure to perform work to correct specifications, the incident of spoil entering the lake and two purported breaches of safety requirements --- which he alleged gave rise to the need to place Ultradrilling on standby pending further instructions and that each incident was caused by Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">21 Counsel for Ultradrilling submitted that when the invoices identifying claims for "other standby" were analysed, it was apparent that many of the 31 claims over a period of three to four months could not have been caused by the actions of Ultradrilling and that, at best, only a few hours could said to result from the actions of Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That is to say, Ultradrilling's counsel conceded for the purposes of argument in this case as to whether the Statutory Demand should be set aside (but not for the purposes of any substantive claim or counterclaim in a future proceeding for breach of contract) that "under the contract if the standby is caused by the actions of [Ultradrilling], then it is not chargeable" and thus the assertion about Ultradrilling being the cause of the need to standby was sufficient to give rise to a genuine dispute as to whether some part of the "other standby" amount was in fact chargeable and owing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In other words, Ultradrilling accepted that the assertions and evidence supplied by Mr West in his affidavit might be sufficient to establish a genuine dispute, but argued that the amount of the genuine dispute was not the full $18,634 but instead some lesser sum of money which West had failed to particularise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">22 I reject Ultradrilling's "failure to particularise" contention on a number of bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">First, it cannot be said that when Mr West identified incidents allegedly caused by Ultradrilling and giving rise to the need to place Ultradrilling on standby pending further instructions, he was purporting to give a complete list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">So much is made clear by the language of para [12] of his affidavit of 29 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Secondly, it is apparent from the contemporaneous correspondence before the Court that Macmahon itself attributed delays on the Project to what it described as "lack of production" by Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In those circumstances and having regard to the nature of the incidents identified, it is neither possible nor appropriate for a Court in a proceeding of this nature to seek an exhaustive list of each incident, determine its cause, and then ascertain the time and cost of any such delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is objective evidence that there is a genuine dispute about whether Ultradrilling was entitled to charge separately for "other standby" for the whole of the amount of $18,634.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Put another way, contrary to the submissions of Ultradrilling, it cannot be said that the dispute as to the whole of the amount is a "patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence": Rhagodia Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd (2008) 67 ACSR 367 at [93] (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There is "sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation" as to the truth of the assertion: Rhagodia at [93] (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Offsetting claims 
 
23 As noted earlier, West contended that it also had offsetting claims of $120,420 against Ultradrilling based on Ultradrilling's alleged delay in completing the drilling work that was said to constitute a breach of the contract between West and Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The losses arising from the breach were said by Mr West in his 29 May affidavit to comprise:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">$18,152 for internal administrative costs;
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">$31,990 short payment from Macmahon; and
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">$70,278 for other delay costs incurred by West.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">24 Before turning to consider these amounts, it is necessary to say something about the general nature and alleged cause of the offsetting claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There is no dispute that the Project was delayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">As noted earlier, what is in dispute is the cause of the delays and, having determined the cause, the precise costs resulting from those delays and their recoverability under the contract (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">whether the delays constitute breaches of one or more terms of the contract).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Some of the costs said to arise from the delays I have already considered (see [18] to [22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">25 West argues that Ultradrilling was the cause of Project delays and that the amounts specified by West are the costs attributable to those delays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There is, on any view, sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">That evidence includes, but is not limited to, a letter from Macmahon to West dated 7 February 2008 which not only referred to the fact that delays had been incurred on the Project as a result of the lack of production by Ultradrilling but attached what was described as a "delay schedule".</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The schedule set out a series of dates and the time lost and the "[r]eason for the [d]elay" in relation to those specific dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The delays listed on the schedule totalled 256 hours; Mr West in his 29 May affidavit alleged that the Ultradrilling delays effectively amounted to 27 working days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The schedule's "reason for the delay" column included items such as "Driller left at midday due to sickness --- smelt of alcohol", "Finished at 2:00pm", "Not on site", "[D]idn't arrive until 11", and "Driller left early".</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">26 This objective evidence raises a number of issues, including: (1) whether the cause of each delay recorded on each date was as described; (2) whether the delays were a result of Ultradrilling's conduct; (3) if so, the precise number of hours of and costs attributable to each delay; and finally, (4) the basis on which West is entitled to recover all or part of those costs from Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">27 In oral submissions, counsel for Ultradrilling appeared to accept the existence of a genuine dispute as to the first three issues - that is, whether there were delays, who caused them, and the amount of the costs resulting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Counsel nevertheless submitted that these offsetting claims based on delay should be rejected because the contract between Ultradrilling and West contained no express stipulations about time for completion of the contract and that any legal argument in favour of there being an implied term or terms in the contract covering all of the delays set out in the schedule to the letter dated 7 February 2008 (see [25] above) was "patently feeble".</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I reject Ultradrilling's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">28 There is sufficient objective evidence to establish a prima facie allegation of delay on the part of Ultradrilling caused by its own conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is important to note that Ultradrilling's contentions proceeded not on the basis that there could be no implied term relating to time but that the legal argument there existed one or more implied terms covering all of the instances set out in the schedule to the letter dated 7 February 2008 was "patently feeble".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That contention is understandable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">However, the evidence before the Court on these issues (including the terms of the contract) is not exhaustive: cf TR Administration 66 ACSR at 81-82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Indeed, what evidence was before the Court suggested that there was in fact no formal, integrated written contract, but instead a series of emails, purchase orders, and invoices, including the Purchase Order partially set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">29 Particularly in those circumstances, the nature and extent of any implied term is not necessarily a straightforward issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It would first require consideration of the express terms of the contract, which in the absence of an integrated written contract would themselves have to be discerned from the various correspondence, documents, and possibly oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The exercise would also no doubt require consideration of the relevance and application of the principle of construction that in particular types of commercial contracts, punctual performance and reasonable diligence may be implied conditions of the contract: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I Bailey, "Construction Law in Australia" (2 nd ed 1998) at 122-25; 5 Bruner &amp; O'Connor on Construction Law (2008) s 15:17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In short, while some or maybe even all of West's delay claims may ultimately fail, they present issues which cannot be and should not be resolved in this application by what would amount to a mini-trial on the underlying contract claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Such issues must instead await any substantive breach of contract proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">30 For present purposes, I am satisfied that an offsetting claim with sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation does exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It now remains only to consider the amount of that claim, and whether it is such as to justify the setting aside of the Statutory Demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">For that, I turn to examine the three components said by West to constitute the offsetting claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Internal administrative costs 
 
31 The first component, internal administrative costs of $18,152, is said to be costs incurred by West as a result of the incidents referred to above (see [25]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Mr West alleged that, as a result of the delays, West needed to employ four staff, including himself, for five weeks longer than required, with associated accommodation costs for those staff who were not located in the Australian Capital Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The names of the staff, together with their hourly rate, the hours worked and the total claim amount, were set out in Mr West's 29 May 2008 affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">A claim of this nature was first raised by Mr West with Ultradrilling in his letter of 15 February 2008, to which I have already referred (see [14]-[15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Having regard to the matters referred to in [25] and [26] above and the contents of Mr West's affidavit, there is a genuine offsetting claim of sufficient factual particularity in relation to this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Alleged short payment 
 
32 The second component concerns an alleged short payment of $31,990 from Macmahon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is not an additional cost incurred by West but a claim made by West against Ultradrilling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Counsel for Ultradrilling submitted that the objective evidence discloses that there was in fact no short payment but a delay in the payment, for an unspecified period of time, from Macmahon to West.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It is therefore necessary to consider that objective evidence to determine whether or not it establishes a prima facie offsetting claim of the nature and size described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">33 The starting point again is the letter of 15 February 2008 from West to Ultradrilling (referred to at [14] and [15] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It listed one of West's claims against Ultradrilling as a "short payment from Macmahon as a result of delays" of $31,990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The objective evidence establishes that West settled its own contract dispute with Macmahon on terms that required it to forgo claims totalling $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It is by no means clear whether: (1) the $31,990 allegedly withheld is, in fact, part of the $100,000 that West had to forgo as part of its settlement with Macmahon; and (2) if so, the amount is recoverable under the West-Ultradrilling contract as consequential damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In the end, however, the issues raised in paras [28]-[30] above are again directly relevant to the Court's consideration of this aspect of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">There is a genuine offsetting claim in relation to this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The merits of that claim are to be determined in another forum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Other delay costs of at least $70,278 
 
34 As the label suggests, the third component is for other costs allegedly caused by Ultradrilling's delays in the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">35 This component was rejected by the Deputy Registrar on the grounds that there "[was] simply no evidence (credible or otherwise) before the [C]ourt to explain how this offsetting claim [was] said to arise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a result, on review West filed additional affidavit material (as it was entitled to do) from Mr West seeking to rectify that problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">That evidence was described as disclosing "the actual costs associated with the delay caused by [Ultradrilling] and not otherwise covered by the claims permitted by the Deputy District Registrar".</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Those actual costs, which at $101,458.70 exceeded the previous, estimated figure of $70,278, were itemised as follows:
 
 
 Calculation of Actual Costs 
 Incurred and associated with the 27 days lost
 5.4 weeks
 
 Payroll 
 Engineer 1 7,470.00
 Engineer 2 5,659.00
 Engineer 3 6,800.00
 Allowance paid to engineers 1,620.00
 Accommodation 4,750.00
 Transport 2,350.00
 
 Compressor 4,000.00
 
 Lost mark up 
 on engineer's costs at 30% 9,794.00
 
 Lost profit on 29 pumps usually
 rented at $110 per day and left
 idle for 37 days allowing for
 costs estimated at 50% 59,015.00
 
 TOTAL 101,458.70 
 
 

36 The additional affidavit from Mr West went on to describe these claims in the following terms:
 
 
 In that period [of 27 days] [West] was required to retain 3 engineers, with accommodation and transport and pay them a per day sustenance allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The period also required the retention of a compressor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In that period the engineers and the pumps could have been employed on other projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">If so employed [West] would have recovered approximately a further 30% on the costs as a profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">During the delay some 29 pumps were idle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">If the pumps were used elsewhere they would usually be rented out at $110 per day (each day not just working days).</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If rented out, [West] would incur costs of about 50% of the rent recovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 

37 Ultradrilling submitted that the fact that West now puts forward these details of the offsetting claim to overcome the difficulties identified by the Deputy Registrar should tell strongly against the genuineness of the claim, both on the issue of whether the delays are recoverable by West against Ultradrilling and the amount of any such claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In any event, Ultradrilling contends that the evidence now provided does not rise above mere assertion and should be rejected on that basis alone: see Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd v MacDougal [2004] NSWSC 560 at [18] - [19] and TR Administration 66 ACSR at 79-80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Ultradrilling focused, in particular, on the charges for "lost mark up" and the "lost profit" on the pumps (see [35] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Ultradrilling contended that if, as was required, a line was drawn to distinguish between evidence that was merely spurious, bluster or assertion and evidence which provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile, the offsetting claim would be dismissed: TR Administration at 79-80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">38 I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">What this application has demonstrated is that the terms on which West engaged Ultradrilling to drill bore holes and the manner in which Ultradrilling completed that work is the subject of dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Those issues cannot be resolved and should not be resolved in the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Moreover, it must be recalled that West is not required to establish the precise dollars and cents or provide a fully evidenced claim: Elm Financial Services at [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">39 Secondly, the bases on which Ultradrilling contends that charges for "lost mark up" and the "lost profit" on the pumps are spurious cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">"Lost mark up" was criticised by Ultradrilling on the grounds that "[t]he sense in which this amount was 'lost' [was] unexplained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">" However, that loss was explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">In Mr West's additional affidavit and accompanying spreadsheet (see [35]-[36] above), it was described as the margin which West would have received on the engineer's labour - that is, the difference between the rate charged to the client and the rate actually paid to the engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Whether such loss is recoverable from Ultradrilling and if so, whether 30% is the correct rate to apply in calculating the loss, are issues to be determined in other forums.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The other loss, the "lost profit" component, was challenged by Ultradrilling on the basis that because the pumps were said to be custom-built for the Project, there could be no "usual practice" for renting the pumps and it was not plausible to assume that each of the pumps, if not required on the Project, would have been immediately rented out for the whole period to a third party at $110 per day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Again, those are issues that will need to be resolved in another forum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">40 In the present case, it cannot be said that the evidence was merely spurious, bluster or assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The evidence ultimately provided by West provided sufficient factual particularity to exclude the merely fanciful or futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Whether West will succeed at any trial of the issue is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">ORDERS 
 
41 Adding together the $47,916 in genuine dispute and the approximately $151,610 in offsetting claims yields a total amount which exceeds the balance of $155,397 claimed by Ultradrilling pursuant to the Statutory Demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In the circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the Statutory Demand be set aside under s 459H(3) of the Act and that Ultradrilling pay West's costs of and incidental to the application, both before the Registrar and this Court, such costs to be taxed in default of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">42 In view of those orders, it is unnecessary to separately consider setting aside the Statutory Demand on one or more of the grounds set out in s 459J of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I certify that the preceding forty-two (42) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Associate:
