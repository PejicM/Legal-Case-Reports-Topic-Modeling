<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules that certain costs ordered to be payable by the respondents in this matter be assessed as a gross sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The orders were made on 27 February 2006 ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] ATPR 42-103 , [2006] FCA 146 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] ATPR 42-104 , [2006] FCA 157).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Order 42 provided that the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh respondents pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings including all reserved costs, except those costs provided by order 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Order 43 provided that the third and fourth respondents pay the applicant's costs of the hearing on 10, 25 and 26 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 There were some formalities to be proved in relation to service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I have read the affidavits provided in relation to service and I am satisfied that each of the relevant respondents, that is, the third, fourth, fifth and sixth respondents, have, in the relevant sense, received notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The seventh respondent is not proceeded against and the first two respondents are companies in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">There is a complication in that the third and fourth respondents are each bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I am satisfied that service has been effected upon the relevant trustee in bankruptcy in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 In the events which have happened, none of the respondents have appeared to oppose the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The trustee in bankruptcy of the fourth respondent has appeared and indicated that there is no opposition to the orders, neither is there any consent to the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I will come back to the question of bankruptcy in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 The substance of the evidence in relation to the application for lump sum costs is the affidavit of Ms Deborah Susan Vine-Hall, a well-experienced expert in the preparation of bills of costs, taxation of bills of costs and the assessment of costs generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I have read the report that she prepared in this matter and I am satisfied that it reveals, first, a sound methodology for assessing the costs which would be taxable against the respondents and, second, that the methodology has been applied to the particular circumstances in an appropriate fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The report is very detailed and is self-explanatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Ms Vine-Hall's affidavit, exhibiting that report, needs no summary on my part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I note that it includes a method of arriving at what might be called a discount from the costs which may be payable to reflect the exigencies of the rules as to what is recoverable for party and party costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That is a difficult topic and, in the absence of any opposition, I am satisfied that the methodology that she proposes is acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 The principles which govern the application and the circumstances under which this rule is to be applied were dealt with by Lehane J in Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc [2000] FCA 628 particularly at [22]---[27]; and by Sackville J in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [2007] FCA 2059 , particularly at [16] and [25]---[34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I need not repeat those principles here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I am satisfied that Ms Vine-Hall's assessment is in accordance with the principles reflected in those passages from those judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I am therefore satisfied as to the merits of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 There is the complication of intervening bankruptcies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is submitted that this situation falls within the category discussed by the majority of the High Court in Foots v Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 56 ; (2007) 241 ALR 32 , (2007) 5 ABC(NS) 419 at [35], [36] and [67].</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">As here, the order was made before bankruptcy ensued and, therefore, even though not quantified, the debt is provable in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, that means that, generally speaking, one cannot pursue a matter in court against the debtor once bankruptcy ensues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The appropriate thing to do is to file a proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Recognising that this is likely to be the position, the applicant seeks leave to proceed against both of the trustees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I am satisfied that both trustees have knowledge of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">One, as I have said, has appeared and does not oppose leave; the other, having been given notice of the application, responded that he did not propose to appear in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Those trustees have not formally been made parties to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel submits that leave should be granted and the matter proceed today for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I should note that the lump sum order which I propose to make will be made in relation to the fifth and sixth respondents in any event and, thus, I have had to consider the merits of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">7 To lodge a proof of debt in each of the bankrupt estates would, first of all, require a proof of debt to be prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Secondly, it would require the trustee to consider that proof of debt and that would require some investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">All of that seems to me to be time and money which should not be spent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It is unlikely to be recovered from anybody and, as the Court has had to do the work, it seems pointless to have it repeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">None of the relevant parties appear to oppose the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It seems to me that there will be unnecessary duplication if leave is not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Furthermore, the quantification of costs, the question that arises here, is very much a matter for the Court and Court officials and those with the knowledge of the way these things are done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The trustees in bankruptcy would have no particular qualifications to assess the situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">So as a matter of substance, I am satisfied that the orders should be made as sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">8 I have raised with counsel the question of the trustees not being parties to the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The grant of leave to proceed against the named individual respondents is probably sufficient for the technicalities to be observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is then for the trustees to deal with the result which ensues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">If this occasions any difficulty, or if there is any need for any further order, I will grant special liberty to apply to the trustees of the bankrupt estates of the third and fourth respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">9 For those reasons, I make orders (1) to (3) in the proposed orders which I have initialled and there will be a further order (4):
 
(4) Special liberty is reserved to the trustees in bankruptcy of the third and fourth respondents respectively to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Associate:
