1 The appellant appeals the whole of the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The federal magistrate had dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice dated 3 November 2006 ('the Notice') in respect of a debt (inclusive of interest) of $619,757.22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The issue in this appeal concerns the manner in which the Notice was completed in respect of the calculation of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant argued that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of the prescribed form because the Notice contained no statement of the principal sum, the period, or the interest rate or rates at which the interest had been claimed by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The background to the incurring of the judgment debt and the claim for interest is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 12 June 2003, Master Wheeler of the Supreme Court of Victoria entered judgment against the appellant in favour of the respondent in the sum of $569,589.65 in proceeding number 6302 of 2000 ('the 2003 Orders').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 In proceeding number 5407 of 2005, Whelan J of the Supreme Court of Victoria made orders on 31 October 2006 ('the 2006 Orders') in the following terms: 
 
 (1) The Court declares that the judgment obtained by the plaintiff in proceeding number 6302 of 2000 remains enforceable and that the sum of $619,757.22 remains outstanding as at 11 October 2006 pursuant to the said judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 (2) There is no order as to costs in relation to all aspects of the proceeding not already the subject of a costs order, including the costs of the amendments made during the trial which but for this order would be dealt with by Rule 63.17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">

5 On 3 November 2006, the Notice was issued and on 16 November 2006, it was served on the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 5 December 2006, the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the Notice.</sentence>

 (NB: If different rates are claimed for different periods, full details must be shown) 

7 The calculation of the interest claimed in item 3 of the schedule was set out by the respondent in a document attached to the Notice in the following terms: 
 
 CALCULATION OF INTEREST CLAIMED IN ITEM 3 OF THE SCHEDULE 
 
 Interest is claimed pursuant to Section 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 which provides: 
 
 
 
 "Every judgment debt carries interest at the rate for the time being fixed under Section 2 of the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 from the time the judgement was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">"
 
 
 
 By an order made by the Honourable Justice Whelan in the Supreme Court of Victoria, in proceeding number 5407 of 2005 the court declared that the judgement in proceeding 6302 of 2000 remains enforceable and that the sum of $619,757.22 remains outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 The sum of $619,757.22 includes interest in the sum of $190,167.57 pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

8 Annexed to the Notice were the 2003 Orders and 2006 Orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As indicated above, the 2006 Orders included a declaration of the debt owing by the appellant to the respondent as at 11 October 2006 inclusive of interest, being the sum of $619,757.22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It was not disputed that the declaration of Whelan J was binding on the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It would appear that the amount of interest was in fact agreed between the parties in the proceeding before Whelan J, as was noted by the federal magistrate (at [8]):
 
 In this case the respondent has not produced a schedule explaining how the figure set out in the declaration by Whelan J was calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Indeed, it appears that Whelan J reached that figure as a result of admissions made in the pleadings (the respondent alleged that the judgment debt together with interest as at 12 October 2006 was the sum of $619,757.22, and this allegation was admitted by the applicant in the defence).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There is now some dispute as to whether or not this figure is calculated precisely in accord with the relevant statutory provisions that apply to judgments of this type in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, it is conceded that the declaration of Whelan J is binding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">There has been no appeal, nor is it sought to look behind that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

Neither party contended before me that these observations of his Honour were inaccurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">LEGISLATION 
 
9 It is convenient to set out the relevant statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 40(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act') so far as is relevant, provides:
 
 A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (g) if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed, has served on the debtor in Australia or, by leave of the Court, elsewhere, a bankruptcy notice under this Act and the debtor does not: 
 
 
 
 (i) where the notice was served in Australia - within the time specified in the notice; or 
 (ii) where the notice was served elsewhere - within the time fixed for the purpose by the order giving leave to effect the service; 
 
 
 
 comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the Court that he or she has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order, as the case may be, being a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand that he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained; 
 
 

10 Section 41 of the Act, so far as is relevant, provides: 
 
 (1) An Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor: 
 (a) a final judgment or final order that: 
 
 (i) is of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and 
 (ii) is for an amount of at least $2,000; or 
 
 (b) 2 or more final judgments or final orders that: 
 
 
 
 (i) are of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and 
 (ii) taken together are for an amount of at least $2,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The notice must be in accordance with the form prescribed by the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 
 
 (3) A bankruptcy notice shall not be issued in relation to a debtor: 
 
 
 
 (a) except on the application of a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order within the meaning of paragraph 40(1)(g) or a person who, by virtue of paragraph 40(3)(d), is to be deemed to be such a creditor; 
 ... 
 
 

11 Regulation 4.02 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) ('the Regulations') provides:
 
 
 (1) For the purposes of subsection 41(2) of the Act, the form of bankruptcy notice set out in Form 1 is prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 (2) A bankruptcy notice must follow Form 1 in respect of its format (for example, bold or italic typeface, underlining and notes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) Subregulation (2) is not to be taken as expressing an intention contrary to s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 

12 Section 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ('the Acts Interpretation Act ') provides:
 
 Where an Act prescribes a form, then, unless the contrary intention appears, strict compliance with the form is not required and substantial compliance is sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

13 Section 306(1) of the Act provides:
 
 Proceedings under this Act are not invalidated by a formal defect or an irregularity, unless the court before which the objection on that ground is made is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 CONSIDERATION 
 
14 In order to determine the issues in this appeal, it is useful to refer to the recent decision of Snelgrove v Roskell (2007) 157 FCR 313.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In that case, Jacobson J considered whether an incorrect reference to the legislation, which was the statutory source of post-judgment interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice, resulted in the bankruptcy notice being invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In determining the correct principles to apply, his Honour held (at [29]-[31]):
 
 The High Court said in Adams [ v Lambert (2006)] [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [18] that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Act or the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 Cth (the Regulations), the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">If it is, it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71, and applied in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [25] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson 165 CLR at 79; Adams 225 ALR 396 at [25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

15 Apart from the reference to the Regulations in the last paragraph (to which see Gyles J at [113] in The Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2000) 109 FCR 33 referred to later which correctly indicates that the task is to focus on the Act not the Regulations), in my view Jacobson J correctly states the matters relevant to the inquiry whether the defect or irregularity in the Notice is a formal defect or an irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">16 However, a preliminary matter to consider is whether the Notice was defective or irregular in any event by reason of a failure to include an interest calculation in accordance with note 2, having regard to the circumstances of this case and to the operation of s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This preliminary matter was raised by the respondent, the federal magistrate having found, in favour of the appellant, that there was a relevant defect or irregularity in the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">17 If there was such a defect or irregularity, then the only remaining issue that I have been asked to determine is whether the Notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The appellant did not contend that the failure to include an interest calculation could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the Notice, but said that this was not relevant to determining whether there was a failure to comply with a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The relevant inquiry as described by Jacobson J consists of two aspects, which need to be addressed separately, and to the extent the federal magistrate treated both aspects together, in my respectful view he fell into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">18 However, I turn first to the preliminary matter as to whether the Notice substantially complied with the requirements of the form prescribed by the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In my view, the Notice does provide an equivalent to the required details of the calculation of the interest claimed as is necessary and prescribed, in the unusual circumstances surrounding the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">19 The following information is contained in or can be derived from the Notice:
 
 &#8226; The 2003 Orders were made on 12 June 2003 in the amount of $569,589.65 which was the principal sum of the final judgment debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">&#8226; Interest which accrued since the date of the 2003 Orders was claimed pursuant to s 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) ('the Supreme Court Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">&#8226; Interest was determined by the Supreme Court of Victoria on the basis of the rate set by the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic) ('the PIR Act') from the date of the 2003 Orders to 11 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">&#8226; The 2006 Orders were made on 31 October 2006 and the sum of $619,757.22 remained payable by the appellant to the respondent as at 11 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">&#8226; The sum of $619,757.22 included the interest claimed in the sum of $190,167.57 pursuant to the PIR Act and according to the calculation made by the binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">&#8226; No further interest was claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

20 It is true that in the document attached to the Notice the principal sum on which the interest is claimed is not separately identified (although it can be easily derived from the information available), and no actual rate of interest is identified other than by reference to the Supreme Court Act and the PIR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">However, the form prescribed by the Regulations is to adapt to the actual interest claim being made in each bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is not necessary in all situations to do an arithmetic calculation or to compute mathematically, and the reference to "details of calculation", whilst normally envisaging such a calculation or computation, do not necessarily exclude the details being provided in the way provided in this case, having regard to the interest that was claimed and the way in which it was derived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In this case, the respondent adapted the form to the unusual circumstances and in my view there has been substantial compliance with the prescribed form, which is sufficient (see s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
21 Substantial compliance is a matter of degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The court is concerned to look to the practical effect of what has been provided by way of information and the practical effect of what the form sought to achieve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The binding declaratory order has in effect provided the determination or calculation of the interest claimed and in this way details equivalent to the calculation of the amount of interest claimed have been provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In the usual case one would expect to see a setting out of the principal sum and the exact rate applied over the period of time in which interest is claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">However, if the interest has already been determined and calculated (in this case by a court), then it seems to me that for the purposes of note 2, by referring to the declaratory orders and providing the information set out above, the equivalent to the details of the calculation are provided to the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In fact, there was probably no better or appropriate way to detail the interest claim, as both parties were bound by the 2006 Orders so far as the calculation of interest was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I do not consider it was incumbent upon the respondent to set out an explanation as to how the figure in the declaratory order of the 2006 Orders was arrived at --- the declaratory order itself was a sufficient statement of the interest and how it was derived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">22 Therefore, I consider the federal magistrate was not correct to conclude that there was a failure to comply with the prescribed form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In my view, there was substantial compliance with the form and on this preliminary basis the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">23 As detailed argument has been presented to me on the remaining issue, whilst it is unnecessary for me to do so, it is convenient to nevertheless consider and determine that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I observe that this question must be considered on the assumption that substantial compliance has not been achieved, for if it had, then there would be no relevant defect or irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">24 If then the requirement as alleged by the appellant was made essential by the Act, there being no substantial compliance, failure to comply will result in the invalidity of the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">25 In determining what is an essential requirement one is guided by the High Court in Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 at [25] - [26] :
 
 In some cases the answer to that question may be easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In others, a difficult question of judgment may be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The matter for judgment was identified by this court in Kleinwort Benson [165 CLR 71] at 79-81.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In that case, the majority contrasted the concept of a formal defect or irregularity with a defect or irregularity that renders a bankruptcy notice a nullity that cannot be saved by s 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">To describe a defect as merely formal, or to describe a notice as a nullity, is, of course, to state a conclusion, rather than the reason for reaching that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Even so, it is necessary to identify the question that arises for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The majority, referring to James [ v FCT [1955] HCA 75 ; (1955) 93 CLR 631] at 644 , and Pillai v Comptroller of Income Tax [1970] AC 1124 at 1135 , summarised the exclusionary aspect of the meaning of "a formal defect or an irregularity" by saying [at 79] : 
 
 
 
 The authorities show that a bankruptcy notice is a nullity if it fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Act, or if it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 
 
 The question of construction raised by the words "a formal defect or an irregularity" is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole Act, informed by the general purpose of the legislation, and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is similar to the question that, in former times, would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [(1998) [1998] HCA 28 ; 194 CLR 355 at 390-391] it was said: 
 
 
 
 A better test ... is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of [a] provision should be invalid ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to "the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">" 
 

26 The High Court then considered whether the defect constituted a breach of an essential requirement of the Act (at [28]-[30]) (footnotes omitted):
 
 The other exclusionary aspect of the expression "a formal defect or an irregularity" in s 306 was said to consist in a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Here again, the word "essential", in its application in a particular case, involves a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">If a requirement is made essential by the Act, then a failure to meet that requirement is not a formal defect or an irregularity within the meaning of s 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Whether a requirement is made essential is to be decided by a process of statutory construction undertaken in the manner described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The majority in Lewis [109 FCR 33] regarded the error in that case as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 To describe an error or a deficiency in a bankruptcy notice as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act is to state a conclusion reached after a consideration of the legislative purpose and an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That question is not answered by observing that there has been a failure to meet a requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">In this respect, the majority in Lewis placed undue emphasis on the imperative terms of the Act and Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">If there were no failure to meet a requirement, there would be no defect or irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Furthermore, as noted earlier, the fact that the requirement is expressed by the use of the term "must" is not conclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">How otherwise might a requirement as to form be expressed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 
 The misdescription of the relevant section of the District Court Act was not capable of misleading the respondent as to what he had to do to comply with the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This is not a matter of dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The question is whether the misdescription involved a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">On the true construction of the Act, is it essential that there be no misdescription of the relevant section?</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Is it the purpose of the legislation that any slip, such as giving a reference to the statutory provision governing pre-judgment interest when what is intended is a reference to the provision governing post-judgment interest, should invalidate the notice?</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Is this so no matter how clear it might be from other parts of the notice that the claim is for post-judgment interest?</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">

27 The High Court then decided that the defect fell within the scope of s 306 of the Act (at [31]):
 
 Section 306, in its application to bankruptcy notices, makes it plain that some instances of non-compliance with the requirements as to the form of a notice will not invalidate the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The practical significance of an error or deficiency could vary according to the circumstances of each particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Errors or deficiencies in compliance with requirements as to form may involve questions of degree as well as of kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">At the same time, the decision in Kleinwort Benson shows that an error may be covered by s 306 even though it involves a substantial misstatement of an amount of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It was essential that the bankruptcy notice state the amount claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Was it essential that the amount be correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Section 41(5) made it clear that an overstatement, even a large overstatement, would not necessarily invalidate the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This court concluded that it was not the legislative purpose that a substantial understatement should necessarily invalidate the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">That is to say, accurately stating the amount of interest owing was not a matter of such importance that error necessarily resulted in invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In the present case, overstatement or understatement of the amount of post-judgment interest owing would not necessarily have invalidated the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">That is part of the context in which legislative purpose is to be considered in deciding whether the reference to s 83A rather than s 85 was fatal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">

28 The High Court found that the mistake in the bankruptcy notice was not a breach of an essential requirement of the Act and that s 306 applied to remedy the default (at [32]-[34]):
 
 In Lewis [at [95]] , Gyles J accurately identified the question as whether correct completion of the form prescribed by the regulations in every respect is a requirement made essential by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Bearing in mind that, in the present case, the error could not have misled the respondent as to what it was necessary to do in order to comply with the requirements of the notice, it is difficult to understand how, consistently with Kleinwort Benson , the respondent could succeed without an affirmative answer to that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In their dissenting reasons in Lewis , Lee J and Gyles J both gave a detailed account of the 1996 amendments to the Act and Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It is unnecessary to repeat what they said in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Lee J concluded [at [93]] : 
 
 
 
 Properly construed, the Act and Regulations do not express an intention to create a new regime of strict compliance imposed on a judgment creditor issuing a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The tenor of the Act and Regulations is not consistent with that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">An attempt has been made to recast the process of issue of a bankruptcy notice in terms more understandable to a judgment debtor, but the essential requirements of a bankruptcy notice remain as they have been stated by bankruptcy legislation over many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 
 Lee J also said [at [97]] : 
 
 
 
 It cannot be correct that amendments to the Act that left undisturbed s 41(5) and (6) which state that a notice that demands payment of a sum that is unjustified or excessive is only invalid if a debtor gives notice within a prescribed period, introduced a new regime in respect of bankruptcy notices under which a judgment debtor could have such a notice set aside where the amount claimed is due in fact and there is no prospect that the debtor could be misled as to the steps to be taken to comply with the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The amending Act could not have contemplated that a mistaken citation of the source of entitlement to claim interest would be a substantive defect or irregularity in the notice so as to exclude the operation of s 306 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">
 
 
 That view of the legislative purpose is persuasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The effect of the majority view in Lewis is to attribute to the legislature an overwhelming preference for form over substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">That should not be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Given that s 306 relieves against the invalidating consequences of some mistakes in the preparation of bankruptcy notices, the mistake that was made in this case falls within its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">

29 Before me, the appellant contended that the calculation of interest requirement is made essential by the Act because: 
 
 &#8226; the purpose of the requirement is to enable the debtor to verify that the amount claimed is in fact due;
 &#8226; the information required to be provided (namely an interest calculation) is of far greater importance than the requirement under consideration in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 (to give a precise identification of the provision under which interest is claimed);
 &#8226; in the usual case, the omission has the potential to "reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice" --- in the event of an overstatement, the debtor is entitled to pay the actual amount of the debt and not the overstated amount;
 &#8226; in the usual case the omission has the potential to prejudice the debtor's ability to exercise rights under s 41(5) --- in the event of an overstatement, a notice of overstatement must give sufficient information for the creditor to identify what is said to be alleged misstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">

30 Each of the above submissions is presented in the abstract and without consideration of the basis of the claim for interest in the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">I do not consider it helpful to compare and contrast different types of information that may be included in a notice, and attribute to them lessor or greater importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The task I have is to consider the legislative purpose of the Act and make "an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Assuming that the Notice does not comply (substantially or otherwise) with the requirement to give details of the calculation of the amount of interest, or fails to specify the actual interest rates over the relevant period, in my view it is not an essential requirement of the Act that such details be provided having regard to the following particular circumstances of this case:
 
 &#8226; there is and can be no dispute about the amount of interest claimed, 
 &#8226; an order of the Supreme Court of Victoria binding on the debtor has determined (and calculated) the amount of interest claimed, 
 &#8226; the Notice accurately sets out the basis of the claim for interest, namely pursuant to the Supreme Court Act , and has been determined (and calculated) by the Supreme Court of Victoria in the 2006 Orders, and 
 &#8226; there is (and can be) no suggestion that any interest is claimed in the Notice itself otherwise than as set out therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">

31 I cannot envisage that the legislative purpose of the Act would be served by concluding that the failure to adhere to the form in the way alleged by the appellant would lead to the Notice being a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It would be a classic situation of preferring form over substance to conclude that the Notice was a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The whole purpose of the essential requirements of the Act is to inform the debtor clearly and simply of the basis of the debt said to be owed, and this has been achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">32 In any event, in my view, the calculation of interest in itself is not necessarily an essential requirement of the Act, irrespective of the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">33 In Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33, Lee J considered the amendments to the Act, which were enacted in 1996, reviewed the legislation and considered whether the calculation of interest was a necessary requirement of a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">His Honour held at [70]-[73]: 
 
 Under s 41(2) as it now stands, the Act goes no further than restating that which was formerly provided in s 41(1) , namely that a bankruptcy notice be in accordance with the form prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Nothing turns on the fact that the old form was prescribed by rules and the new form prescribed by regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">On its face, therefore, the amendment has made the Act less prescriptive in operation than it was before the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 In the old notice, identification of the judgment relied upon was essential and was provided for in the form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">As a matter of practice, costs and interest could be included as part of the sum owing under the judgment provided they were sums for which the creditor could enforce payment by execution, but no further identification of the source of the obligation, other than the judgment, was necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">(See Kleinwort Benson at 77; Re Manion; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 23 ALR 270 at 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">) Identification of the authority to claim costs or interest flowed from identification of the judgment or order relied upon and provision of information in respect of costs and interest was not essential for the debtor to obtain an understanding the requirements of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It was suggested in CBC Sydney at 526 that inclusion of particulars of the calculation of interest in the bankruptcy notice was essential to the validity of the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">It is not clear on the authorities referred to in CBC Sydney that such particulars were ever an essential requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It would appear that there was no greater requirement than that the amount claimed for interest be calculated accurately and recited in the notice and not be claimed as an uncalculated amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">(See Re Davis; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1963) 19 ABC 100; Re McDonald; Ex parte Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd (1978) 18 ALR 505 at 507.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">) 
 
 The new notice does not require the judgment or order relied upon to be identified in the body of the notice but par 2 of the substantive part of the notice directed to the debtor states that a copy of the judgment or order relied upon by the creditor is attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It may be said, therefore, that the attachment referred to now performs the essential requirement of the old notice that there be identification of the judgment or order relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">It can be seen that if a notice does not recite in the body thereof, particulars of the judgment or order relied upon, it may be necessary to provide a copy of the relevant judgment or order for the debtor to understand the requirements of the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">(See Haros v National Australia Bank Ltd ( unreported, Federal Court, Ryan J , No 1391 of 1997, 24 November 1997).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">) However, where a creditor is instructed by a note endorsed on the new notice to attach other documents that relate to matters of costs and interest, it does not follow that such an endorsement expresses the intention of Parliament that provision of that material become an essential requirement of the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
 Furthermore, the only document required to be lodged with the Official Receiver pursuant to reg 4.01, other than the draft bankruptcy notice and additional copies thereof, is the sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The Regulations do not require the person applying for the issue of a bankruptcy notice to lodge with the Official Receiver a certificate of the taxed costs or a document showing how interest was calculated if the draft bankruptcy notice includes a claim for costs or interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">As noted earlier, the form of bankruptcy notice in force before the amending Act was enacted did not refer to external documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">As noted above, reg 4.01 does not require more than one sealed or certified copy of the relevant judgment or order be lodged with the Official Receiver and is silent on whether the Official Receiver retains that document or returns it to the party seeking the issue of a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Paragraph 2 of the new notice, which seems to place greater reliance on its substance than form, states that a "copy" of the judgment or order relied upon is "attached" and does not state that the "attached" document is a sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">(See St George Bank Ltd v Klintworth (1998) 86 FCR 240 at 242).</sentence>

(Emphasis added)
 
34 Justice Gyles agreed with the views of Lee J, and made additional comments at [113]:
 
 It is suggested that the 1996 amendments can be construed by reference to the new regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The regulations do not control the construction of the Act in any way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The 1996 amendments to the Act itself have nothing new (or relevant) to say concerning the required content of bankruptcy notices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">As I have said, the only material change to the Act was to make the position less, rather than more, prescriptive than previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The circumstance that the form now provides for much more information and is more complicated than hitherto would tend against a conclusion that the correctness and completeness of all information is a statutory requisite in the Kleinwort Benson sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The varying nature and importance of the contents of the form which appears from the analysis by Lee J supports this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Delegated legislation is, of course, binding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">That proposition is of no assistance in deciding whether strict compliance with a form prescribed by delegated legislation is made essential by the Act within the meaning of the majority judgment in Kleinwort Benson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Consideration of what was said by the majority at 76 of Kleinwort Benson shows that the phrase "made essential by the Act" in this context means what it says, and does not encompass the effect of a form prescribed by the executive government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">

35 The High Court of Australia in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 considered all judgments of the court in Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">After considering the minority decisions of Gyles and Lee JJ, the court approved their approach and applied the legislative purpose test applied by Gyles and Lee JJ (at [33] to [34]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I do not conclude, however, that the High Court necessarily approved the comments of Lee J concerning Re Bankruptcy Act 1966 ; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1979) 23 ALR 522.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Further, his comments in this regard were made concerning the old notice prescribed pursuant to s 41(2) of the Act as it was prior to the amendments made in 1996 where there was no requirement in the same terms as note 2 of the new form of the bankruptcy notice, although reflections were made by his Honour on the new notice which impacts upon his views as to what would be expected by the new notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">36 Nevertheless, the observations of Lee J concerning the requirement for a calculation of interest seem to be borne out by my review of the authorities to which he referred in his judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Even CBC Sydney 23 ALR 522 does not necessarily suggest that the inclusion of particulars of the calculation of interest was essential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In my view, the authorities referred to, including CBC Sydney 23 ALR 522, do not enable one to conclude that it was ever an essential requirement to include particulars of the calculation of interest in a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Undoubtedly the authorities indicate that the calculation must be made accurately, and that the period in which interest is claimed and the amount of interest must be specified in the notice, but they go no further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">37 In light then of the approach to the legislative purpose adopted by Lee and Gyles JJ, as approved by the High Court, in my view nothing in the Act indicates that now the calculation itself must be included in the Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In fact, if it were not a requirement prior to the 1996 amendment, the tendency would be towards the view that providing such information is not now a statutory requirement in the Kleinwort Benson [1988] HCA 34 ; 165 CLR 71 or Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 sense, if one adopts the approach of Gyles J as referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">38 In addition to the above authorities, two other cases need to be mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">39 In Re Spurr; Ex parte Werner (1991) 31 FCR 236, Heerey J considered the validity of a bankruptcy notice which stated the amount of interest due but not the rate of interest applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The notice also contained inconsistencies as to whether payment was to be made by the debtor in 14 or 21 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">His Honour dismissed the creditors' petition and held that the notice was invalid by reason of the inconsistencies in the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">As to the calculation of interest, his Honour held at 237:
 
 It seems to me that as long as the bankruptcy notice correctly states the amount of interest which is in fact due, the notice is valid and the debtor fails to pay that amount at his peril.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">No authority was cited which suggests there is any requirement to include in the notice all the information which would be necessary for the debtor to be able to recalculate the amount of interest to his own satisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">

40 The decision of Heerey J is consistent with the position observed by Lee J and the view I have arrived at after a review of the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The position adopted by his Honour is, in my view, currently the correct one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">41 In Bendigo Bank Ltd v Gard [1999] FCA 1179 ; (1999) 92 FCR 560, North J in an ex tempore decision considered an appeal from a decision of the registrar regarding the failure to make a sequestration order for non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice, by reason that the notice was defective in that it did not include an interest calculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">His Honour considered the decision of Kenny J in American Express International Inc v Held [1999] FCA 321 ; (1999) 87 FCR 583 where her Honour found that failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice was a breach of an essential requirement of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">At [11], North J held that even though there was no precise analogy between the purpose for which the copy judgment is required by the form, and the purpose for which the interest calculation is required, the interest calculation was nevertheless an essential requirement of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">His Honour found that the bankruptcy notice contained a substantive defect by reason of failing to contain an interest calculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">42 Justice North did not have the advantage of the reasoning in the subsequent cases referred to in this judgment, particularly Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396; Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33 and Snelgrove 157 FCR 313.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">With the benefit of the reasoning in these decisions, North J would have needed to have undertaken an analysis of the failure to comply with note 2 of the Schedule to the form in the context of the Act to determine whether it was an essential requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Merely equating such a failure to a failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice without the further analysis now required, would not be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In the circumstances, I do not regard the decision of North J as one I should follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">In any event, the circumstances of the case before me are quite different from those confronting his Honour, for he did not have a binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">43 In view of the above reasons I would conclude that even if the Notice did not substantially comply with the form, then in the circumstances of this case, such compliance was not an essential requirement of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">No other issue arises in this proceeding as to the operation of s 306(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">44 In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.</sentence>
