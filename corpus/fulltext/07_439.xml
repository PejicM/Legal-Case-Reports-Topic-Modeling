1 The respondents in this matter, Westpac Banking Corporation and two of its employees, have moved the Court to have judgment entered in their favour pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in respect of an application brought against them by Andrew Morton Garrett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In the alternative they seek orders that the proceeding be dismissed or stayed pursuant to O 20 of the Federal Court Rules or else that security be provided in respect of their legal costs in the amount of $80,000 and that the proceeding be stayed until that security be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The application purports to be bought by Mr Garrett in his capacities variously (i) as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust (No 3); (ii) as trustee for Corporate Investments pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated 31 December 2006; and (iii) as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Group and Corporate Investments Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It seeks orders that the respondents (i) have breached the duty of care owed to him by a bank to its customer; (ii) have breached the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 (Cth); and (iii) have breached the Banking Act 1959 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It went on to seek an order that Westpac credit to an account of Andrew Morton Garrett a sum of $11,350,000,000,000 and an order for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The application claims by way of interlocutory relief:

<sentence id="s10">"
 
 
 

3 I have annexed the accompanying Statement of Claim to these reasons: see Attachment A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 While the application in form seeks relief against all three respondents (hence the collective reference to Westpac), the Statement of Claim, though complaining of conduct of the second and third respondents, does not in any way plead causes of action against them individually which could give rise to the relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In consequence I will order that summary judgment be given in favour of the second and third respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 This leaves for consideration the claims against Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">FACTUAL SETTING 
 
6 The background to this matter is conveniently set out in Mr Garrett's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">During the course of October 2006 Mr Garrett approached a Robert Gray of (what he describes as) Creditnet to provide A$350 million by way of funding in respect of a sale of certain assets of Fosters Wines Estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I note in passing that there is nothing in the documentation before me which provides any details at all concerning Creditnet which is otherwise referred to in the material as "Creditnet Banking International&eacute;".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The respondents having done ASIC searches of the latter name have put on evidence to the effect that there is no registered company or business name which matches it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Its search though did disclose a company with the name "Creditnet International Pty Ltd" which is currently under external administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 Mr Garrett deposes that on or about 16 December 2006 Mr Gray rang him and confirmed verbally the availability of US$300 million in respect of the proposed bid for the Fosters' Estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 18 December Creditnet issued an International Sight Draft in the amount of US$350 million in favour of Cullen Capital at Mr Garrett's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That Draft is in evidence although the copy of it provided has the name of Cullen Capital crossed out: see Attachment B to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I note in passing that there is no evidence before me indicating the nature of the relationship, if any, between Mr Garrett and the named company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Mr Garrett goes on to indicate that Mr Gray, who appears to have a business address at Broadbeach on the Gold Coast, asked Mr Garrett to make a bid for all of the issued capital of Qantas Ltd on behalf of what Mr Garrett describes as Corporate Investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I have no evidence before me as to the nature of the entity (if it be an entity) so named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I would simply note in passing that at the end of a letter signed by Mr Gray it is described in the following terms: "Corporate Investments: A Sovereign Pure Trust, Private Investment Organisation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 On 21 December 2006 Mr Gray drew a further Sight Draft in the amount of US$11,000,000,000 in favour of Gaden Lawyers which was payable to its trust account, "for the benefit of an offer by Corporate Investments arranged by Mr Andrew Garrett of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Characteristic of the documentation in this matter, there is an attempt here to attribute a personality to the named "trust" which it simply does not possess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Gadens subsequently, according to Mr Garrett, endorsed that Draft in his favour and he executed what appears to be a declaration of trust in favour of Mr Gray in his capacity as Managing Trustee of Corporate Investments on 31 December.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">10 On 2 January 2007 Mr Garrett acting in his capacity as agent for Mr Gray made an offer to the board of Qantas to acquire the issued share capital of Qantas and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">To anticipate matters, after a series of exchanges with Qantas' legal advisers, Qantas not only rejected the offer (such had been foreshadowed at the outset), it also indicated it proposed no longer to acknowledge or to respond to his correspondence or telephone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Again to anticipate matters, Mr Garrett proceeded to make offers to acquire all of the issued capital of Fosters Group Ltd at a price of around $6.80 per share, this offer being made in his capacity as Managing Trustee of the Andrew Garrett Group --- Corporate Investments Joint Venture (this last being a discretionary trust established by deed on 4 January 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The settlor of that was Mr Gray as Managing Trustee of Corporate Investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The trust fund was the US$350 million Sight Draft issued on 18 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The beneficiaries were Mr Garrett in his capacity as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust (No 3) and Mr Gray in his aforementioned capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">There is nothing to suggest how this draft drawn in favour of Cullen Capital could be so dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Fosters indicated on 16 January 2007 that it attributed no credibility to the proposal and it did not propose to entertain the matter any further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 To complete the references to Mr Garrett's proposed take over activities, on 12 January, purporting to act in the same capacity as he did in relation to Fosters, Mr Garrett made an offer to acquire the issued capital of Suncorp Metway Ltd. On 14 January he made a like offer to acquire the issued share capital of BHP Billiton Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There is no evidence before me of the reception these offers received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">12 Insofar as the two Sight Drafts are concerned, Mr Garrett indicated he sought to deposit the A$11 billion in a Westpac account with the instruction that the local manager send this draft to Sydney to the attention of Mr White, the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The other Sight Draft was deposited in the same account on 4 January 2004 with a like instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">At this stage he sent letters to the Federal Treasurer seeking his assistance with regard to the respective transfer of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He has received no response from that source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">13 In email correspondence with Mr White, Mr Garrett expressed concern at possible delays in processing the Sight Drafts that had been deposited with the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Between 8 and 11 January he had conversations with Mr White and sent regular emails to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 11 January Mr Garrett received an email from Mr White which was in the following terms:
 
 "The documents you provided to us are not in standard format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In fact we are not accustomed to the format in which they have been prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">For that reason I have referred them to experts in our operations and international settlements areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">They advise the documents are unusual and not something they are accustomed to in the normal course of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">We have not been able to determine if the documents are negotiable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The path for presentation for payment is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Westpac has no operating procedures for Creditnet, which is also unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">We would expect to have proceedures (sic) in place if Creditnet was a reputable international clearer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I am conscious that you wish to act urgently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Pending further instructions to the contrary, I propose to return the originals to you for collection at Hutt Street Branch in Adelaide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">As Westpac is not involved in any transaction with you or any of the entities named in the documents I cannot see how I can be of further assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">"
 
 

Mr Garrett rejected Westpac's "approach" and refused to retrieve or accept the return of the Sight Drafts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">14 He went on to indicate in his affidavit that on 12 January he received an email from Mr Gray confirming that the signatory of the two Drafts, a Dr Zvonko Berdik-Albert, had received a call from the Office of Foreign Asset Control in the United States Treasury, advising that the Sight Drafts had been confirmed to Westpac and the funds were available to collection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">15 I should make several comments about the Sight Drafts which for the purposes of this proceeding have been treated by both parties as if they were bills of exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Westpac does not necessarily concede them to be bills, but given the nature of these proceedings has taken the approach I have mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Drafts themselves appear to be drawn in a fashion which invokes the UNCITRAL Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes (1988).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">16 When these Bills or at least that relating to the US$11 billion were deposited with Westpac, a stamped receipt of the type characteristically used when payments are being made into a bank account was provided to Mr Garrett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">17 I should also add that Westpac has put on evidence relating to the examination of the Sight Drafts by a Mr Pearson who was head of Risk Operations with Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Pearson's role with Westpac was to investigate transactions presented to it which fell outside its usual processing systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Instruments represented such a transaction as they had not been able to be processed by Westpac's ordinary cheque processing mechanisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Mr Pearson's initial reaction on being provided with the Instruments was that they were highly suspicious and unlikely to be genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In particular, Mr Pearson considered that the amounts recorded on the Instruments and the fact that they did not disclose any obvious paying bank on which to present the Instruments were cause for significant suspicion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Westpac has no standard procedures or agreements for the exchange of financial instruments with any financial institution with the name "Creditnet".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Pearson has never been involved in a transaction with an institution by the name of "Creditnet".</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Extensive searches and enquiries were unable to identify any major financial institution by the name Creditnet with the capacity to pay to Westpac the funds referred to in the instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In the course of his investigations into the Instruments, Mr Pearson conferred with the persons occupying the positions of Head of International Operations and the Head of International Trade for Westpac, both of whom were unable to propose any mechanism for Westpac to receive the funds referred to in the Instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In Mr Pearson's view, the Instruments were worthless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">THE CLAIMS MADE 
 
18 The essence of a claim made against the bank would appear to be captured in para 10 of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It is alleged that when Mr White received the Sight Drafts he should have arranged to credit Mr Garrett's account with the amount on the face of the drafts pending clearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">His failure to do so is alleged to constitute a "breach of the Duty of Care owed by a Bank to its Customer, Unconscionable, Breach of Contract, Breach of the Bills of Exchange Act (C'th) (1909), breach of the Banking Act (C'th) (1959 and Breaches of Banking and Financial Institution law (sic)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">These wrongs are not enlarged upon in any illuminating way in the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Garrett's 37 page written submission does little to redress this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">A large amount of wholly irrelevant material is contained in that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">THE RESPONDENT'S MOTION 
 
19 Mr Garrett is an undischarged bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">This provides part of the context for the respondents' motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">As Westpac contends, the notion that Mr Garrett is in a position to negotiate genuine banking instruments with a value in the order of US$11.35 billion is so fantastic as to amount, of itself, to an absurdity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Questions of Standing 
 
20 In relation to the draft for US$350 million Westpac contends, correctly in my view, that Mr Garrett has no demonstrated standing in respect of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It has been drawn in favour of Cullen Capital Pty Ltd (though this has been crossed out).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The relationship of Cullen Capital and Mr Garrett is not pleaded, nor is the basis of his entitlement to deal with the instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">While the deed of trust of 4 January 2007 purports to include this draft in the trust property of that trust, this does not make up for the deficiencies noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Absent the pleading of those matters, Mr Garrett has no standing to pursue any relief in respect of this draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">To that extent I would dismiss his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">21 In relation to the second Sight Draft, I accept for present purposes that Mr Garrett, in his capacity as trustee of that instrument, has standing to institute proceedings in respect of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The causes of action 
 
22 It is difficult to determine precisely what are the causes of action pleaded against Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The various species of wrong referred to in para 10a of the Statement of Claim and which have been noted above are, as I have said, unelaborated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Some indication of what he appears to have had in mind emerges from his written and oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He has contended that when Westpac took possession of the second draft on 3 January and provided Mr Garrett with the stamped credit slip, it thereby became the acceptor of the draft (as a bill of exchange) and incurred the liability of an acceptor under s 59 of the Bills of Exchange Act to pay the bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">This is the apparent explanation for the order sought in the application that Westpac credit his account in the sum of "$11,350,000,000,000" (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">23 The short and insuperable response made by Westpac to this is that, whatever the function Westpac might have been assuming to perform when receiving the alleged bill, it was not making itself an acceptor of it and that this is apparent on the face of the instrument itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Section 28(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act provides that a person is not liable as drawer, endorser or acceptor of a bill "if he has not signed it as such".</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Westpac simply did not sign the bill itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It did sign a receipt for the bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">That signing does not satisfy the requirement of s 28(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">If such be Mr Garrett's claim, it must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">24 The claimed breach of contract is unexplained and I do not speculate as to what was in contemplation, although the written submissions (which, in part, pr&eacute;cis text and statutes dealings with bills of exchange and banker customer) seem to tie it, as also the negligence claim, to a wrong committed by Westpac variously as an acceptor of the bill and as a collecting bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This pleading does not indicate the material facts giving rise to these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Nothing in the evidence put on by Mr Garrett would suggest that some viable cause of action is immanent in the circumstances upon which he relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">25 In my view, the Statement of Claim discloses no cause of action that has any reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">I do not consider that any useful purpose at all will be served by giving Mr Garrett an opportunity to replead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I am of this view because the application itself is misconceived in the principal relief it seeks in respect of the Sight Drafts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I need not comment on the interlocutory relief sought other than to say it is fanciful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">26 Accordingly I will give summary judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I order that the application be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">27 I should, for the sake of completeness, add the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">If I had not dismissed the proceedings, I would in any event have made an order for security for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Mr Garrett purports to rely upon his status as an undischarged bankrupt to shield himself from such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">This misdescribes his true circumstances in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He sues as a trustee having the rights of recourse against the trust estate that a trustee has.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Moreover, from his case, I am being asked to accept that beneficiaries apparently of some means stand to benefit from the proposed litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">They stand behind him and quite appropriately can be looked to, to guarantee costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">I would add that, on the evidence put on by Westpac, Mr Garrett's chances of success are remote and this also would weigh in favour of an order for security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>
