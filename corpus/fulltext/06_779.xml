 Introduction 
 
1 In July 1997 Walter Homewood, having suffered partial quadriplegia as the result of a swimming pool accident, was awarded compensation of $1,250,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">By 2004 the bulk of the sum which he received, comprising $995,000 after costs, had been dissipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">That dissipation was due in large part to his poor judgment, naivety and lack of the skills necessary to manage his finances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He made a claim for a disability support pension but that claim was refused on the basis that, under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the Act), the payment of the pension was precluded until 2022 by reason of the compensation which he had received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Mr Homewood appealed unsuccessfully to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the SSAT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">However in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) the decision of the SSAT was set aside and a decision made which had the effect that he would be eligible for disability support pension from 1 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the Secretary) challenges the Tribunal's decision in this Court on the ground that the Tribunal did not comply with its statutory obligation to give reasons for the basis upon which it reduced the preclusion period for the receipt of disability support pension to a period expiring on 1 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the Tribunal did comply with its statutory obligation to give reasons for its decision and the application will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Factual and procedural background 
 
5 Mr Homewood was born on 21 January 1961.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 3 February 1993 in Queensland, he suffered an injury to his neck as the result of a fall into an above-the-ground swimming pool.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The A-frame on which he was climbing to get access to the pool toppled over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">His injury resulted in partial quadriplegia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He was in hospital for nine months in Brisbane and was then transferred to the Shenton Park Campus of Royal Perth Hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">There he underwent inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation for five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">By 1998 he was able to walk with the aid of an elbow crutch and was able to drive a car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 In July 1997 Mr Homewood was awarded compensation of $1,250,000 by way of an agreed settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 17 July 1997 he was informed by a Centrelink officer that as a result of the payment he would be precluded from receiving any compensation affected Centrelink benefit for a period of 1,550 weeks from 3 February 1993 until 18 October 2022.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 On 8 August 2001 Mr Homewood sustained further neck injuries in a motor vehicle accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He was driving on a road near his farm at dusk when he swerved to avoid two kangaroos and drove into a tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Following the accident he was confined to a wheelchair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 On 10 September 2001 Mr Homewood lodged a claim with Centrelink for disability support pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">On 14 September 2001 Centrelink informed him that the claim for disability support pension had been rejected because of the application of the preclusion period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He requested a review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On 14 January 2002 a Centrelink authorised review officer affirmed the decision to reject the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 Mr Homewood lodged a further claim for disability support pension on 20 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He was advised on 22 June 2004, by the original decision-maker, that because the calculation of his preclusion period had been confirmed as correct and as no special circumstances could be identified in his case, it was not possible to exercise any discretion to reduce the preclusion period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He was told that the decision to reject his claim for disability support pension was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He requested a review of that decision but a Centrelink authorised review officer affirmed it on 19 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Homewood appealed, on 26 October 2004, to the SSAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">10 The SSAT approached the matter on the basis that the issue to be considered was whether Mr Homewood had special circumstances which would warrant reducing the preclusion period so that he would be paid disability support pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It heard his appeal on 3 December 2004 and on 17 December 2004 affirmed the decisions under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It identified those decisions as the decisions made by Centrelink officers, on 14 September 2001 and 23 June 2004 [sic], respectively affirmed by authorised review officers on 14 January 2002 and 19 October 2004, to reject his claims for disability support pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 On 8 February 2005 Mr Homewood lodged an application with the Tribunal for review of the decision of the SSAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">On 6 January 2006 the Tribunal made a decision in the following terms: 
 
 'The Tribunal decides that the decision under review be set aside and in substitution decides that so much of the compensation payment received by the applicant be treated as not having been made such that the preclusion period ends on 1 July 2006 instead of 18 October 2022.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">' 
 

12 The Secretary lodged an appeal, in the original jurisdiction of this Court, against the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That appeal was lodged on 2 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It rests solely on the ground of the inadequacy of the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Grounds of Appeal 
 
13 The grounds of appeal, as set out in the notice, are as follows: 
 
 
 '4.1 The Tribunal erred in law in that, by failing to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact, a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, and the reasons for: 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.1.1 its decision that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months (paragraph 55); 
 4.1.2 the basis on which the Tribunal reconciled that decision with the finding (paragraph 54) that Mr Homewood had available assets that would realise between $48,000 and $58,000 [sic] ; and 
 4.1.3 the Tribunal's decision that the appropriate part of the compensation payment received by Mr Homewood that should be treated as not having been made was the part that would lead to the preclusion period ending on 1 July 2006 instead of 18 October 2022 (paragraph 56) 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its decision, in contravention of the requirements of s 43(2) and (2B) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">' 
 
 

 The Tribunal's reasons for decision 
 
14 The Tribunal commenced its reasons by noting the agreement by the parties that the date of the accident, 3 February 1993, the amount of the compensation payment, $1,250,000, and the calculation of the preclusion period, 3 February 1993 to 18 October 2022, were not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It then said (at [4]): 
 
 'The issue in contention was whether special circumstances existed that would make it appropriate to treat the compensation payment either in whole or part as not having been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' 
 

15 The Tribunal reviewed Mr Homewood's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It dealt with that evidence largely by setting out his responses to various documentary exhibits put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The exhibits were not always identified with clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">16 First, the Tribunal referred to a statement of income and expenses which Mr Homewood had prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He explained particular outgoings including $500 per month for house repairs to make his house wheelchair accessible and high electricity and fuel costs were accounted for largely by the cost of driving to see his lawyer and to attend specialist appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">A bank account which had been shown as containing $3,695.20 contained about $3 at the time of his Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">17 Mr Homewood was referred to several Westpac statements covering periods from 16 September 2005 to 17 October 2005, 17 May 2005 to 17 June 2005, 22 July 2005 to 30 September 2005, 17 June 2005 to 15 July 2005 and 15 July 2005 to 17 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He gave explanations of a number of deposits and withdrawals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">One of the deposits was for a sum of $10 which his brother was paying him fortnightly to repay a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Another deposit of $79,806.56 made on 13 June 2005 represented the balance recovered after the sale of a property at Vance Street in Dudley Park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He had sold the property for $269,000 at a loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">A withdrawal on 20 June 2005 of $10,000 consisted of $5,000 given to his sister so she could pay rent for six months, and $5,000 to his parents so they could pay off a credit card on which they had made payments to assist him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">18 Mr Homewood told the Tribunal that because of injuries to his bladder he had to catheterise some six to eight times daily and purchase catheters in bulk at a cost of $157.50 for 150.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Since his accident he had suffered recurrent urinary tract infections and depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The depression had improved and he had become very mobile but the accident in 2001 had resulted in his condition deteriorating, which meant he was now in a wheelchair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Because of the second accident he had to sell a property of 24 acres that he had bought following his compensation payout.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">He said he was unable to qualify for emergency housing because he did not have any income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">As a result he was no longer on the emergency housing list of the Department of Housing and Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Mr Homewood believed his situation would change if he were paid the disability support pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">19 Mr Homewood said that out of the lump sum compensation of $1,250,000 for which he settled his claim in 1997, he actually received $995,000 after costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">He spent $55,000 of this on a Senator motor vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He paid $310,000 for the 24 acre property at Harts Road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He spent $13,000 on a Pajero car for his parents; $30,000 on a Jeep for the farm and $17,000 for a Land Cruiser for his brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Land Cruiser was registered in his brother's name and his brother subsequently left and disposed of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Homewood purchased two large demountable site huts for storage and office space for a total of $23,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He spent $30,000 on putting in a road to his property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He bought another utility vehicle for $15,000 and spent $10,000 on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">He sold it for $13,000, representing a loss of $12,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He sold the $30,000 Jeep for $17,000, representing a loss of $13,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">20 In July 1999 Mr Homewood purchased the lease of a video store for seven months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This cost $20,000 plus an additional $10,000 for stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">He thought he would be able to run the business with the assistance of his sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">However, it soon became apparent that the outgoings of the business were greater than cash coming in so he sold what remained of the lease at a loss of $2,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Some of the videos he sold for about $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In 2001 he sold the Harts Road property for $295,000, again representing a loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">21 Mr Homewood set up a $300,000 portfolio with Westpac in October 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It paid him an income of $1,500 per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">However he started debiting increasing amounts each month and by the end of 2000 had only $30,000 left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">This was completely expended by late 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">22 Mr Homewood told the Tribunal he had lent $45,000 to his sister which she has repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He lent $35,000 to a brother who agreed to repay it at $250 per fortnight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This he ceased to do after six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Mr Homewood said he believes his brother still owes him $28,000 although his brother says it is only $24,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">This is currently being repaid at $10 per fortnight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Another brother, Shane, owes Mr Homewood $500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">23 Mr Homewood currently owns a station wagon for which he paid $5,000 plus some extra for improvements which he thinks would be worth $3,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He has $3,000 worth of furniture, including a bed, computer, projector and stereo equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He has recently spent over $5,000 on a car for one of his brothers who is helping him out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">He told the Tribunal he had assets with Fremantle Auctioneers valued at approximately $12,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">He had DVDs worth $4,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Books, magazines, coins and medallions he had in storage would be worth about $4,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">24 The Tribunal referred to Mr Homewood's submissions and those of the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It set out the relevant statutory provisions and then considered his financial hardship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It began by observing that to qualify as 'special circumstances' financial hardship must be 'truly exceptional'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It accepted Mr Homewood's evidence that he had little left of value despite receiving a compensation payment totalling $1,250,000 in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">His remaining disposable assets were identified by the Tribunal as coin collections and other collectables worth approximately $12,000 and a further 20 boxes of items which would be worth about $4,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He also had DVDs worth some $4,000, a motor vehicle worth less than $5,000 and loans of $28,500 to two brothers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal found that the $28,000 was unlikely to be recovered and was currently being repaid at $10 per fortnight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">25 The Tribunal concluded that Mr Homewood's current financial circumstances had arisen primarily because of his inability to handle money, his lack of skills, his naivety and, at times, reckless purchasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">His investment of $300,000 in an investment portfolio with Westpac indicated that he understood the need for funds to be available in the long term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">But that money was drained very quickly to compensate for poor decision-making in other areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">His purchase of collectables appeared to have been extravagant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">This would not have been the case if he had retained the Harts Road property and if the $300,000 investment portfolio had remained intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The Tribunal did not conclude that he had been unreasonable in the expenditure of the lump sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Rather it found that his history of spending money, his lack of ability and poor management skills were consistent with a background which had not prepared him for dealing with large sums of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Tribunal then said (at [49]): 
 
 'Regardless of the reasons that have led to this situation Mr Homewood is facing the real prospect of having no income and little to sell to support himself in the near future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">' 
 

26 On the question of ill health, the Tribunal referred to Mr Homewood's submission that his circumstances had declined significantly following the 2001 accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">There was no medical evidence directly on the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">However the Tribunal accepted Mr Homewood's evidence to the SSAT that he is now confined to a wheelchair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">This was supported by correspondence from the South Metropolitan Health Service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Tribunal appeared to accept evidence that Mr Homewood's current medical condition requires him to purchase bladder catheters, costing $157.50 for 150 approximately every three to four weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It also accepted evidence that he is on a range of medication for conditions including diabetes and depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 Because of Mr Homewood's undisputed need to use a wheelchair, the Tribunal concluded that his current housing situation was not adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This was supported by correspondence from an officer of the South Metropolitan Health Service who had visited his residence and concluded that his housing was not appropriate for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">He had no income source in Western Australia and was not eligible for rental housing assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He had been placed on a waiting list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However even if an appropriate house were to become available, he would not qualify for it if at the time he had no income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">28 Following the SSAT decision of 17 December 2004 Mr Homewood had disposed of his one remaining significant asset, that being the house at Vance Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The Tribunal found the balance from that transaction of $79,806.56, which was deposited in his Westpac account on 13 June 2005, had been reduced to approximately $3,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Tribunal's reasons concluded as follows (at [54] --- [56]):
 
 '... Mr Homewood has approximately $40 --- 50,000 in loans owing to him and money that could be raised from the sale of his collection of coins and other collectables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He also has one motor vehicle worth less than $5,000 and personal effects and furniture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">He is unable to access appropriate housing even if it became available because he has no income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Little is to be gained now by pointing to the folly of how he has managed his compensation or the wisdom of such a large amount being paid as a lump sum and resulting in a preclusion period of nearly thirty years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 On behalf of the applicant it has been submitted that within six months he will be destitute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Tribunal accepts this as an accurate projection based on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Tribunal concludes that based on Mr Homewood's current financial situation, which can be described as straitened, as well as his health needs and in particular that he is wheelchair bound and unable to even go on a waiting list to access appropriate housing, "special circumstances" do exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">
 
 The Tribunal therefore sets aside the decision under review and in substitution decides that so much of the compensation payment received by the applicant be treated as not having been made such that the preclusion period ends on 1 July 2006 instead of 18 October 2022.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">' 
 

The reference in the Tribunal's reasons to Mr Homewood having approximately '$40-50,000 in loans owing to him' appears to be a factual error having regard to the preceding findings which indicate loans totalling $28,500 of which $28,000 was being repaid at $10 per fortnight and is likely to be irrecoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">If, however, one adds together all of the assets otherwise found by the Tribunal and includes the irrecoverable loan of $28,000, there is a total nominal value of $53,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Subtracting the sum of $28,000 leaves non-cash assets of $25,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Statutory Framework 
 
29 Section 17(1) of the Act defines the term a 'compensation affected payment' to include a disability support pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Section 1169(1) of the Act provides that a compensation affected payment is not payable during a lump sum preclusion period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">30 The method for calculating a lump sum preclusion period is set out in s 1170(4) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It involves dividing the compensation part of the lump sum payment by the income cut-out amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The 'compensation part of a lump sum compensation payment' is defined in s 17(3)(a) as 50 per cent when the payment is made in settlement of a claim in respect of an injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The income cut-out amount is the amount of income that would, through the application of the income test, produce a nil rate of pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">This appears from s 17(8) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">31 Section 1184K of the Act provides, inter alia: 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Part, the Secretary may treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as: 
 
 (a) not having been made; or 
 (b) not liable to be made; 
 
 if the Secretary thinks it is appropriate to do so in the special circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">' 
 

32 Section 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act) provides: 
 
 'A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 

33 Section 43 of the AAT Act provides, in the relevant parts: 
 
 '(2) Subject to this section and to sections 35 and 36D, the Tribunal shall give reasons either orally or in writing for its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 
 (2B) Where the Tribunal gives in writing the reasons for its decision, those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">' 
 

 Whether the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its decision in accordance with s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 
 
34 The decision before the Tribunal in this case arose under s 1184K of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It was necessary to the exercise of the power conferred by that section that the Tribunal identified 'special circumstances of the case' in which it thought it 'appropriate' to treat the whole or part of the relevant compensation payment as not having been made .</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In giving its reasons for a decision under that section to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not being made it would be expected, consistently with s 43 , that the Tribunal would: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Identify the circumstances of the case which it found to be 'special' and the reasons for which it arrived at that finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Explain why, in the special circumstances so found, it thought it appropriate to treat the whole or part of the compensation payment as not having been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Explain why it selected the particular quantum (ie the whole or part) of the compensation payment as not having been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">

35 The Secretary accepted that the question whether a particular set of circumstances is 'special' is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Absent misconstruction of the statute, the Tribunal's finding that circumstances are special for the purposes of s 1184K cannot enliven the Court's jurisdiction under s 44 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In this case the Tribunal treated Mr Homewood's reduced financial circumstances and his poor health as amounting, in combination, to 'special circumstances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That finding was not challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">So far as the reasons for decision went they properly set out the findings in support of that conclusion and the evidence on which it was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">36 Central to the Secretary's case was the proposition that the Tribunal failed to give its reasons for disregarding so much of the compensation payment as would bring the preclusion period to an end on 1 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">As counsel for the Secretary put it in his oral submissions: 
 
 'Our real concern is that the Tribunal hasn't explained in any way how it got to its figure or its result I should say of six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">And we say that, you know, although there is undoubtedly a wide discretion given by section 1184K particularly when it goes to the recognition of special circumstances, the implementation of that discretion, that is the selection of the part of the compensation payment that is to be disregarded ought to be driven by some principle and the principle ought to be in our submission derived from the object and the purposes and the surrounding provisions of this part of the legislation, particularly that part which prescribes the method by which the compensation preclusion period is calculated in the first place by dividing the money that is deemed to be available to support the applicant ... by the income cut-out amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">' 
 

37 It is important when considering the extent of the Tribunal's obligations under s 43 to have regard to the words of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The primary obligation imposed on the Tribunal by the section is to 'give reasons ... for its decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">They must include but are not limited to its findings on material questions of fact and reference to the evidence on which those findings are based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It must be possible '... to discern from the reasons given the actual reasoning process adopted ...' --- Comcare Australia v Mathieson (2004) 79 ALD 518 at [61] per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">38 The present case is not about a failure on the part of the Tribunal to include in its reasons the findings on material questions of fact which it has made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Nor is it a complaint that the Tribunal has failed to refer to the evidence on which those findings were based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Many of the reported cases involve claims of that kind of failure --- see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 331-332 (Gleeson J), 338 (Gaudron J), 346 (McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) cf 367 (Kirby J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">39 As Sheppard J said in Brackenreg v Comcare Australia (1995) 56 FCR 335 (at 349):
 
 'Although the obligations to state the findings of fact and the evidence upon which those findings were based are related to the obligation to give reasons, they are independent and separate obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">' 
 

That statement neatly identifies what might be called the tripartite nature of the obligation under s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It is an obligation: 

(i) to give reasons; 
(ii) to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact; 
 
 (iii) to include in its reasons reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings are based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">


 Brackenreg was a case in which the Tribunal was found not to have discharged its duty to refer to the evidence on which its findings of fact were made --- at 352.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In Dixon v Repatriation Commission (1999) 29 AAR 235, Wilcox J said of s 43 that it required (at [14])
 
 
 '... findings, on the substantial issues raised by the case, in terms sufficiently explicit to enable the parties to understand why the decision went the way it did...</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The question always is whether the decision maker has revealed his or her findings and conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">' 


See also Hawkins v Comcare [2001] FCA 726 ; (2001) 115 FCR 127 at 142 per von Doussa J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">40 The obligations set out in s 43 are not necessarily discharged by merely setting out findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence on which those findings are based and then stating a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">There will always be some legal rule or principle or discretion to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It may be that a rule or principle, like the major premise of a syllogism, will embody the factual circumstance necessary to give rise to a right or liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Then it may be sufficient to state that rule or principle in the reasons, the facts found as the minor premise, the evidence on which they are based and, the result which follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Not all, and perhaps not many results are so easily explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Whether the reasoning is syllogistic or otherwise, the Tribunal will have discharged its duty under s 43 if its reasons disclose its findings of fact, the evidence on which they were based and the logical process by which it moved from those findings to the result in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">41 Where a case involves the exercise of a discretion, the Tribunal's duty is not discharged by setting out the findings of fact necessary to enliven the relevant discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">That is so even in a case in which the enlivening facts are of an evaluative character, such as the existence of special circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">What must appear from the reasons is why the discretion was exercised in the way it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">42 The question in this case reduces to whether the Tribunal gave reasons for contracting the preclusion period to a period which expires on 1 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The Secretary's argument, as earlier summarised, involved the contention that, on a proper approach to the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal would have treated Mr Homewood's remaining assets as a compensation payment and calculated a fresh preclusion period based on that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">In the Secretary's submission this would have yielded a less generous contraction of the preclusion period than that which was selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The complaint that the Tribunal did not do that cannot, of course, constitute a complaint that it failed to comply with s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">So expressed, it would mean no more than that the Tribunal did not reason the way in which the Secretary thought it ought to have reasoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">43 The Secretary acknowledged that the Tribunal accepted, as an accurate projection, the submission that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">However the Secretary complained that the Tribunal did not explain why this was an accurate projection given its other findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">On the Tribunal's findings, as the Secretary's submissions summarised them, Mr Homewood's assets amounted to something in the order of $40,000-$50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">That finding, it was said, could not be reconciled with the selection of 1 July 2006 as the date for ending the preclusion period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Then it was said: 
 
 'It appears that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that Mr Homewood would need that amount to pay his living expenses over the next 6 months --- which cannot be reconciled with the fact that, once granted disability support pension, he will have income of $12,992.20 a year to pay his living expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">' 
 

44 In my opinion the discretion conferred by s 1184K of the Act is not confined by a principle of the kind enunciated on behalf of the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Importantly, the application of the discretion is not confined to cases in which all or part of a compensation payment has been dissipated or lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">There may be other cases giving rise to special circumstances in which it is appropriate to treat a payment in whole or in part as not having been made notwithstanding that it has not been lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">There may, for example, be circumstances in which a person in receipt of a compensation payment has also subsequently acquired obligations to support a close relative which places an ongoing drain on his or her assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">45 The Tribunal's obligation is to give its reasons for its decision in the sense explained earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">In so doing it is not required to express itself with the precision that might be required of a court of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">As Morling and Wilcox JJ said in Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313 (at 328): 
 
 'The tribunal is an administrative body and, whilst errors of law made by it are susceptible to correction by this court, its decisions should not be too closely scrutinised for the purpose of searching for errors of law in what may be imprecise language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">' 
 

In my opinion, the Tribunal made a finding of fact that within six months Mr Homewood would be destitute (absent the disability support pension).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It had regard to his asset position in coming to that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The complaint that it has not adequately disclosed its reasons for so concluding amounts to little more than a complaint about its findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">46 The Secretary accepted, by reference to [44] of the Tribunal's reasons, that the amount available for Mr Homewood's support could arguably be fixed at a lower range of between $20,000 and $30,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">That is not a reading of the Tribunal's reasons which is particularly generous to Mr Homewood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It is to be noted that the assets giving rise to those figures are comprised of 'coin collections and other collectibles', '20 boxes of items' 'DVDs ...; a motor vehicle worth less than $5,000'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">47 Having regard to the nature of the assets to which the Tribunal adverted in its reasons, its finding that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months was open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">That finding formed a base, in principle, for the exercise of the discretion under s 1184K(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The way in which it approached the exercise of that discretion was adequately explained by reference to its finding of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">While it may be argued that a more elaborate and principled approach by reference to the rules governing the fixing of preclusion periods under the Act would have been preferable, that is not the basis upon which the Tribunal's decision is attacked in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It is attacked only on the basis that it has failed to give adequate reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">In my opinion that challenge is not made out and the application should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Conclusion 
 
48 For the preceding reasons the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The applicant will be required to pay the respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">I certify that the preceding forty eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
