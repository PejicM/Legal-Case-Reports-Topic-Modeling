 NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY NSD 274 OF 2006 

 BETWEEN: WONG TAI SHING 
 APPLICANT AND: MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 
 FIRST RESPONDENT 

 THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
 SECOND RESPONDENT 

 JUDGE: CONTI J DATE: 5 MAY 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY 

 REASONS FOR REFERRAL OF PROCEEDINGS TO FULL FEDERAL COURT 

 
1 The applicant seeks review by way of statutory appeal, pursuant to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from the interlocutory decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('AAT') made on 24 January 2006, whereby it was determined that documents listed in the respondents' schedule of exempt documents were privileged from disclosure to the applicant, save as to those numbered 41 and 79.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That decision was made by Deputy President G D Walker, and his comprehensive reasons for decision extended over 56 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Both parties were represented by counsel on the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2 By the applicant's notice of appeal filed on 17 February 2006, there was raised the following asserted questions of law:
 
 (i) whether the answering of the several questions falling within the certificate issued by the Attorney-General dated 10 April 2005 under ss 36 and 36A of the AAT Act would be contrary to the public interest (ss 36A(2)(a) and 36D(2)(b) of the AAT Act);
 
 (ii) whether the AAT has failed to take into account relevant considerations;
 
 (iii) whether the proceedings before the AAT were in breach of the rules of procedural fairness; and
 
 (iv) whether the AAT has taken into account an irrelevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">

3 The applicant is a national of the People's Republic of China, having been born there on 26 November 1957.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">His wife and children presently reside in Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On 22 August 1999, he entered Australia pursuant to a visitor's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Shortly after his arrival, he applied for and was granted a subclass 560 student visa, valid until 5 January 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">His proposed course of study in Australia was to commence in the year 2000, and was to comprise a three year business management course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 15 December 2000, he applied for renewal of that visa for the purpose of continuing his course of study during 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Virtually from the outset he retained his present solicitor for the purpose of lodging and pursuing his visa renewal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">4 A decision on the applicant's visa application was made by the Minister adversely to the applicant on 22 January 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The applicant has claimed that the first time he became aware of that refusal was on the occasion of his arrest on 7 February 2002 by an officer of the Department of Immigration at his place of residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Since then he has been continuously held in detention, all applications made for his release having been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 The applicant's original visa refusal decision was made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs pursuant to s 501(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Subsequently on 13 February 2002 and on 4 March 2002, representations were made on his behalf by his solicitor to the Minister pursuant to s 503C of that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On 28 May 2002, the Minister decided not to revoke the earlier refusal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Documentary information from authorities of the People's Republic of China concerning the applicant were apparently placed before the Minister at the times of her relevant decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">None of those documents are said by the applicant to have been provided to him, whether by way of photostat copies or otherwise for some considerable time, until on 8 April 2002 there occurred the partial release of documents, purportedly pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Exemption from disclosure and production of the remainder has been the subject of litigious claim on the respondents' part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I observe that in the reasons for decision of the AAT, it is said (at [19]) that 'a large volume of documents' was released to the applicant on 29 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">6 During the hearing before the AAT on 6 December 2004, in the course of cross examination of a witness, being Mr Craig Riviere, counsel for the first respondent was granted an adjournment to enable representations to be made to the Attorney General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Upon further hearing on 19 April 2005, a document described by the applicant's solicitor as consisting of 'a number of pages' was admitted into evidence, whereof the first page alone was said to have been provided to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">That document comprised a certificate dated 10 April 2005 issued purportedly pursuant to ss 36 and 36A of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Privilege was claimed by officers of either or both of the respondents in relation to the remainder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The certificate, which is currently in contention, was to the effect that the disclosure of information specified in a confidential schedule to the certificate would be contrary to the public interest, in that it would prejudice the international relations of Australia within s 36(1)(a) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I was also referred in that regard to s 36A(1) and (2) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Upon the resumption of cross-examination of Mr Riviere, the Attorney-General objected to a number of questions which counsel for the applicant addressed to that officer, upon the footing that the abovementioned certificate excused the Attorney-General's witness from answering those and similar questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Attorney-General's objection was further upheld by the AAT, upon the basis of the certificate in relation to a large number of questions put in cross-examination to another witness called on behalf of the Attorney-General, being Mr Peter Coyne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 The current proceedings first came before me on 27 March 2006 and in response to the orders made on that occasion, the respondents submitted the following question for resolution by a Full Court on 13 April 2006:
 
 'Does the Court on an appeal under section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ("the Act ") in relation to whether under section 36A of the Act the answering of a question would not be contrary to the public interest: 
 
 
 
 (a) make a decision on the merits, by reaching its own opinion; 
 (b) determine the issue by reference to whether there was an error of law in the forming by the Attorney-General of his opinion; or 
 (c) determine the issue on some other basis?</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">' 
 


The respondents have further submitted that there arises for consideration, for construction in particular not only of ss 36A(2) and 44(1) of the AAT Act , but also of s 36D(2) of the same legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 

8 On 26 April 2006, the parties appeared again before the Court by their respective counsel, in the course of which debate occurred as to the desirability or otherwise of a Full Court addressing the issues arising as to privilege from production and consequential access, instead of a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It became readily apparent, in the course of oral submissions in particular, that sensitive issues may well be involved in relation to the controversy as to access to the documents or categories of documents sought by the applicant, being issues concerning at least Australia's international relationship with the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">For that reason it became further readily apparent that the outcome of any first instance proceedings in favour of either party would inevitably be challenged on appeal, having regard to the implications to both parties of production of what the respondents contend to be sensitive governmental documentation involving Australia's relationships with China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Moreover I was informed by counsel for the Minister that the s 36A notion of ' public interest' raises or involves 'a novel question without judicial precedent'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9 In the result, I adjourned the proceedings in order to determine whether the issues of statutory construction arising should be resolved in the first instance by a Full Court, if at all possible in the course of the next Full Court sittings in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In light of the debate that took place, I am of the opinion that such a course would be both appropriate and expedient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">If that course should be affirmed in principle, it would be necessary for the parties to submit to the court the precise text of the questions to be raised, and for any further procedural matters to be resolved by me, at least in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">10 In the circumstances, I grant liberty to either party to reapply on 3 clear days notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Associate:
