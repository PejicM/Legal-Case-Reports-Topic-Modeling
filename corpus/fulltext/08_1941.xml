<sentence id="s0">
 INTRODUCTION 
 Light emitting diodes ("LEDs") were, at the time of their invention, revolutionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">LEDs create virtually no heat and, as a result, use about one-tenth the power of incandescent light globes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">LEDs do not use a filament that can burn out or break and good quality LED lights can last for approximately 100,000 hours of continuous use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Unsurprisingly, the design, manufacture, importation and sale of LEDs in Australia is a competitive business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These proceedings concern two designs of rear combination LED lights (Registered Design No.302359 --- dual lens and No.302360 --- triple lens) ("the Designs") sold by the Applicant, LED Technologies Pty Ltd ("LED Tech"), under the name "LED autolamps" and registered under the Designs Act 2003 (Cth) ("the 2003 Designs Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The priority date for each Design is 22 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Each Design has the following statement of newness and distinctiveness: 
Seperate (sic) clip in lenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Base to take a variety of 2, 3 or 4 combination lenses for stop, tail, indicator, reverse LED lenses, no visible screws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Representations of each of the Designs are set out in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Designs are not dimensioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The LED Tech rear combination lights are manufactured in three sizes: 80mm, 100mm and 125mm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The first batch of dual lenses was produced by LED Tech's Chinese manufacturer (referred to throughout these proceedings for reasons of business confidentiality simply as "M") in September 2004 and sold in Australia in September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The triple combination lamps were first sold in Australia in April / June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">LED Tech's range of rear combination lamps includes 80BAR, 80BARR, 80BARW, 100BARR, 100BARW, 125BARR and 125BARW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The "A" stands for amber, the "R" for red and the "W" for white.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">LED Tech contends that the First to Fourth Respondents ("the Corporate Respondents") infringed the Designs and, further, by their conduct, contravened ss 52 , 53 and 65C of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA").</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">LED Tech contends that the Sixth and Seventh Respondents ("the Directors") authorised, directed and, further or alternatively, procured the conduct of the Third and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">LED Tech no longer seeks relief against the Fifth Respondent, Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">By cross-claim, the Respondents (except for the Second Respondent, Advanced Automotive Australia Pty Ltd) seek revocation of the Designs on three bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">First, pursuant to s 120(1) of the 2003 Designs Act , the cross-claimants contend the Designs are invalid as the representations are unclear and the monopoly lacks certainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Secondly, pursuant to s 93(3)(c) of the 2003 Designs Act , the cross-claimants contend that LED Tech is not solely entitled to registration of the Designs because another person also has a co-entitlement and finally, pursuant to s 120(1) of the 2003 Designs Act , the cross-claimants contend the Designs are not new and distinctive but are substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The cross-claimants also seek relief against LED Tech in relation to what they describe as unjustified threats of design infringement and other relief against LED Tech and Mr Ottobre (a director of LED Tech) in relation to allegedly misleading statements made by LED Tech on its website, in a circular sent to 5,000 prospective customers and on its packaging for its lights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">As these reasons for decision will demonstrate: These reasons for decision are structured as follows:

 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">2003 DESIGNS ACT 
 The relevant provisions of the 2003 Designs Act are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">What is disputed is the construction and application of those provisions to the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">"Design" in relation to a product is defined in s 5 of the 2003 Designs Act to mean "the overall appearance of the product resulting from one or more visual features of the product".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The phrase "visual feature", in relation to a product, is defined in s 7(1) of the 2003 Designs Act to include "the shape, configuration, pattern and ornamentation of the product".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Section 7(2) goes on to provide that "a visual feature may, but need not, serve a functional purpose" and that the following are not visual features of a product (s 7(3)): 
(a) the feel of the product; 
 
 
(b) the materials used in the product; 
 
 
(c) in the case of a product that has one or more indefinite dimensions: 
 
 
(i) the indefinite dimension; and 
 
 
(ii) if the product also has a pattern that repeats itself - more than one repeat of the pattern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Chapter 2, Part 4 of the 2003 Designs Act deals with the validity of registrable designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">"A design is a registrable design if the design is new and distinctive when compared with the prior art base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design": s 15(1) of the 2003 Designs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The "prior art base" for a design is defined in s 15(2) as consisting of: 
(a) designs publicly used in Australia; and 
 
 
(b) designs published in a document within or outside Australia; and 
 
 
(c) designs in relation to which each of the following criteria is satisfied: 
 
 
(i) the design is disclosed in a design application; 
 
 
(ii) the design has an earlier priority date than the designated design; 
 
 
(iii) the first time documents disclosing the design are made available for public inspection under section 60 is on or after the priority date of the designated design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A design is new "unless it is identical to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design": s 16(1) of the 2003 Designs Act (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A design is distinctive "unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design": s 16(2) (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The emphasised language is important because it demonstrates that newness and distinctiveness are to be assessed not by comparing the design in question to the prior art base as a whole but by comparing it individually to each relevant piece of prior art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Put another way, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being new or distinctive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In addition, subject to s 15(2)(c) of the 2003 Designs Act , the newness or distinctiveness of a design is not affected by the mere publication or public use of the design in Australia on or after the priority date of the design or by the registration of another design with the same or a later priority date: s 16(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Section 17 prescribes the things that are to be disregarded for the purpose of deciding whether a design is new and distinctive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There is, however, no claim in the present case that the Designs are identical to any prior art (ie not new); rather, the respondents claim that the Designs are substantially similar to the prior art (ie not distinctive).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Section 19 prescribes the factors to be considered in assessing substantial similarity in overall impression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It provides that: 
(1) If a person is required by this Act to decide whether a design is substantially similar in overall impression to another design, the person making the decision is to give more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">(2) The person must also: 
 
 
(a) have regard to the state of development of the prior art base for the design; and 
 
 
(b) if the design application in which the design was disclosed included a statement (a statement of newness and distinctiveness ) identifying particular visual features of the design as new and distinctive: 
 
 
(i) have particular regard to those features; and 
 
 
(ii) if those features relate to only part of the design - have particular regard to that part of the design, but in the context of the design as a whole; and 
 
 
(c) if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design, have regard to the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole; and 
 
 
(d) have regard to the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">(3) If the design application in which the design was disclosed did not include a statement of newness and distinctiveness in respect of particular visual features of the design, the person must have regard to the appearance of the design as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">(4) In applying subsections (1), (2) and (3), the person must apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates (the standard of the informed user ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">(5) In this section, a reference to a person includes a reference to a court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It will be necessary to return to consider these and other provisions of the 2003 Designs Act in greater detail later in these reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It is sufficient at this point to note that the express provisions of the Act are a complete answer to the Corporate Respondents' submission that because some of them had "registered designs of their own which reflect the commercial products that they sell" it provides a "further indicator that there is sufficient distinction between the [Corporate Respondents'] products and the [Designs] to avoid infringement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In fact, it is another entity based in Mauritius and associated with the Sixth Respondent, Anthony James Keller ("Keller"), Prime Global Brands Ltd, which on 9 October 2006 lodged applications for registration of designs for a single, double and triple tail light assembly which were subsequently accepted ("the Condor Designs").</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Representations of each Condor Design are set out in Annexure B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">But whatever the relationship of Prime Global Brands Ltd to the Corporate Respondents, two things are clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">First, the Condor Designs are irrelevant to the newness and distinctiveness of the Designs (ie the validity question) because they were published subsequently: s 16(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Secondly, the fact that the Condor Designs were accepted for registration says nothing with respect to their own newness and distinctiveness (ie the infringement question); s 39 requires the Registrar to register any design (subject to certain exceptions: s 43) that satisfies certain formalities; there is no inquiry into whether the design is registrable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It is only during the examination process that the Registrar considers whether the design is registrable: s 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">(Indeed, in this case an examiner raised the concern that the Condor Designs were not new and distinctive in light of LED Tech's prior Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">) Even then, a Registrar's decision upon examination is not entitled to judicial deference: see s 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In short, the fact that the Corporate Respondents may maintain registered (and even examined) designs in respect of their own products is irrelevant to the judicial determination of whether those products infringe the earlier-registered Designs and whether those Designs are registrable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">B. AUTHORSHIP AND REVOCATION 
 It is convenient to start with the cross-claimants' contention that the Designs should be revoked pursuant to s 93(3) of the 2003 Designs Act because "M", not Mr Ottobre, is in fact the sole or joint author entitled to registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">For their part, the cross-respondents have two responses: (1) Mr Ottobre is the sole author of the Designs and his employer LED Tech is the only person entitled to registration; and in the alternative (2) even if "M" (jointly) created the Designs, it did so pursuant to a contract with LED Tech and therefore would not be a person entitled to registration under s 13 of the 2003 Designs Act in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">With respect to the first point, the cross-claimants dispute the proper legal characterization of the facts relevant to creation; with respect to the second, they submit that as a matter of law an independent contractor such as "M" must be distinguished from an employee (whose design created in the course of employment they concede would belong to the employer).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Who then, in fact, is entitled to be entered as the registered owner of the Designs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Section 13(1) of the 2003 Designs Act lists the persons "entitled to be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design that has not yet been registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" The list is: 
(a) the person who created the design (the designer); 
 
 
(b) if the designer created the design in the course of employment, or under a contract, with another person - the other person, unless the designer and the other person have agreed to the contrary; 
 
 
(c) a person who derives title to the design from a person mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b), or by devolution by will or by operation of law; 
 
 
(d) a person who would, on registration of the design, be entitled to have the exclusive rights in the design assigned to the person; 
 
 
(e) the legal personal representative of a deceased person mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Unsurprisingly, more than one person may be entered on the Register as the registered owner of a design: s 13(3)(a) of the 2003 Designs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">However, each of the persons registered must fall within one or more of the categories of persons listed in s 13(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">If not all of the entitled persons are included in the registration, the court may revoke the registration: s 93(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The registered owner of the Designs is LED Tech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The cross-claimants contend that the Designs should be revoked because when each of the Designs was first registered, LED Tech's Chinese manufacturer, "M," was entitled to be registered in addition to or in lieu of LED Tech and was not so registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The cross-claimants' contention should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">To understand the flaws in that contention, it is necessary to restate some of the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In 1987, Mr Ottobre established a business selling automotive parts under the name "Auto Trade Supplies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In 2002, Mr Ottobre incorporated a company "ATS Auto Trade Supplies Pty Ltd" in relation to that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In April 2002, Mr Ottobre attended the Automotive Parts Association Trade Show in Taiwan and became aware of the use of LEDs in automotive lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">At the same trade show, Mr Ottobre met a representative from a Taiwanese company, Valens Company Limited ("Valens"), discussed with that representative the lights that Valens manufactured and ascertained that Valens would be interesting in manufacturing lights for Mr Ottobre's company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">After the trade show, Mr Ottobre developed an 80mm x 80mm square lamp comprised of an injection-moulded lens fitted with LEDs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The circuit board containing the LEDs was fitted inside the lens, then held in place and sealed by pouring resin over the top of the circuit board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The lamps were then clipped into a simple base attached to the vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The resulting lamp was both waterproof and dustproof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">After corresponding by email with the Valens representative, Mr Ottobre visited Valens in Taiwan in mid-July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Before going to Taiwan, Mr Ottobre prepared sketches of his design for a single square LED lamp, 80mm x 80mm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">At the meeting in Taiwan, Mr Ottobre provided the Valens representatives with the sketches and a sample of a conventional 80mm x 160mm lamp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Between July and December 2003, Mr Ottobre requested Valens to manufacture the single lens in three sizes --- 80mm x 80mm, 100mm x 100mm and 125mm x 125mm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There were difficulties and relations ultimately soured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Valens manufactured single LED lamps and the bases for such lamps which were sold in Australia from about February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Valens continued to supply the lamps without the base until about February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In approximately April 2004, either during or after attending another Automotive Parts Association Trade Show in Taiwan, Mr Ottobre met in a hotel board room with "M"'s owner and some of its representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Ottobre provided them with samples of a single-lens 80mm x 80mm LED automotive lamp (being the lens manufactured by Valens) and some hand-drawn sketches he had prepared of a lamp base into which individual red, amber and white lamps could be fitted as double and triple combination lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Ottobre did not retain copies of the sketches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In addition to the samples and the sketches, Mr Ottobre explained the combination lights and his estimate of the likely sales of such lights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Mr Chao, a representative from "M," gave evidence that he received the samples and the sketches together with an explanation from Mr Ottobre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Mr Chao's evidence was that Mr Ottobre provided three hand-drawn sketches of the base, being a sketch of the dual base from the top view, a sketch of the dual base from the rear view and a sketch of the cross-section of the side view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The drawings did not show dimensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Although Mr Ottobre's evidence was that his sketches were only of two views, Mr Chao gave evidence that the hand-drawn sketches were of the views set out in the engineering drawings marked "1", "2" and "3" on Annexure C. I accept Mr Chao's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Following the meeting, Mr Chao worked with M's engineers to convert Mr Ottobre's hand-drawn sketches into CAD (Computer Aided Design) format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">"M"'s engineers used CAD technology to prepare detailed engineering drawings of a 3D model and 2D drawings of the combination lamp base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">At a practical level, the use of CAD enables an operator of the computer software to lay out and develop work on a screen, print it out and save it for future editing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Having converted Mr Ottobre's hand drawn sketches of the base into CAD format, Mr Chao printed the engineering drawings of the lamp base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">A copy of the engineering drawing, in the form of Annexure C, was sent by Mr Chao to Mr Ottobre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">On 4 June 2004, Mr Ottobre emailed Mr Chao asking "M" to provide him with a price for making a mould to house, in both dual and triple combination, the LED 80mm lamps with the same pattern lenses as the sample Mr Ottobre had provided to "M" back in April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">On 11 June 2004, M sent by facsimile an invoice to LED Tech quoting US$7,500 to create a "mold for base holder for two LED80 one mold with one cavity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Mr Ottobre accepted "M"'s quoted price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">"M"'s engineers used the CAD engineering drawings to prepare a mould for the two combination lamp base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The CAD engineering drawings were created using the same software that controls the machines which cut moulds from a diecast metal blank from which the products were produced, thus greatly simplifying the process of manufacturing an actual product from the design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">M's engineers also produced a three-dimensional model of the combination lights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">On 18 June 2004, after receiving a copy of the model, Mr Ottobre printed drawings from the three-dimensional model and used those drawings as the basis for LED Tech's application to register the dual and triple combination lamp designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Chao gave evidence that "M"'s quoted price (and ultimate bill, which was paid by LED Tech) for production of the mould included, without any separate allocation, the cost of creating the CAD drawings, which, as noted earlier, are used to control the die-cutting machines to cut the moulds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Authorship of a design is in the "person whose mind conceives the relevant shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation applicable to the article in question and reduces it to visible form": Chris Ford Enterprises Pty Ltd v BH &amp; JR Badenhop Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 75 , 80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">On the facts just described, it is clear that Mr Ottobre is the person who conceived the relevant shape, configuration and pattern of the Designs and reduced it to a visible form; "M" simply converted that design to an electronic form in order to facilitate the production process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Put another way, it was Mr Ottobre, not "M", who had the idea for dual and triple combination LED lamps in one base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It was Mr Ottobre who reduced that idea to visible form in the sketches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">As the engineering drawings marked "1", "2" and "3" on Annexure C record, it was Mr Ottobre's sketches which contained the features different from those in any other previous design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Accordingly, Mr Ottobre was "the person who created the design" and his company as his employer was the sole person entitled to be registered as its owner: s 13(1)(b) of the 2003 Designs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Assuming, contrary to what I have just found, that the facts set out above would support the conclusion that it was an employee or employees of "M", instead of (or in addition to) Mr Ottobre, who was the author of the Designs, then my conclusion on the entitlement question would not change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I accept (and it was not contested) that "M" was an independent contractor rather than an employee of LED Tech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">That being so, "M" and its employees did the work "under a contract with another person" (LED Tech) within the meaning of s 13(1)(b) of the 2003 Designs Act and LED Tech is the person entitled to register the design thus created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">There was some dispute as to whether there was in fact any contract between LED Tech and "M" for the creation of the CAD drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The proposition was founded on the basis that there was no separate charge or entry on any billing invoice relating specifically to the provision of that particular service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It may greatly be doubted that the absence of an itemised amount charged for the service goes any distance towards showing that the work was not done under a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Be this as it may, in the end, I accept the evidence of Mr Chao that the price on the invoice for the moulds included in it the cost of the creation of the CAD drawings, which were necessary and incidental to the manufacture of the moulds themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In other words, I am satisfied that the Designs, to the extent that they were created by "M" at all, were so created pursuant to a contract with LED Tech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The only remaining question, then, is whether that contractual relationship in the absence of an employment relationship is sufficient to make LED Tech the owner of the Designs under s 13(1)(b) of the 2003 Designs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In my view, it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">As noted above, the plain language of s 13(1)(b) states that if "the designer created the design in the course of employment, or under a contract , with another person - the other person" is the person entitled to be registered as the design's owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">As the disjunctive word "or," coupled with the commas on either side of the phrase "under a contract" indicate, there are two separate and distinct circumstances in which the creator of a design is not entitled to register it: (1) where the designer creates the design in the course of employment, whether or not there is a specific contract; and (2) where the designer creates the design under a specific contract, whether or not there is an employment relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">This case would fall in the latter category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The cross-claimants submitted that s 13(1)(b) should be found to have the same meaning as s 19(2) of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) ("the 1906 Designs Act"), which provided that "[w]here, in accordance with an agreement for valuable consideration entered into by a person with another person, the other person or an employee of the other person acting in the course of his employment makes a design for the first-mentioned person, the first-mentioned person is the owner of the design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" I agree that the language of the old provision is substantively not different from the new.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It is to be noted, however, that under this provision of the 1906 Designs Act, employees are distinguished from "other persons" acting in accordance with a contract (ie independent contractors) by use of the disjunctive "or" to establish two separate and independent circumstances in which the ownership of a design does not vest in its creator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">That is, the text of the former Act bears a construction that I would independently ascribe to the current provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Moreover, the cross-claimants cited no case or authority (and my own researches have discovered none) to contradict or otherwise dissuade me from this plain reading of the old and new acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Accordingly, the submission that an independent contractor such as "M" retains any entitlement to register a design created pursuant to a contract must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">For those reasons, the cross-claimants' contention that the registration of the Designs should be revoked pursuant to s 93(3)(c) of the 2003 Designs Act on the basis that LED Tech is not solely entitled to registration of the Designs because another person also has a co-entitlement is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">C. ALLEGED INVALIDITY OF THE DESIGNS AS REPRESENTATIONS UNCLEAR AND LACK CERTAINTY 
 The cross-claimants' further contention was that the registration of the Designs should be revoked pursuant to s 120(1) of the 2003 Designs Act because the visual features of the registered designs are unclear and are thus invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The invalidity is said to arise because the representations fail to adequately delimit the scope of the monopoly afforded by registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Before turning to the facts relevant to this issue, it is necessary to look again at the system of registration prescribed by the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">A registered design is a design that is registered in conformity with the 2003 Designs Act: s 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The 2003 Designs Act requires that there be a Register kept at the Designs Office: s 111(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Register may be kept by computer: s 112.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Particulars of a registered design must be entered in the Register: s 111(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Those particulars include representations of the design: s 111(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">A "representation" means "a drawing, tracing or specimen of a product embodying a design or a photograph of such a drawing, tracing or specimen": s 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The public is entitled to access all documents filed in connection with the registration of the particulars of a design: ss 111(3) and 113(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">If the Register is kept by use of a computer, inspection of the Register is satisfied by giving the public access to a computer terminal that they can use to inspect particulars kept by use of a computer: s 113(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Register is prima facie evidence of any particulars entered in it: s 118.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Moreover, if the Register is wholly or partly kept by use of a computer, a document issued by the Registrar producing in writing all or any of the particulars comprising the Register or that part of it, is admissible as prima facie evidence of those particulars: s 118(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Finally, a signed copy of or signed extract from the Register is admissible in any proceedings as if it were the original: s 118(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It will be necessary to return to consider these provisions in further detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The facts relevant to this issue are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The legal characterisation of them is disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">IP Australia operates a website at www.ipaustralia.gov.au.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Access to that part of the Register kept by use of a computer is through this website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A copy of one form of the representations of each Design extracted from the IP Australia website is set out in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">These representations were also attached to Certificates of Registration produced by the Designs Office and tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The drawings in Annexure A are pink and faint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">It will be necessary to return to consider the form of these drawings later in these reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">To use the IP Australia website to search for representations of a registered design, it is first necessary to go to a webpage headed "AU Designs Data Searching --- Introduction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">That page informs users that not all representations are available online and that copies of representations can be obtained from the Designs Office in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The foot of the page contains a statement that "[c]ontinuing further indicates your acceptance of the terms and conditions defined in 'Legal and Copyright' button above".</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">That "Legal and Copyright" notice states, inter alia, that the databases accessible through the IP Australia website contain errors and inaccuracies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">LED Tech's solicitor gave evidence in this matter that, in addition to inspecting that part of the Register maintained by computer, he inspected the physical files maintained by IP Australia in respect of each of the Designs which had been sent from Canberra to Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Each physical file included a set of six greyscale drawings with perforations on the left hand margin indicating that they were received by IP Australia on 22 June 2004, being the filing date of the application for registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Each set was kept on the relevant file in an envelope endorsed with the word "Informals".</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The greyscale drawings are not faint like the pink drawings displayed on the IP Australia website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">A review of the file maintained by IP Australia revealed that the application for registration of each design in June 2004 was accompanied by one set of the greyscale drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Regulation 4.04(1)(f) of the Designs Regulations 2004 (Cth) states that for s 39(2)(a) of the 2003 Designs Act, part of the formalities check is confirmation by the Registrar that the application includes 5 copies of each representation of each design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Of course, LED Tech's application did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In November 2004, Mr Ottobre received notice from IP Australia that his application for registration did not satisfy the formal requirements for registration because he had provided the office with only 1 set of representations, namely the greyscale drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The notice stated that if the problem was not fixed within 2 months, the applications might lapse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The pink drawings were subsequently lodged by Mr Ottobre in response to that request from IP Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Two questions arise for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">First, what is the registered design (ie what are the legally cognisable representations of the design), and secondly, is that registered design "reasonably clear and succinct"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In LJ Fisher &amp; Company Ltd v Fabtile Industries Pty Ltd (1978) 1A IPR 565 , 571-72, Fullagar J said: 
I am clearly of opinion that a registered design in order to be valid, must be reasonably "clear and succinct"; that is to say the design sought to be monopolised by copyright must appear with reasonable clarity, and without necessity for unreasonably prolonged or complicated series of deductions, from the registered representation of an article to which the design has been applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In argument in Phillips v Harbro Rubber Co (1920) 37 RPC 233 , Sir Duncan Kerly KC said: 
 
 
A design may be valid for any form that is new, subject to this, that it must be distinct and present an appearance that strikes the eye as being different from any previously existing shape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">[Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">]
 
 
...</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">But in design law I think that the design is addressed to a person of some skill who might be called a person skilled in the art, but that a person skilled in the art is not necessarily familiar with particular methods of manufacture per se; I think he knows the prior art articles and the prior art registered designs and knows as much about manufacture as he would reasonably be expected to deduce from a study of those designs and articles, but not necessarily any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">I do think that if a design, depicted by reference to an article to which it has been applied, appears difficult to construe, evidence is admissible from persons familiar with those articles and with methods of applying designs to them, at all events where the design is as here confined to configuration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In what follows I use the expression "person skilled in the art" as a shorthand for a person with the elementary knowledge that I have above indicated; that is to say a person in the circumstances of this case, who is familiar at least with the shape and appearance and (so far as obvious) constituents of prior art roof tiles composed wholly or chiefly of metal, as known at the priority date of the registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">(Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">)
 
 Much of the cross-claimants' arguments proceeded from the premise that no sufficient representation of each Design appeared on IP Australia's website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The cross-claimants submitted that the visual features of the Designs were hard to discern when looking at the pink drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Garrard, a consultant to the automotive electrical industry, was called to give evidence by the cross-claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He looked at the pink drawings on the IP Australia website and in the Certificates of Registration produced by the Designs Office tendered in evidence and initially said he had difficulty in understanding the features of the Designs such as the side profile of the base and the degree of rounding of the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In cross-examination, he modified that evidence to the extent of acknowledging that he was able to discern features of the Designs except for the curved ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Other witnesses gave evidence about the pink drawings and what they could and could not discern from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">It is therefore necessary to examine the validity of the cross-claimants' premise that no sufficient representation of each Design appeared on IP Australia's website with some care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">As I noted earlier, printed representations of some of what was displayed when IP Australia's database was searched were tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Five different views of each Design were tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Even if one of those views were to be thought insufficient to convey to the observer all of the relevant features of the Design it by no means follows that the combination of images is necessarily deficient in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In my view, it is possible to discern from the printed representations the visual features of the Designs, including the two particular matters to which Mr Garrard drew special attention, the side profile of the base and the degree of rounding of the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Adopting the language of Fullagar J, I consider each Design to be reasonably "clear and succinct" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It may be said that the pink drawings are not perfect or that they could be better or clearer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">However, each Design does appear with reasonable clarity, and without necessity for unreasonably prolonged or complicated series of deductions, from the registered representation of an article to which the design has been applied .</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It is necessary to record, however, that the documents that were tendered show a particular magnification and resolution of the representations appearing in the database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Because the data is held electronically and displayed on the IP Australia website (in Adobe Reader as PDF documents), it is possible, within limits, to reproduce the representations at greater magnification than may first be displayed on the screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">That is, the printed exhibits cannot be taken as necessarily indicating the largest magnification or best resolution of what appears in the database and is accessible by the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Again, it is possible to observe on IP Australia's website the five different views of each Design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">When those views are displayed at higher magnifications, the details and specifications of each Design appear not just with reasonable clarity, but with great clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">However, when I asked the parties after the hearing whether it would permissible for the Court to have regard to the magnified displays on the website (which were not tendered into evidence by way of printed or electronic copy), the Respondents contended that there was no evidence that the representations on the IP Australia website could be or were in fact magnified by any witness or that a member of the public seeking information as to a registered design would be expected to electronically magnify the online representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">I reject both contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">First, there was evidence that witnesses had accessed the Designs on the IP Australia website and magnified the representations to some extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Secondly, the 2003 Designs Act itself makes assumptions and imposes expectations about the public's access to and use of computers to view the registered designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">As noted earlier, the Act provides that the Register may be kept by computer and that the public must be given access in the Designs Office to a computer terminal in order to inspect the particulars of designs: ss 112 and 113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Notably, the Act does not stipulate that the Designs Office must explain to a member of the public how to use the computer to view the designs; rather, the provision of access is said to be sufficient, which necessarily carries with it a presumption or expectation that the public will know enough about computers to be able to make use of that access without further prompting (or that if they do not know enough, the problem will be theirs rather than that of the Designs Office or the registered proprietor of the design).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In that context (ie the context of a design registration system which is publicly accessible through a website and provides a tool to enable users of the system to magnify representations to a size larger than that physically filed), it would be absurd to draw a distinction between a presumption or expectation that a member of the public would be able to access the base-level display of a design on the computer (an expectation which the parties implicitly accepted in their submissions) and a presumption or expectation that that person would not be able to go one further step and click on the magnifying lens at the top of the screen in Adobe Reader without prompting (which was effectively what was put by the Respondents).</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Because no special skill or complicated process is required to magnify an image (the magnifying lens icon, which is used with the same signification in many internet and desktop computing applications, is displayed prominently at the top of screen as soon as the base-level magnification of the design is opened), once one presumes that a person will be able to access the image at all (again, a presumption implicit in the Act and accepted by the parties) then it must also be presumed or expected that the person could magnify that image without prompting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Although I do not consider it necessary in this case to rely on it in light of ss 112 and 113 of the 2003 Designs Act and my primary conclusion that the printed representations of the Designs tendered in evidence were reasonably clear, I should also note that the doctrine of judicial notice stated in s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides an additional or alternative basis for reaching the same conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Section 144 provides that proof is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and that is common knowledge generally, and that a judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way he or she sees fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">I consider that it is not reasonably open to question that PDF images may be magnified in Adobe Reader and that this fact has been and is general common knowledge to any user of computers and the internet during the relevant period of 2004 to the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Accordingly, I would be inclined to the view that proof was not required that a member of the public seeking information as to a registered design would be expected to be able to electronically magnify the online representations, such that the Court is not barred from viewing the Designs online at higher magnifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">These additional considerations provide separate support to reject the contention that the visual features of the Designs are unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The representations do not fail to adequately delimit the scope of the monopoly afforded by registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In the circumstances, I need not express a concluded view as to whether the Register in the case of these Designs is identified as being the representations printed from the IP Australia website and tendered in evidence, as what is held electronically and accessible by the public on the IP Australia website, as incorporating some or all of the hard copy documents held on the file maintained by IP Australia, or as some combination thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The reason is that, in my view, each Design that is registered is reasonably clear regardless of which of the foregoing definitions of the Register is used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is therefore not necessary to resolve the question of what exactly is the Register for the purposes of the 2003 Designs Act or to resolve the question which would otherwise arise of what obligation a person who searches the Register electronically has if that search suggests that what is available electronically is incomplete or equivocal in a way which might be resolved by examination of hard copy documents kept on the relevant file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">D. NEW AND DISTINCTIVE 
 The cross-claimants next submitted that, pursuant to s 120(1) of the 2003 Designs Act, each Design is invalid and should be revoked because each is substantially similar in overall impression to the prior art base and, in particular, LED Tech's own single-lens LED lamp which forms part of that prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">That contention should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The relevant provisions of the 2003 Designs Act are referred to above: see [9] to [13].</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">That a design is required to be "new and distinctive" to be protected under the 2003 Designs Act is a threshold requirement introduced in the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The 1906 Designs Act used very different language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It required a design to be "new or original" and provided (s 17(1)) that a design was not to be registered in respect of an article if the design: 
(a) differs only in immaterial details or in features commonly used in the relevant trade from a design that, before the priority date in respect of the application for registration, was registered, published or used in Australia in respect of the same article; or
 
 
(b) is an obvious adaptation of a design that, before the priority date in respect of the application for registration, was registered, published or used in Australia in respect of any other article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">As a result of difficulties in interpretation and application, the Australian Law Reform Commission ("ALRC") recommended that the "innovation threshold" in s 17(1) of the 1906 Designs Act be replaced by the two-step "new and distinctive" test now found in the 2003 Designs Act: Report No 74, Designs (1995) (the "ALRC Report").</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The ALRC addressed the issue in the following terms: 
5.8 Meaning of distinctive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Distinctiveness is a term used by the courts to express the quality that a design must have to differentiate it sufficiently from previously published or used designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">For example the courts have said
 
 
for a design to be protected there must be a special or distinctive appearance, something in the design which captures and appeals to the eye.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">To have that effect, the design must be noticeable and have some perceptible appearance of an individual character: [ Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (1989) AIPC 90-569 , 38, 975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">In another case, relating to furniture design, it was said that design in such a field is a subtle thing and, provided it is distinctive to the trained eye, I think that registration should not be denied in view of the element of subtlety which is involved in the combination of old features in a particular way and the manner in which they are combined: D Sebel &amp; Co Ltd v National Art Metal Co Pty Ltd (1965) 10 FLR 224, 227; approved in Australian Building Industries Pty Ltd v Woodman McDonald (Glass) Pty Ltd [1986] AIPC 90-302.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">] 
 
 
Other cases have spoken of 'the overall distinctive appearance of the registered design' [ Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors (Vic) Pty Ltd (1987) AIPC para 37, 634, 638] the ridging or grooving of a design being 'sufficiently bold and distinctive in its appeal to the eye', [ Aluminum Specialities Pty Ltd v Ibis Building Products Pty Ltd ( 1982) 42 ALR 127 , 133] a shape or configuration that is 'distinctly different' from that in respect of which a design is registered [ Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] AIPC para 90-616, 39, 334, 348] and a design that must be 'distinct and must present an appearance that strikes the eye as being different' [ Fisher LJ &amp; Co Ltd v Fabtile Industries Pty Ltd (1979) 49 AOJP 3611] ...
 
 
5.9 Grounds for adopting the new test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The [ALRC] favours the two tiered approach and the distinctiveness test for several reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The distinctiveness test is a design approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">It recognises the importance of design in product differentiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It is consistent with the way in which designers work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It will discourage the tendency to focus narrowly on 'one individual specific appearance' and to count up the differences between designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">It incorporates in a single concept many of the qualities sought in other unsatisfactory expressions such as 'judged by the eye', 'eye appeal', 'immaterial detail', 'trade variants', and 'obvious adaptation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">It is a more focussed test for assessing the degree to which a design is an advance on the prior art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">It allows a different prior art base to be defined for novelty as against distinctiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">This is useful because the aim with the novelty test is to exclude identical designs but the aim with the distinctiveness test is to recognise innovation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">It directly addresses the need for greater differentiation between designs, both for registration and infringement purposes, that was evidenced by submissions, consultations and the [ALRC's] survey of design users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">(Some formatting altered; footnotes moved to text in brackets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">)
 
 The ALRC Report formed the basis of the 2003 Designs Act: Explanatory Memorandum to the Designs Bill 2002 (Cth) at 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Under the 2003 Designs Act, a design is distinctive "unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design" as it existed before the priority date of each Design: s 16(2) (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">As noted earlier, that test has an important temporal aspect: anything which occurs after the priority date (the filing date of the application for registration) is irrelevant: s 16(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Secondly, contrary to the Respondents' submissions, distinctiveness is to be assessed not by comparing the design in question to the prior art base as a whole but by comparing it individually to each relevant piece of prior art: s 15(1) read with ss 16(1) and (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Part 4 of Chapter 2 of the 2003 Designs Act must be read as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The Respondents cannot, as they do, simply selectively choose ss 15(1) and 19(2) to support their contention that a comparison is made of the design with the totality of the entire relevant prior art base for that design whilst ignoring the express words of the rest of Pt 4 including ss 16 and 19(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It is those sections which expressly provide that a design is distinctive unless it is substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">As a result, a design that combines various features, each of which can be found in the prior art base when considered as a whole but not in any one particular piece of prior art, is capable of being distinctive: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [60] ; Karen Millen Ltd v Dunnes Stores Ltd [2008] ECDR 11 at [82]-[84] (stating that the registered design must be assessed with regard to particular prior designs rather than a hypothetical amalgam of a number of prior designs).</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">See also Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 (upholding the validity in the patent context of a combination of features known collectively in the prior art).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Thirdly, the judgment is an objective one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">In assessing substantial similarity in overall impression, the standard to be applied is that of the informed user - namely, the court standing in the shoes of a notional person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates: s 19(4); Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; see also Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corporation Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 , 408-409.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">That informed user , in assessing substantial similarity in overall impression: gives more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them: s 19(1); considers the state of development of the prior art base for the design: s 19(2)(a); considers the particular visual features of the design described in the statement of newness and distinctiveness in the context in which they appear: s 19(2)(b) and (c); if only part of the design is substantially similar to another design, considers the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole: s 19(2)(c); and considers the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate: s 19(2)(d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The "informed user" concept in the 2003 Designs Act has been the subject of recent judicial consideration in Australia: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [19] - [27] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It is a concept the ALRC borrowed from European Community Design law, now codified in Council Regulation (EC) No.</sentence>

<sentence id="s254">The "informed user" concept has also been considered by the courts in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In Woodhouse UK plc v Architectural Lighting Systems [2006] RPC 1 at [59], Judge Fysh QC of the Patents County Court defined an informed use r in the following terms: 
First, this notional person must obviously be a user of articles of the sort which is subject of the registered design - and I would think, a regular user at that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">He could thus be a consumer or buyer or be otherwise familiar with the subject matter say, through use at work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The quality smacks of practical considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">In my view the informed user is first, a person to whom the design is directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Evidently he is not a manufacturer of the articles and both counsel roundly rejected the candidature of "the man in the street".</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">" Informed " to my mind adds a notion of familiarity with the relevant rather more than what one might expect of the average consumer; it imports the notion of "what's about in the market?</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">" and "what has been about in the recent past?</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">" I do not think it requires an archival mind (or eye) or more than an average memory but it does I think demand some awareness of product trend and availability and some knowledge of basic technical considerations (if any).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In connection with the latter, one must not forget that we are in the territory of designs and thus what matters most is the appearance of things; as Mr Davis reminded me, these are not petty patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Therefore, focus on eye appeal seems more pertinent than familiarity with the underlying operational or manufacturing technology (if any).</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">I feel uncomfortable with analogy to the "man skilled in the art" whose "nerd-like" (and other) attributes seem too technical: Technip France SA's Patent [2004] EWCA Civ 381 ; [2004] R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">46 at [6-12] ( CA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">This formulation was considered and approved by Lewison J in Proctor &amp; Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [31], [32] and [41] and was also applied in Application by Pauline Ann Walton to invalidate UK Registered Design in the name of Zap Ltd [2007] ECDR 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">To the extent that it matters (and it might not), the Australian Designs Office ("the ADO") has indicated that the informed user concept is an objective test where the user is an ordinary or typical member of a sample of users of the product who is reasonably informed, being neither barely informed nor fully expert: Apple Computer Inc (2007) 74 IPR 164 and Icon Plastics Pty Ltd [2007] ADO 2 as discussed in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [25] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Although it would be dangerous to attempt some comprehensive statement of principles that might be applied to the concept, it is apparent that an informed user : is reasonably informed; not an expert but more informed than an average consumer; is an objective standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">However, expert evidence may still be adduced in court to assist the Court in applying the informed user concept; focuses on visual features and is not concerned with internal features or features that are not visible to the naked eye.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">In the present case, the Respondents accept that each Design is new when compared to the prior art base as it existed before the priority date of each Design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The question which then arises is whether each Design is distinctive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">In order to answer that question, two sub-questions arise for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">What was the prior art base before the priority date of each Design?</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">What are the visual features of each Design?</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The prior art in evidence was extensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The Respondents placed specific reliance upon the following prior art base products: the products depicted in the Narva Catalogue 2000/2001; the Britax "Squircular"; the products depicted in the Britax catalogue 2000/2001; the products depicted in the Narva Catalogue 2004/2005 (except those marked "new"); some of the products depicted in the Hella Catalogue 2003/2004; SYK Catalogue and products; and LED Tech's single-lens LED lamp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Before turning to consider the prior art base, at this point in the argument it is important to remember that the Respondents accept that the following distinctions existed between the prior art base (which, incorrectly, they would have considered as a whole) and the Designs: the absence of visible screws; the different visual features of the rear or base views of the Designs; the "cut-out" or "recess" at the end of a lamp; and the sloping, rounded mounting bracket surrounding the lenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The question is whether an informed user - a person familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates, and having regard to those matters listed in [56] above - would consider a Design with the distinct features listed in [62] as substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design?</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">In my view, such a person would not consider either Design to be substantially similar in overall impression to a design that forms part of the prior art base for the design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">If one looks at the designs which comprise the prior art base, one can identify designs and products, including LED Tech's single-lens lamp, with some of the features found in each of the Designs - a lens separate from the base and from each other, a low profile with an open base and no visible screws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">However, none of those designs include all or most of the features listed in [62] above, being features described in the statement of newness and distinctiveness for each of the Designs: see [2] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">For example, if one looks at LED Tech's single-lens lamp, it is apparent that, apart from the absence of visible screws, the product contains none of the other features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">If one turns to consider the state of development of the prior art base, each of the Designs and the features described in the statement of newness and distinctiveness was a distinct advance over the prior art base in the sense that it combined various existing features in a way that had not been done before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">On application to register each Design, the advances recorded in those Designs over the prior art base were substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">And, as was acknowledged by Mr Garrard, each of the features listed in [62] was quite arbitrary from a design point of view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">That is to say, the features were the product of conscious design choice rather than compelled by industry-wide standards or technological constraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Contrary to the Respondents' contentions, the visual features chosen by Mr Ottobre were not "so little different from the designs available in the prior art base" as to be substantially similar in overall impression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Visually the product was different --- it was modern and streamlined with curved edges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">No product in the prior art base incorporated all (or most) of the features listed in [62] in one product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">In those circumstances, I do not consider that a person familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates, would consider either Design as substantially similar in overall impression to any of the designs that form part of the prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">In considering the prior art base and the issue of whether each Design is substantially similar in overall impression to any of the designs that form part of the prior art base, the Respondents submitted that it was necessary to consider a product comprising several of LED Tech's single-lens lamps set side by side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Although at least one witness, Mr Carpenter, gave evidence that he had seen LED's single lenses installed side by side on vehicles, it was by no means clear when he saw such a configuration or what the precise configuration as to number and composition looked like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">That lack of detail is probably fatal to the contention that each Design is substantially similar in overall impression to an arrangement of LED Tech's single-lens lamps side by side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Furthermore, even if I were to assume, hypothetically, that a person had physically abutted two or three of LED Tech's single-lens lamps side by side before the priority date of each Design and that such a creation constituted a design publicly used in Australia within the meaning of s 15(2) so as to make it a part of the prior art base, I do not consider that a person familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates, would consider each Design to be substantially similar in overall impression to such a configuration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Instead of one continuous base along the long axis, there would be two or three bases with no flat strip or landing between each lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">And the sides of each base would not comprise a sloping, rounded mounting bracket surrounding a lens but would have vertical or straight sidewalls surrounding each lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The underside of the bases would be different in shape, with mounting holes in different positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">For those reasons as well, the cross-claimants' contention of substantial similarity is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">E. INFRINGEMENT 
 LED Tech contends that the Condor Designs with code numbers TL80RA, TL80RRA / TL80ARR, TL80ARW, TL100 ARR / TL80RAA, TL100ARW, TL125 AAR / TL125 RRA and TL125 ARW ("the Condor Products") infringe the Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">It is common ground that the Condor Designs are not identical to the Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The question then is whether the Condor Products embody designs that are "substantially similar in overall impression" to the Designs: s 71(1)(a) of the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The 2003 Designs Act was drafted so that the test of whether an allegedly infringing product is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design is the same test applied to determine whether a design was distinctive for registration purposes: ALRC Report pars 5.22-5.23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">As the ALRC said, "[T]he infringement and distinctiveness tests should be the same so that an infringing design is not a distinctive design and vice versa": para 5.22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Adopting the same test for distinctiveness and infringement broadens the scope of protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The extent of difference required to make a design distinctive will depend on the state of development of the relevant prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">A more developed prior art base will mean that smaller differences will be sufficient to result in a finding that there is no substantial similarity: para 5.23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">How then does one assess the overall impression of a design in infringement proceedings?</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">As noted earlier, until recently there has been little Australian judicial consideration of the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">The principal cases to date include Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 and World of Technologies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Tempo (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 71 IPR 307.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The principles set out in [53]-[59] are equally applicable in the infringement context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">As s 71 of the 2003 Designs Act (read with s 19) makes clear, the court assesses whether the allegedly infringing design is substantially similar in overall impression to the registered design by comparing the allegedly infringing product to the registered design in the context of the whole appearance of the designs: see also ALRC Report para 6.25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The whole appearance is relevant as the context for the design even though, strictly, the design is only the distinctive visual features of the product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Greater weight is given to distinctive features than to other parts of the design, although still in the context of the whole of the appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The same principles of assessment apply where the distinctive features relate only to part of the design: ss 19(2)(b)(ii) and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Moreover, in determining whether a design is infringed the Court must give more weight to similarities between the designs than to differences between them: s 19(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">This legislative approach to the question of infringement ensures that courts assess infringement in the context of the whole appearance of competing designs rather than focusing on the differences between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">In addition, the scheme of the 2003 Designs Act requires the Court looking through the eyes of an informed user to consider: the state of development of the relevant prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">As stated earlier, one measure is whether the difference in distinctiveness between the Design and any previously known design is greater than the difference between the Design and the allegedly infringing design: s 19(2)(a); the new and distinctive features of the design: s 19(2)(b)(i); where only part of a design is substantially similar to another design, the amount, quality and importance of that part in the context of the design as a whole: s 19(2)(c); the freedom of the creator of the design to innovate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">In other words, the nature and use of a product, or part of it, is a factor in defining the scope of the designer's freedom to choose shape and materials: s 19(2)(d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">There is little doubt that first impressions are important when comparing a registered design with an allegedly infringing product in the manner prescribed by the 2003 Designs Act: ALRC Report para 5.15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">In the United Kingdom, in applying an "overall impression" test, the approach is to hold a product embodying the registered design (provided that the Court is satisfied that it is a true embodiment of the registered design) and the alleged infringing product in hand and undertake a reasonably careful comparison between the two: Proctor &amp; Gamble Company 73 IPR 605 at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">See also J Choo (Jersey) Ltd v Towerstone Ltd [2008] FSR 19 at [6] (citing Proctor &amp; Gamble for the proposition that court may have regard to a physical embodiment of the registered design in making the comparison to the allegedly infringing product); but see Rolawn Lawn Ltd v Turfmech Machinery Ltd [2008] EWHC 989 Pat at [124] (stating that the exercise involves comparing the registered design to a photograph of the allegedly infringing product rather than the product itself).</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">With respect, I disagree with the proposition that as a general matter a court should start out by comparing product with product rather than registered design with product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">First and most importantly, such an approach is inconsistent with the statutory language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Section 71(1)(a) directs the court to perform the substantial similarity analysis by comparing a product (the allegedly infringing item) to the registered design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Secondly, Jacob LJ's approach is inconsistent with that taken by Kenny J in Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [28] , [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Significantly, the expert evidence in Review was challenged on the basis that the witness had improperly compared product with product (and had even tried the products on): see [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Although Kenny J ultimately allowed the evidence, her Honour nevertheless proceeded on the basis that the comparison for the court was between registered design and product and the expert evidence in question had to be taken subject to the complaints made by the other side: see [34]-[36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">I am of a similar view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">While there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate (or at least not wholly inappropriate) for an expert witness giving evidence as an informed user to have regard to a product embodying the registered design in providing an opinion on the substantial similarity question, the task for the court itself as laid down by the statute remains to compare the registered design to the allegedly infringing product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Moreover, even if I were not inclined to the view of Kenny J, I could not, in light of the statutory language, consider her Honour's approach plainly wrong, and thus I would follow it in preference to Jacob LJ's approach in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">I therefore conclude that infringement is determined by comparing the allegedly infringing product against the registered design, not by comparing a product embodying the registered design against the infringing product: s 71.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Thus the fact that the actual LED light is similar to the Condor TL light is not relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Moreover, infringement is determined by comparing only the visible features of the design to the infringing product: ss 7 and 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Thus the fact that the products have different materials in the lens or have different voltages is also irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">If a visual comparison is made of the top view of a Condor product (such as the TL80ARW) against the registered design (eg figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 of 6 in Annexure A), the Condor product is "substantially similar in overall impression" to the Designs: s 71(1)(a) of the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">There is a continuous base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">There is a flat strip or landing between each lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The sides of the base of both the Designs and the Condor product comprise a sloping, rounded mounting bracket surrounding the lenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">It is true that the Condor Products contain visible screws while the statement of newness and distinctiveness accompanying the Designs emphasises the "no visible screws" feature of the Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, although the Condor product contains two screws in each flat strip or landing between each lens, it is not a feature which in my view substantially distinguishes the Condor product from the registered Design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The presence of the screws does not create a different "visual appeal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The screws are the same colour as the flat strip or landing between each lens and sit low in the socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">They are not "visual" screws as one would describe the screws in some of prior art such as the Narva Model 48 94840 or Hella 2400, where the screws are chrome in colour and protruding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Figures 5 and 6 of the Design are of the rear view of the Design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Upon a visual comparison of the rear view of the same Condor product against figures 5 and 6 of the Design, the Condor product is "substantially similar in overall impression" to the Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Again, there is one base with rounded corners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">There is an opening for each lens of similar shapes with the shapes in the same configuration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">There is the same number of mounting holes for the screws and the holes are in the same position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Moreover, as Mr Garrard properly conceded at trial, the Condor Products are much closer to the Designs than they are to LED Tech's own single-lens LED lamp which forms part of the prior art base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">For those reasons, the Condor Product with the code number TL80RA infringes Design No.302359 --- dual lens and each of the Condor Products with the code numbers, TL80RRA / TL80ARR, TL80ARW, TL100 ARR / TL80RAA, TL100ARW, TL125AAR / TL125 RRA and TL125 ARW infringe Design No.302360 --- triple lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Having determined that the Condor Products infringe the Designs it is necessary to consider the question of relief and whether the respondents have an affirmative defence under s 75(2) of the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">F. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENCE: S 75(2) OF THE 2003 DESIGNS ACT 
 Strictly speaking, the Respondents did not (and could not) plead a s 75 affirmative defence because they had "taken advice" (that is, they were aware that LED Tech's products were the subject of registered design protection and had in fact sought legal advice as to whether their own products would infringe).</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">However, they did raise s 75 in the context of their argument (considered at [32]-[50] above) about the Register and invalidity of the Designs due to the uncertainty of the representations contained therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Because s 75 does inform the debate about the limits of the monopoly conferred by registration under the 2003 Designs Act (an Act which has to be construed as a whole), it is therefore still useful to examine it (operating under the assumption that the Respondents had not "taken advice") in order to see whether the Respondents could otherwise have made out the defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Section 75(2) of the 2003 Designs Act provides an affirmative defence to infringement in the discretion of the court: 
(2) The court may refuse to award damages, reduce the damages that would otherwise be awarded, or refuse to make an order for an account of profits, if the defendant satisfies the court: 
 
 
(a) in the case of primary infringement: 
 
 
(i) that at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware that the design was registered; and
 
 
(ii) that before that time, the defendant had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain whether the design was registered; or 
 
 
(b) in the case of secondary infringement--that at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware, that the design was registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The first question to be resolved is whether each of the respondents is a primary infringer (ie someone who makes an infringing product s 75(5) read with s 71(1)(a)) or a secondary infringer (ie someone who engages in any other infringing conduct s 75(5) read with s 71(1)(b)-(e)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">In Review Australia Pty Ltd v Innovative Lifestyle Investments Pty Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 358 ( Innovative ), Jessup J concluded that the word make in s 71(1) also includes those who direct, cause, or procure an infringing item to be made as well as those who make such an item themselves: Innovative at [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">At first glance, therefore, it would seem that Ren and Olsen would be considered primary infringers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Although they did not make the products themselves, they directed, caused, or procured the Condor lights to be made by issuing purchase orders to their Chinese suppliers based on samples, designs, or other specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Elecspess and AAA, having only sold the products, would be secondary infringers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">I say "at first glance," however, because in the Review cases, Kenny J added an important qualification to Jessup J's holding in Innovative .</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Her Honour noted the long-standing common law presumption, codified in s 21(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), that statutes are to be read as being confined to their operation within territorial limits: Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [77] ; Review Australia Pty Ltd v New Cover Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1589 at [48] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Although the Respondents in this case did not raise any extraterritoriality issue, I consider it appropriate to do so because the parties did not have the benefit of Kenny J's judgment at the time of trial and because the issue relates to the Court's jurisdiction - that is, it goes to a matter in respect of which the Court is required to satisfy itself regardless of the parties' submissions or lack thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">In my view, Kenny J was correct in concluding that operation of the 2003 Designs Act must, in the absence of clear legislative guidance to the contrary, be confined to the territory of this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">To hold otherwise would risk improperly subjecting unwitting foreign companies (assuming a plaintiff could satisfy personal jurisdiction, service of process and other procedural requirements) to liability in Australia for acts which might be perfectly legal in terms of their own domestic intellectual property regimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">It would be tantamount to holding that a company which does business wholly within foreign borders ought to be charged, when doing business with an Australian client, with knowledge of Australian design law as well as a duty under that law to verify the provenance of designs provided to it for manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">For those reasons, Ren and Olsen could not be considered primary infringers, even though they procured the making of the infringing Condor lights, because the actual manufacture occurred outside of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">That is not to say that they would therefore escape liability completely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Rather, each of Elecspess, AAA, Ren and Olsen must be considered secondary infringers on the basis of their having imported (in the case of Ren and Olsen) or offered for sale (in the case of all four) in Australia the infringing Condor lights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">I would consider the Director Respondents as secondary infringers as well, on a similar basis as that given by Jessup J in Innovative - namely, that importing or selling, as the case may be, should be understood to also include directing, causing, or procuring an infringing item to be imported or sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The relevant provision of s 75 is therefore s 75(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">That subsection requires the court to consider, in determining whether an affirmative defence is available, whether a secondary infringer was aware or could not reasonably have been expected to have been aware that the design was registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Assuming that Ren and Olsen in fact had taken no steps to ascertain whether the Designs were registered at the time of the infringing conduct, that fact alone might not have disentitled them to rely upon the affirmative defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The language of s 75(2)(b) ("could reasonably have been expected to be aware") shows that a Court cannot assume that there is always an affirmative duty to search the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Such a possibility was referred to by the ALRC at par 14.16 of its Report in the following terms: 
The register provides notice to the world that a design is registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">If a defendant has not searched the register, the court may conclude under s 32B that a search was a reasonable step that the defendant had neglected to take .</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">It should not be mandatory for persons who claim innocence in infringement to search the register .</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">However in exercising its discretion, the court may take into account whether it was reasonable in all the circumstances for a search to have been conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">(Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">)
 
 The ALRC added at par 14.17, "It would be inappropriate for a retailer or importer, who may deal with a variety of products, to be required to check whether the products' designs have all been registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">" I accept that it would be inappropriate to impose a per se duty on secondary infringers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">However, in my view, there will be circumstances where a secondary infringer should reasonably be expected to check whether the products' designs have been registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">If, having checked, they would have ascertained the limits of the monopoly (which is the case here), then they would not be able to make out the affirmative defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The question is therefore whether, in all the circumstances, it would have been reasonable in this case for the Respondents to have searched the Register?</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">In my view, it would have been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">That conclusion is dependent on two findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">First, having regard to the substantial similarity between the Designs and the Condor Products and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonably open to infer that a representative of Ren and Olsen (and for that matter, AAA and Elecspess) saw the commercial embodiment of the Design: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Secondly and more importantly, the commercial embodiments of the Designs, in both their packaged and unpackaged form, contain a form of notice that would give rise at least to a duty to check the name LED Technologies on the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The notice is at the foot of the packaging and comprises the words "Registered Design".</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The rear of the base of each lamp has embossed on it a further notice, "Design Certificate Registration Number [NUMBER STATED].</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">" There is no suggestion here that the notification on LED Tech's packaging was defective for s 75 purposes in any of the ways described by Kenny J or Jessup J: see Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1588 at [80] - [81] (accepting that a design notification affixed to the product, such as a swing tag, could be sufficient to put a potential infringer on notice but finding on the facts that there was not such notice at the relevant time); and Innovative at [48]-[52] (finding that the swing tag did put the infringer on notice, but refusing to take the notification into account in determining damages because the tag was misleading in part).</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Accordingly, none of the Respondents could make out an affirmative defence under s 75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">G. RELIEF

 Before turning to consider LED Tech's claim for damages, a number of matters must be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">First, LED Tech's claim (set out in the table) proceeds on a false assumption that LED Tech lost every sale secured by Ren and Olsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">The assumption is false because, among other things, the prices of the respective products were not the same, nor was it established that both sides' products were stocked in the same places, such that a customer not able to obtain one would automatically turn to the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Ultimately, LED Tech properly conceded that the underlying assumption was not accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Notwithstanding the concession, LED Tech submitted that because it was "a significant established player in the market", it would have secured a significant number of those sales and the calculation provides a "yardstick of comparison".</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">On any view, however, LED Tech is not entitled to the whole of the amount claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Secondly, LED Tech made no claim for general damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Thirdly, the amount of LED Tech's margin was not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">However, in relation to the TL80 series, it is important to realise that LED Tech produced two products in each of the 80 series.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Each product had a different margin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">All parties adopted the average of the margins in calculating damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">How then are damages to be assessed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">The Corporate Respondents contend that if LED Tech is entitled to the sales made by them at the margins specified by LED Tech, then the damages would be as follows: Condor Product Ren Units sold Sept 2006 --- June 2007 Olsen Units Sold July 2007 --- May 2008 Total Agreed Margin Total TL 80 Series 
 
 
 
 
 AR 0 1,708 1,708 $25.10 $42,862 ARR 0 11 11 $31.98 $352 ARW 338 869 1,207 $46.98 $56,699 100 Series 
 
 
 
 
 ARR 0 0 0 $63.58 0 ARW 396 291 687 $77.71 $53,387 125 Series 
 
 
 
 
 ARR 0 0 0 $76.72 0 ARW 108 283 391 $101.65 $39,745 
 
 
 
 
 $193,045.00 
 The difference between the two tables reflects that LED Tech's figures for units "sold" pre-recall (when Ren was selling the TL Series) are based on invoices of products purchased from the Chinese manufacturer, not the units sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The Respondents used the number of units in fact sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">For the period in which Olsen sold the units, LED Tech estimated the number of units "sold" by taking the actual monthly sales (in $) of each product recorded in the respondents' expert's report and then dividing those sales by the average cost of each unit in a stock report to obtain an estimate of the number of units sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">On the other hand, the Respondents used the monthly sales (showing both volume and amount ($) of sales) for Ren and Olsen since July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Unsurprisingly, the numbers of units sold do not coincide and the discrepancy cannot be resolved based on the evidence before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">That is, I do not consider that it would be a useful expenditure of the Court's time (assuming that it were in fact possible on the evidence) to seek to arrive at a precise number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">This is particularly so in light of the false one-to-one lost sales premise; no evidence was adduced that would give the Court the ability to calculate a precise discount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In the circumstances, the better approach is to assess damages doing the best I can, even if such quantification necessarily involves a degree of speculation and guesswork: eg Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [37] - [38] ; Adidas-Solomon AG v Turner (2003) 58 IPR 66 at [4]-[5]; Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd (1984) 57 ALR 167 , 183; Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Applying that approach, I consider that it is fair, based on the evidence to which I have referred, to assess damages at the amount contended for by the Respondents, rounded up to $200,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">I do so for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">First, the figures in the table at [98] were submitted by the Respondents on the basis that the sum of $193,045 was the "limit (maximum) of the ... monetary relief as far as the evidence permits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">" Secondly, although even the Respondents' evidence appears to proceed on the incorrect one-to-one assumption identified earlier, having regard to the summary of sales attached to the expert's report, the number of units included in the table appears to be a conservative assessment of the number of units in fact sold by Ren and Olsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">In other words, I consider that the actual sales were higher and thus to award only $200,000 would in fact give the Respondents a discount in recognition of the fact that not all sales by them can properly be deemed lost sales of LED Tech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Before proceeding, I should note that none of the Corporate Respondents attempted to raise a claim of proportionate liability, nor was any evidence led in an attempt to segregate the sales on an individual company basis with respect to Elecspess and AAA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Subject to any agreement among the parties as to the form of final orders, I consider that in the circumstances the proper course at this stage is to proceed on the basis that damages should be assessed jointly and severally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Whether the Respondents come to some agreement among themselves is a matter for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">H. TRADE PRACTICES ACT CLAIMS AGAINST THE CORPORATE RESPONDENTS 
 As noted earlier, LED Tech contends that the Corporate Respondents, by their conduct, contravened ss 52 , 53 and 65C of the TPA and that the Directors authorised, directed and further or alternatively procured the conduct of the Third and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">LED Tech contends that, for differing periods of time, the Corporate Respondents offered for sale, and sold, in Australia Condor Products with the following product codes: Single Lamps - TL80A (amber indicator), TL80R (red stop / position) and TL80W (white reversing); Dual LED Assemblies - TL80 RA (red / amber); Triple LED Assemblies - TL80 RRA / TL80 ARR, TL80 ARW, TL100 ARR / TL 80RRA, TL100ARW, TL125AAR / TL125 RRA, TL125 ARW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">There is no dispute that each of Elecspess, AAA, Ren and Olsen offered for sale and sold LED automotive lamps branded "Condor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The role of each of the Corporate Respondent, however, was different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Prior to 1 July 2007, the Condor Products were imported by Ren and distributed by Olsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Ren's only independent distributors were Brytec Pty Ltd and Elecspess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">After 1 July 2007, the position was reversed --- Olsen imported the products and Ren became the distributor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Throughout the period, Elecspess sold the Condor LED lamps through its own distribution network which included other automotive electrical distributors, auto electricians and OEMs ("Original Equipment Manufacturers") in the caravan and trailer industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">AAA was a retailer of Condor Products which it, in turn, had obtained from Elecspess and Brytec.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">LED Tech's principal complaint is that each of the products listed in [104] bore one of "Complies with ADR1", "Complies with ADR6" or "Complies with ADR 49" together with the phrase "ADR Approved" on the packaging ("the Captions") and that the representations conveyed by those Captions were misleading and deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">There were, in fact, a number of versions of those products imported into Australia and sold by Ren, Olsen, Elecspess and AAA - Version 1, Version 2 and Version 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Version 1
 Version 1 lamps were obtained from Asian Access, a company which later changed its name to China Trailer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">In June and November 2006, Ren placed orders for Version 1 lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">There were two shipments of lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Ren received the first shipment in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Brytec placed the first order for Version 1 lamps with Ren in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Ren supplied the lamps to Brytec, which onsold them to Elecspess for subsequent sale and distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The second shipment of Version 1 lamps was received by Ren in January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">All Version 1 lamps had the words "Complies with ADR 1/6/49" stamped on the face of the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Mr Ottobre obtained two examples of Version 1 lamps (TL80 RA and TL80 ARW) from Mr Carpenter of Elecspess in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">In or about March 2007, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") intervened in the sale of these lamps with the result that the sale of Version 1 lamps ceased and the Version 1 lamps were recalled from the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">In June 2007, Elecspess gave certain undertakings to the ACCC and instigated a program to recall Version 1 lamps which had earlier been sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">There was, in fact, another version of these lights which were referred to in the proceedings as "Version 1A".</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">They differed slightly from Version 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">For present purposes, those differences are not material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Version 2
 The Version 2 lamps were manufactured by a new manufacturer, NM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The first shipment was received by Ren in late July or August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The lights were not packaged in blister packs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The second shipment (received in August 2007) and subsequent shipments were packaged in blister packs which contained a card showing details of the lamps and the words "ADR Approved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">All the lamps had the words "Complies with ADR" stamped on the face of the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Ren, Olsen and Elecspess admit that they sold LED automotive lamps branded "Condor" from about August 2007 in packaging bearing the words "ADR Approved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">AAA admits that it sold LED automotive lamps branded "Condor" from about September 2007 in packaging bearing the words "ADR Approved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Examples of Version 2 lamps were tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">A TL80ARW purchased on about 22 October 2007 and three lamps in February 2008 (TL80ARW, TL100ARW and a TL125 ARW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Version 3
 Version 3 lamps differ from Version 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Version 3 lamps have a different diffusion pattern on the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The lamps have the words "Condor Complies with ADR" stamped on the face of the lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Examples of the Version 3 lamps were purchased from Olsen on about 20 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">LED Tech's Contentions
 LED Tech contends that because of the Captions on all of the Condor Products, each of Elecspess, AAA, Ren and Olsen represented to the public and / or consumers of automotive lamps that each of the Condor Products: complies with the ADRs; and further or in the alternative is approved for the purpose of compliance with the ADRs, 
("the Representations").</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Further, LED Tech contends the Representations were false and misleading because the Condor Products: do not comply with ADR 1, which is concerned with the photometric requirements of reversing lamps; do not comply with ADR 6, which is concerned with the photometric requirements of direction indicators; do not comply with ADR 49, which is concerned with the photometric requirements for devices which signal to the road users the position, orientation and movement of the vehicle; were not approved for the purposes of compliance with the ADRs prior to October or November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">In considering these claims, it is first necessary to seek to explain the ADRs, their source and how they operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">I say "seek to explain" because the system is complex and the parties were in dispute not only about the way in which the system operated but what it is that the system requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Relevant Vehicle Standards
 The Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 (Cth) ("the MVSA") is the starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The objects of the MVSA are to achieve uniform vehicle standards for new vehicles and to regulate the supply of used imported vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Sections 14 and 18 of the MVSA prohibit the supply of new vehicles or importation of road vehicles that are non-standard or do not have an identification plate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">A "new vehicle" does not include a vehicle component: s 5 of the MVSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">An "identification plate" is a "plate declaring the status of a road vehicle in relation to the national standards and approved to be placed on vehicles of that type or description under procedures and arrangements provided for in subsection 10(1)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Section 10 provides: 
(1) The Minister may determine, from time to time, procedures and arrangements for the placement of plates on road vehicles or vehicle components if approval has been given under subsection 10A(1), (2) or (3) for plates to be placed on the vehicles or vehicle components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the Minister may determine procedures and arrangements in relation to identification plates, including procedures and arrangements with respect to: 
 
 
(a) the categories of identification plates to be utilised; and 
 
 
(b) the content, form and function of identification plates; and 
 
 
(c) the nature, content, sources and format of evidence to be presented to establish whether, and to what extent, a road vehicle or vehicle component complies with the national standards; and 
 
 
(d) the analysis, verification and supplementation of such evidence; and 
 
 
(e) the manner in which partly completed road vehicles are to be provided for; and 
 
 
(f) the manufacture and supply of identification plates; and 
 
 
(g) the placement of identification plates; and 
 
 
(h) the retention of records and information relevant to applications for, and the giving of, approvals under section 10A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">(3) A determination under this section is a legislative instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Section 10A provides that "[i]f new vehicles of a particular type, or vehicle components of a particular type, comply with the national standards, the Minister must give written approval for identification plates to be placed on vehicles or components of that type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">" There is no suggestion in the present case that any application was made to the Minister for approval for an identification plate to be placed on any of the Condor Products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The reference to "national standard" is a reference to a "vehicle standard" determined under s 7 of the MVSA: see s 5 and the definition of "national standard".</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">A "vehicle standard" is defined in s 5 of the MVSA to mean a safety, security, energy or emission "standard for road vehicles or vehicle components".</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Section 7 provides that "the Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine vehicle standards for road vehicles or vehicle components " (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The Minister may also, by legislative instrument, determine procedures for testing whether vehicles and components comply with the MVSA: s 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">These functions or powers are non-delegable: s 23 of the MVSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">"Vehicle component" is defined in s 5 to mean "a component to be used in the manufacture of a road vehicle, and includes a component of such a component".</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">A component includes an assembly: s 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Section 41 of the MVSA provides that: 
For the purpose of sections 65C ... and 65F of the [TPA], a national standard (including a standard designed for a purpose referred to in paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of vehicle standard in section 5 of this Act) is to be taken to be a prescribed consumer product safety standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">There is an Administrator of Vehicle Standards: s 22 of the MVSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">It is common ground that proof of vehicle standards is not required: s 143(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">The Minister has determined the following relevant standards as vehicle standards pursuant to s 7 of the MVSA: Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 1/00 --- Reversing Lamps) 2005 --- White dated 21 November 2005 ("ADR 1"), prescribes the photometric requirements for reversing lamps which will warn pedestrians and other road users that the vehicle is about to move or is moving in the reverse direction, and which during the hours of darkness will aid the driver in reversing manoeuvres; Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 6/00 --- Direction Indicators) 2005 --- Yellow / Amber dated 13 December 2006 ("ADR 6"), prescribes the photometric requirements for a device mounted on a motor vehicle or trailer which when operated by the driver signals the latter's intention to change the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding; Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 49/00 --- Front and Rear Position (Side) Lamps, Stop Lamps and End Outline Marker Lamps) 2005 --- Red dated 3 April 2007 ("ADR 49"), prescribes the photometric requirements for light-signalling devices which will indicate the presence, width and position of the vehicle when viewed from the front and from the rear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">
The determination accompanying ADR 1 suggests that the ADR was determined to be a vehicle standard under s 7(1) of the MVSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">No such provision exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">For the purposes of this analysis I have assumed that the determination was in fact made under s 7 of the MVSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">None of the parties suggested that this apparent error invalidated or otherwise altered the operation of the standard, and in any event the authorities hold that, as a general matter, judicial redrafting of obvious typographical errors is permitted: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 21-22; Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 , 305, 311, 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Application may be made to the Minister for approval of a vehicle component, being a component that is to be supplied to the market for the manufacture of a new vehicle being an approval that states that the component complies with particular national standards or relevant parts of particular national standards: reg 4 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations 1989 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It is not suggested that this form of approval was followed or had to be followed in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Before turning to consider the content and effect of the ADRs referred to above, reference should be made to two other items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">First, there is the "Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule --- Definitions and Vehicle Categories) 2005" which "set[s] out matters, such as definition of key terms, which apply in common to particular [ADRs]" and contains material which needs to be read in conjunction with particular ADRs in order to establish the rights and obligations which those ADRs create.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">In that ADR, "approved" is defined to mean "approved by the Administrator" but the ADR goes on to provide that where a term is defined within an ADR as well as in the list of defined terms, the definition in the ADR takes precedence for the purposes of the particular ADR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">I will turn to consider the relevant ADRs and their contents shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">The second item is in fact a group of items published by the Administrator and known as "Circulars".</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The Circulars do not have legislative or regulatory force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">The Court cannot have regard to them under s 143 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">What then is the status of the Circulars?</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">One was tendered in evidence (Circular 0-4-26).</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Others (Circulars 0-2-11, 0-3-2, 0-3-4, 0-3-6, 0-4-18, 0-12-0 and 0-13-1) were provided to the Court following the hearing, although leave to reopen for the purpose of tendering them was neither sought nor granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">I have read the Circulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">They do not contain matters "so generally known that every person may be reasonably presumed to be aware" of them: Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 9 ; (2002) 208 CLR 460 at [64] (per McHugh J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Accordingly, the Court cannot have regard to them under s 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Putting Circular 0-4-26 to one side, the other Circulars are therefore not properly before the Court and I have not relied on them in coming to the views expressed in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Circular 0-4-26 is entitled "Application for Component Registration Numbers (CRNs)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">It "sets out the requirements and conditions regarding the application for, and issuing of, [CRNs] for vehicle components": par 1.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Applicants for a CRN can be the component manufacturer, component supplier or the vehicle manufacturer: par 1.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">The CRN process is directed at registering vehicle components to be used in new motor vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">The Department of Transport and Regional Services (now known as the Department of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Services) ("DOTARS") creates a register of components that are commonly used in new vehicles for administrative convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">The Circular provides that the Administrator of Vehicle Standards will accept CRNs as evidence of compliance in Summary of Evidence submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">What those submissions are or the use to which they are put, is not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">In any event, CRNs will only be issued for components that are fitted to new motor vehicles or trailers (par 1.4) and for, inter alia, "(i) Lighting and light signalling devices (various ADRs)": par 1.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">However, CRNs will not be issued for lighting and light-signalling devices using UNECE (United Nations Economic Committee for Europe) regulation approvals (par 1.7) or for components exclusively for the aftermarket (par 1.8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The Circular then goes on to specify the manner in which an applicant applies for a CRN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">For example, a separate application is required for each Make-Model and, in the case of combined lighting and signalling devices, separate applications are also required for each different function (eg stop, position or indicator): par 2.4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The application procedures are prescribed: section 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Applicants for CRNs must first register with the Road Vehicle Certification System ("RVCS") as a Licensee: par 3.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">An application for a CRN for a Make-Model must consist of a number of nominated forms including what is described as "the relevant SE forms for the particular ADR" and a letter from the new vehicle manufacturer that would be fitting the component: par 3.4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">An application that has demonstrated compliance with the relevant ADR will be granted a CRN: par 3.8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">CRN documentation is then issued to the CRN holder for information and safe keeping: par 3.8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The Circular goes on to provide that where there are changes in the specification of a component during the production life of the component, it is the responsibility of the CRN holder to ensure the continued compliance of any revised specification component with the relevant ADR: par 5.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The fact of continued compliance is required to be documented and available for inspection by inspectors if requested: par 5.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">In particular, if a running change to an approved component is likely to have an impact on ADR compliance, the component will need to be re-tested and the results lodged: par 5.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">On the other hand, a running change to an approved component that does not impact on its ADR compliance may be implemented without the prior approval of the Administrator: par 5.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Finally, the Circular states that CRN holders are expected to put in place a Quality Plan to ensure that only the specified approved components are identified with the CRNs granted: par 8.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Components that are in any way different from those described in the final form of the applications for CRNs shall not be supplied under those CRNs: par 8.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Once marketing of the specified components in Australia has ceased, CRN holders are required to notify the Administrator of Vehicle Standards of the date of manufacture of the last specified components supplied to the market in Australia: par 9.1 The interaction, both legally and practically, between the Circular and the system it describes and the ADRs identified above is in issue because (1) LED Tech submitted that the words "ADR Approved" have a prescribed meaning, namely that the product was approved by the Administrator of Vehicle Standards, and none of the Condor Products had such approval and (2) LED Tech alleges that each of Elecspess, Olsen, AAA and Ren contravened s 65C(1) of the TPA because they supplied lamps used, or likely to be used, by a consumer in respect of which there was a prescribed consumer product safety standard (the ADRs) with which the products do not comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">As noted earlier, the approval process for components provided for by the MVSA (see [124] above) was not adopted and can be put to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The question which then arises is what is the status of the CRN procedure outlined in Circular 0-4-26 and the interaction between that Circular and the ADRs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">With respect to the ADRs, it is clear that by virtue of ss 5 , 7 and 41 of the MVSA they are prescribed consumer product safety standards for purposes of s 65C of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Circular 0-4-26 purports to create a system for demonstrating compliance with those safety standards in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">In the Subject Index of Circulars issued by the Administrator, the Circular is listed under the heading "Certification Procedure".</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">However, it must be remembered that power to set procedures and arrangements for determining compliance with the Act belongs to the Minister, not the Administrator, and cannot be delegated: ss 9, 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Presumably that is why Circular 0-4-26 states that a CRN is merely evidence a manufacturer of new vehicles can rely upon in demonstrating compliance with an ADR; however, it does not and cannot in itself establish compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Therefore, the fact that a person may hold a CRN in respect of a particular vehicle component does not of itself legally entitle the holder to claim compliance or approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Moreover, as noted earlier, Circular 0-4-26 does not purport to create a generally applicable "compliance" procedure - it provides that CRNs will only be issued for components that are fitted to new motor vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">It is not relevant to the aftermarket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Putting aside for the moment the fact that there appears to be no generally applicable or conclusive administrative procedure for establishing ADR compliance, it is also necessary to consider the substance of the standard itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">What standard then do the ADRs require?</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Although each ADR provides a standard for different types of lamps, so far as is relevant, each of the relevant ADRs is in similar terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">I will use ADR 1 as the example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">As noted earlier, the scope of ADR 1 is to "prescribe ... the photometric requirements for reversing lamps which will warn pedestrians and other road users that the vehicle is about to move or is moving in the reverse direction, and which during the hours of darkness will aid the driver in reversing manoeuvres": Pt 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The standard then specifies that devices complying with the technical requirements of Appendix A as varied by Pt 5 Exemptions and Alternative Procedures and Pt 6 Supplementary General Requirements shall be accepted as complying with the ADR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Appendix A is, in fact, UNECE Regulation No 23/00, the Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Reversing Lamps for Power Driven Vehicles and their Trailers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">In general terms, Pt 5 of the Regulation provides that certain provisions of Appendix A are not applicable and Pt 6 provides that certain requirements are supplementary to the requirements of Appendix A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Paragraph 6.1 of the ADR entitled "Supplementary General requirements" provides that "the requirements and procedures set out in Annexes 5 and 6 of Appendix A are acceptable for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the technical requirements of this rule".</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The reference to Annex 6 is in fact a reference to Annex 6 as amended by par 5.1 of the Regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">In addition to compliance in that manner, par 7.1 provides that the technical requirements of any of the editions of the UNECE Regulation No 23/00 are deemed to be equivalent to the technical requirements of this rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Such a provision is unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Part 5 of the ADR substantially amends and, most importantly, substantially weakens UNECE Regulation No 23/00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">In particular, the amendments removed from the UNECE Regulation sections 2, 3 and 4 headed "Application for Approval", "Markings" and "Approval".</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">That is significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Those sections prescribed not only a process for approval but standards to be met to obtain "approval" which are significantly more stringent than those set out in Annex 5 and 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">In other words, the substantive standard to which the CRN process in Circular 0-4-26 applies is much less rigorous than the UNECE Regulation No 23/00 and compliance with the higher standard necessarily means compliance with the Australian standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">However, the question remains, what then is the Australian standard?</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">One thing that does not inform the answer to this question is industry practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">A deal of evidence was led as to what automotive industry experts thought the ADRs required and how the industry tested for compliance in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The general thrust of this evidence was that the industry treated much of the removed sections as still being applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">However, as the Court stated in MHG Plastic Industries v ACCC (2000) ATPR (Digest) 46-206 at [49], any industry practice adopted as to the testing of products against a safety standard cannot affect the proper construction of the requirements under the safety standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">As Emmett J said at first instance in that decision ( ACCC v MHG Plastic Industries Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-712 at [22]), " The Standard means what it says" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Paragraph 6.1 of the Regulation stipulates that "the requirements and procedures set out in Annexes 5 and 6 of Appendix A are acceptable for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the technical requirements of this rule".</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Annexure 5 in turn states, "The conformity requirements shall be considered satisfied from a mechanical and geometric standpoint if the differences do not exceed inevitable manufacturing deviations within the stipulated requirements": Annexure 5 at 1.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">In relation to photometric requirements, no measured value can deviate unfavourably by more than 20% from the prescribed values .</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The values are prescribed in section 6 of Appendix A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">By way of example, the light intensity requirements prescribed in paragraphs 6.2, 6.3 and 6.5 of Appendix A will be satisfied by the following measurements: Para No Measurement Prescribed Value Permissible deviation 6.2 Intensity along the axis Not less than 80 candelas Not less than 64 (80 - 20%) candelas 6.3 Intensity of light in all directions in which light can be observed 
 
 
 Directions in or above the horizontal plane Not exceed 300 candelas Not exceed 360 (300 +20%) candelas 
 Directions below the horizontal plane Not exceed 600 candelas Not exceed 720 (600 +20%) candelas 6.5 Single lamp containing more than one light source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">(1) Lamp shall comply with the minimum intensity requirement when one light source has failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">(2) When all light sources are illuminated the maximum intensities shall not be exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">-20% 
 +20% 
 In the present case, the Corporate Respondents sold Condor Products marked with the Captions relying upon the oral assurance of the manufacturer as to their performance characteristics and without first having obtained a test report and then a CRN for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">(The Corporate Respondents did eventually obtain written test reports but only after they had begun making the Representations - that is, after they had begun supplying products marked with the Captions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">) It is this conduct which LED Tech asserts is in breach of ss 52, 53(a), 53(c) and 65C of the TPA and which lies at the heart of the issues to be addressed in this section of the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">Legislation and Relevant Principles
 Section 52 of the TPA relevantly provides that: 
A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The relevant legal principles are well known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">A two-step analysis is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">First, it is necessary to ask whether each or any of the pleaded representations is conveyed by the particular events complained of: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [105] ; National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] ATPR 42-000 at [18] per Dowsett J (with whom Jacobson and Bennett JJ agreed) and Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 22 ; [2006] ATPR 42-106 at [37] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Secondly, it is necessary to ask whether the representations conveyed are false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">This is a "quintessential question of fact": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Telstra [2004] FCA 987 ; (2004) 208 ALR 459 at [49] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Because the conduct complained of in the present matter was not directed at a specific individual, both questions that have been identified must be considered by reference to the class or classes of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct: Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 , 199 per Gibbs CJ; Nike at [102], [103], [105] and [106]; Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at [36] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">In .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 424 ; (2004) 207 ALR 521 at [12] - [26] , Finkelstein J provided a useful summary of the approach that might be taken where a court is required to assess conduct by reference to a specific class or classes of consumers and did that by particular reference to Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 , 202-203 per Deane and Fitzgerald JJ and Nike at [100]-[103].</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The approach may be summarised in six points, as follows: The question in this case can therefore be stated as being whether an ordinary or reasonable member of each identified class would perceive the Captions as conveying one or both of the Representations?</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">If yes, the next question is whether the representations are false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of each identified class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">LED Tech also alleges that the conduct complained of contravenes ss 53(a) and (c) of the TPA, which provide: 
A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connexion with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connexion with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services:
 
...
 
 
(a) falsely represent that goods are of a particular standard, quality, value, grade, composition, style or model ...;
 
...
 
 
(c) represent that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits they do not have ...
 
 Section 53 identifies specific types of conduct which, if engaged in by a corporation in connection with the promotion or supply of goods and services, will contravene ss 52 and 53 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">However, unlike s 52, breach of s 53 is an offence: Pt VC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">If the conduct complained of by LED Tech contravened s 52 of the TPA, then having regard to its content, that conduct would also contravene ss 53(a) and (c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Finally, LED Tech also alleges that the conduct complained of contravenes s 65C(1) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Section 65C(1) provides that "a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, supply goods that are intended to be used, or are of the kind likely to be used, by a consumer if the goods are of a kind (a) in respect of which there is a prescribed consumer product safety standard and which do not comply with that standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">" The Trade Practices (Consumer Product Safety Standards) Regulations 1979 (Cth) prescribe relevant consumer product safety standards: s 65C(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Analysis
 As noted earlier, a two-step analysis is to be undertaken in considering the application of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">First, is each or any of the Representations conveyed by one or more of the Captions?</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">If so, are the Representations false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of each identified class?</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Before turning to the Representations, it is necessary to understand that two classes of consumers are pleaded: the public and / or consumers of automotive lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">As noted above, the targeted section or sections of the public will vary according to the facts of each case: see [146(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The parties failed to address the question of the relevant class or classes and the effect (if any) of such distinctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">However, the evidence disclosed that consumers of automotive lamps fell into two general classes --- the manufacturers of vehicles or trailers and the aftermarket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">The aftermarket comprises those consumers who purchase tail lights to replace one which has broken or to add another tail light to the existing tail lights on a vehicle or trailer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Many of the aftermarket sales occur through automotive retailers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">The division is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">It is important because the Captions convey a different representation to the manufacturers of vehicles and trailers than they do to the aftermarket consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">What representations then are conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">What conveyed to manufacturers of vehicles and trailers?</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Dealing first with manufacturers of vehicles and trailers, each of the Condor Products bore the Captions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">What do those words convey?</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Compliance with a standard?</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">Tested to a standard?</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">Approved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Those who work in the industry know (or think they know - as we have seen, what the rules and regulations actually require is another matter) that the process is one in which a product is tested by a testing laboratory for particular performance characteristics against criteria set out in an ADR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">The laboratory's report is provided to DOTARS together with an application for a CRN and then DOTARS allocates a unique CRN number to the product in relation to the particular ADR against which it was tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">On any view, the Representations (or some combination of them) are conveyed by the Captions to those in the industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">What conveyed to aftermarket?</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">What do the words convey to those who do not work in the industry?</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">They do not know the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">All they know is that the product bears Captions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The Captions represent, at the very least, that the lamps comply with some kind of governmental safety standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The phrase connotes approval by an authorised (ie government or government-approved) body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Representations false, misleading or deceptive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">The next question is whether the Representations were false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of each identified class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">As noted earlier, the Condor Products were sold bearing the Captions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Moreover, the Captions conveyed a different representation to each identified class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Manufacturers of vehicles and trailers
 Both the phrase "ADR Approved" and "Complies with ADR" were false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of the identified class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">As noted earlier, those who work in the industry understand that the process is one in which a product is tested by a testing laboratory for particular performance characteristics against criteria set out in an ADR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">The laboratory's report is provided to DOTARS together with an application for a CRN and then DOTARS allocates a unique CRN number to the product in relation to the particular ADR against which it was tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">In the present case, at the relevant time none of the Corporate Respondents had obtained a CRN let alone a test result from a certified laboratory that provided any basis for making such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">That the entire industry may be operating under a misconception as to the actual procedural and substantive requirements for ADR compliance does not change the fact that an ordinary member of the class would be misled by the Representations in that they would think that the product in question had been tested and administratively "approved" (the quotation marks being necessary to acknowledge that the approval in question was not necessarily legally cognisable) when in fact it had not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">Aftermarket
 There was no basis for asserting that the lamp was "ADR Approved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">It was not "approved" by anybody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">Neither the ADRs nor Circular 0-4-26 prescribe an "approval process".</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">DOTARS certainly does not "approve" anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Moreover, I reject the submission of the Corporate Respondents that a CRN was unnecessary and it was merely sufficient for them to obtain a report from a testing laboratory before labelling the goods "ADR Approved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">The testing laboratory does not "approve" anything either.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">It merely tests lamps given to it and produces a report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The phrase "ADR Approved" was false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of the identified class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The other Caption was the phrase "Complies with ADR".</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">To those who do not work in the industry, the phrase conveys at the very least the message that the product has been properly tested (and by properly I mean that an ordinary consumer would not think that an oral or unsupported assurance was sufficient to justify the representation) and has met the standard prescribed by the relevant ADR (and here again the difficulties in identifying the actual procedural and substantive content of ADR compliance are of course irrelevant - the ordinary consumer would neither know nor care; the point is only that they would think the product had been tested by a reputable body and found "up to snuff").</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">In the present case, the phrase "Complies with ADR" was false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of the identified class until at least August or September 2007 because none of the Corporate Respondents had obtained written test results from a certified laboratory that provided any basis for making such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">Other TPA claims
 The Representations also breached ss 53(a) and 53(c) of the TPA for the same reasons that the Representations breached s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">However, there is no violation of s 65C of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">As noted earlier s 65C1(a) prohibits the supply of goods which do not comply with a prescribed safety standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">In contrast to ss 52 and 53, s 65C does not ask whether a consumer is likely to be misled, nor does it ask what a consumer might understand about a certain product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">To put it even more bluntly, s 65C is not concerned with representations at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">It simply poses an objective question: has a product been supplied for consumer use which does not comply with a prescribed safety standard?</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">To prove a case under this provision, a party must: (1) identify a product; (2) identify the time of supply of that product; (3) identify the relevant safety standard in force at the time; and (4) lead evidence showing that the particular product did not meet the standard: see ACCC v Hercules Iron Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1182 at [10] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">LED Tech, in approaching its case on a misleading and deceptive conduct basis only, failed to establish the elements of its s 65C case in a satisfactory manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">While it led evidence of safety tests and the supply of lamps, it failed to connect particular lamps, having been supplied at particular times, to particular tests demonstrating non-compliance of those lamps with the ADRs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">The last bit would in any event have been tricky, if not impossible, because the ADRs, due to the peculiar amendments that have been made to the UNECE Regulation and the uncertain status of the Circulars, do not really prescribe much of a standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">Not only is a 20% variance in luminosity allowed, there is no procedure (notwithstanding any industry practice or understanding to the contrary) as to how compliance with the standard is to be assessed and proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Based on the evidence, it appears that the tests relied on by LED Tech to establish the non-compliance of the Condor Products may have applied stricter procedural and substantive criteria than those actually imposed by the applicable rules and regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Therefore, I cannot be satisfied on the balance of the probabilities that the Corporate Respondents did in fact supply products that did not comply with the ADRs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">No damage
 Notwithstanding that one or more of the Representations conveyed was false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, LED Tech's claims under the TPA fail because LED Tech did not establish an essential element of the cause of action --- damage: Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 , 525 (per Mason CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Although never properly articulated, the causation and damages theory of LED Tech's TPA claims seemed to be a lost sales theory similar to that underpinning the infringement claim: (1) (a) consumers prefer to buy, or (b) in some cases will only buy; (2) products that are marked as complying with applicable safety standards and that do comply with those standards; (3) LED Tech's lamps comply with the ADRs; (4) had it been known to the market that the Corporate Respondents' products did not comply with the ADRs (ie if they did not bear the Captions); (5) all those who purchased the Corporate Respondents' products; (6) would instead have purchased LED Tech's lamps; (7) such that the Representations caused LED Tech to lose sales in the amount of the Corporate Respondents' sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">As noted earlier, LED Tech's claim seemed to assume that every sale made by the Corporate Respondents of a Condor Product would have been a sale that LED Tech would have made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">That is not an assumption that can be made in the infringement context, and it is even more remote in the TPA context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">It is not supported by human experience or, more importantly, by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">As I noted at the outset, the market in Australia for LED automotive lamps was highly competitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">There was evidence that certain large manufacturers would only buy from suppliers holding CRNs; however, there was no evidence to show that ordinary consumers, particularly aftermarket consumers, considered safety compliance to be so material as to prevail over factors such as price and convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">Furthermore, it goes without saying that LED Tech's lost sales, whatever the precise number of units, cannot be double counted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">In no event could they be more than the number of units actually sold by the Corporate Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">As noted earlier, I calculated infringement damages based on the assumption that the Respondents' sales data reflected the number of units actually sold by them, less a certain (not precisely quantifiable) discount based on the fact that their data was on the conservative side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">To receive any damages under the TPA over and above the infringement award, LED Tech would have to satisfy the Court that the TPA contraventions caused it to lose additional sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">On the evidence before me, LED Tech has not done that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">First, I re-emphasise the absence of any evidence as to the materiality of safety compliance representations to the average consumer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Second, the infringement lost sales claim will, by its nature, tend to encompass a greater sum than a TPA claim on the same basis because by hypothesis the infringing product would not have been in the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">That is to say, had the Corporate Respondents not infringed the Designs, they would not have produced the Condor Products and LED Tech would have had one less competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">On the other hand, in the hypothetical world in which the Corporate Respondents did not breach ss 52 and 53 of the TPA, their Condor Products could still have been on the shelves alongside LED Tech's lamps; the only difference would have been that they would not have borne the Captions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">It is difficult to see how LED Tech could lose more sales in a notional world where the Corporate Respondents were still allowed to sell their products (albeit without "ADR Approved" and "Complies with ADR" endorsements) than in a world where the Condor Products did not exist at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">For those reasons, I am not satisfied that LED Tech established any additional loss arising from any one or more of the TPA contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Accordingly, I would not grant LED Tech any relief in relation to these claims in addition to that identified above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">I.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">DIRECTORS' LIABILITY?</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">
 Introduction
 As noted earlier, LED Tech also contends that the Sixth Respondent ("Mr Keller") and the Seventh Respondent ("Mr Armstrong") ("the Directors") authorised, directed and further or alternatively procured the conduct of the Third and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">During the course of the hearing, LED Tech stated that it no longer seeks relief against the Fifth Respondent, Mr Morrison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">In relation to the Directors, that conduct is said to include: that the Directors have acted in concert with Ren and Olsen in respect of its infringement of the Designs or wrongfully procured and or induced Ren and Olsen to infringe the Designs; and that under ss 75B, 80 and 82(1) of the TPA, each of the Directors was a person who aided and / or abetted and or was directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to the contravention by each of Ren and Olsen of ss 52, 53(a), 53(c) and 65C of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">At the time of the "relevant events", Mr Keller and Mr Armstrong were directors of Ren and Olsen with Mr Armstrong acting also as Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Mr Keller's evidence was that he, together with Mr Armstrong, "is the boss" of Ren and Olsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">In relation to Version 1 lamps, the "relevant events" included, but were not limited to, the conception and design of the infringing Condor lights at a time when at least Mr Keller was aware of the existence of the Designs, discussions with manufacturers about the manufacture of the those lights and the subsequent importation and sale of them in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">In addition, Mr Keller designed and conceived the Version 2 and 3 lights and arranged for their manufacture and importation into Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Moreover, Mr Armstrong was the nominated signatory for all applications for CRNs and the addressee for all correspondence from DOTARS relating to CRNs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">In addition, he was involved in photometric testing of Condor LED lights and knew what Mr Keller was doing in relation to the Condor Products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">In determining whether this level of conduct and knowledge establishes liability, each cause of action needs to be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">Joint tortfeasors to the design infringement?</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">In relation to the infringement of the Designs, LED Tech alleges that the Directors are joint tortfeasors to the design infringement as each had "a common design" with Ren and Olsen to infringe the Designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">As submitted by counsel for the Directors, the test to be applied is far from certain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">One line of cases adopts what is known as the "direct or procure" test ( Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd [1924] 1 KB 1 , 14-15, while the other line of cases adopts the test in Mentmore Manufacturing v National Merchandising Manufacturing (1978) 89 DLR (3d) 195 that a director is only personally liable if it is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the director was not the direction of the manufacturing and selling activity of the company in the course of his relationship to it but the "deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it": at 204-205.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">In Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum &amp; Co Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1838 ; (2001) 53 IPR 400 at [39] , a design infringement case, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the two tests in the following terms: 
The authorities were collected and analysed by Beazley J in King v Milpurrurru (1996) 66 FCR 474 at 494-500..... Her Honour noted the existence of two lines of authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">One line supported what she called the "Performing Right Society test " : whether the director had "directed or procured" the company's infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">The other line supported "the Mentmore test": whether the director had engaged in "the deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">Beazley J expressed a preference for the Mentmore test, on the basis that the Performing Right Society test did not "pay sufficient regard, either to the separate legal existence of the company, or to the fact that the company acts through its directors": see [66 FCR at 500].</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">However, this preference had no immediate consequence; her Honour held (again at [500]) that the appellants were not liable under either test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">After listing a number of cases (at [40]-[41]) supporting each approach and considering the submissions of the parties, the Full Court went on to say (at [43]-[44]): 
The difference between the two tests may be more apparent than real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that a director or officer of a company directed or procured the company's infringing act, yet that person escaped liability because he or she did not deliberately, wilfully or knowingly pursue a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or that reflected indifference to the risk of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">This may be because, in practice, an act of direction or procurement will generally meet the Mentmore test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">It is notable that, in Mentmore itself, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal declined (at 204) to "go so far as to hold that the director or officer must know or have reason to know that the acts which he directs or procures constitute infringement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">The Court declined to do this because that "would be to impose a condition of liability that does not exist for patent infringement generally".</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">To the extent there is a real difference between the tests, each has eloquent supporters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">One day it may be necessary, in a practical sense, to choose between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">But it is not necessary to do so in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">The position here is the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">This is not a case in which Messrs Keller and Armstrong acted only as directors of the infringing companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Each had personal knowledge of the Designs and of the other facts and matters set out above (see [169]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">To adopt the language of the Full Court, it was clear that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong "was personally an actor invading [LED Tech's] rights: by creating the [Condor Products]" and taking the other steps outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">These sequences of actions were "the deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct" that was likely to constitute infringement or, at least, reflected a conscious indifference to the risk of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">As a result, each of the Directors also engaged in the design infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Each is a joint tortfeasor to the design infringement as each had "a common design" with Ren and Olsen to infringe the Designs and is jointly and severally liable to LED Tech for the damages assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">Secondary liability under the TPA
 The next matter to be considered is the claim of secondary liability of the Directors under the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">The principles are well established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">Natural persons will be liable in damages for a contravention by a corporation if they had a "close, rather than a remote involvement in the contravention": Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 , 584.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">Moreover, the participation in the contravention requires actual, rather than constructive, knowledge of the essential matters that make up the contravention: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 , 666-670 and 677, Rural Press Ltd v ACCC [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [67] and Quinlivan v ACCC (2004) 160 FCR 1 at [8]-[9].</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Did Messrs Keller and Armstrong had actual rather than constructive knowledge of the "essential matters" that make up the contraventions under the TPA?</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">As noted earlier, two contraventions were pleaded; namely that the Directors "aided and / or abetted and / or were directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to" (1) the alleged mislabelling of the Condor Products as to compliance with the ADRs (in contravention of ss 52, 53(a) and (c) of the TPA) and (2) the alleged contraventions of ADRs 1, 6 and 49 as "prescribed consumer product safety standards" (in contravention of s 65C of the TPA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">The former was made out, but the latter was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">However, as explained earlier in these reasons for decision (see [162]-[166]), notwithstanding that one or more of the Representations was false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive within the meaning of ss 52 and 53, LED Tech's claims failed because LED Tech did not establish an essential element of the cause of action --- damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">As a result, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Directors "aided and / or abetted and / or were directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to" the contravention by the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">However, if LED Tech had established damage, I do not consider that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew of the "essential matters" that enabled the representations to be characterised in the manner contended: ACCC v Kaye [2004] FCA 1363 at [182] - [186] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">To adopt the language of the majority of the Full Court in Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at [12-16] , although I accept that each of Messrs Keller and Armstrong knew (1) that the Condor Products were manufactured, sold and packaged and (2) the content of the manner in which they were sold which might lead members of at least one class of consumer to believe that the products complied with "prescribed consumer product safety standards", I do not conclude that either Messrs Keller or Armstrong knew the facts that meant that the Representations were not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">As to the "ADR Approved" representation, they gave evidence as to their subjective understanding of the representation conveyed, which, while possibly negligent or even reckless, was not such as to suggest wilful blindness or actual knowledge of how a relevant purchaser might understand it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">As to the "Complies with ADR" representation, their evidence (which I accept) was that they relied upon oral and written assurances from their Chinese manufacturer and testing laboratories which turned out to be belatedly or never substantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">Was that conduct less than wise?</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">Was it negligent and possibly even reckless?</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">- Again, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">But on the current state of the authorities that is not sufficient to establish the actual knowledge necessary to establish accessorial liability under the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">Significantly, it was never put to either Mr Keller or Mr Armstrong during the course of cross-examination that they knew these "essential matters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">Accordingly, even if LED Tech had established that the TPA contraventions had caused it damage, they could not establish the secondary liability of the Directors for those contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">ADDITIONAL CROSS-CLAIMS AGAINST LED TECH AND MR OTTOBRE 
 By way of cross-claim, the cross-claimants contend that LED Tech and Mr Ottobre engaged in conduct which constitutes unjustified threats of design infringement and, separately, other conduct which breaches s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Unjustified threats of design infringement
 There were two allegations of unjustified threats of design infringement under ss 77 and 79 of the 2003 Designs Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">The first concerned a document circulated by LED Tech on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">The second related to a letter sent by LED Tech's solicitors to Ren and Olsen dated 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">Neither of these documents supports such an allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">First and foremost, I found that the Designs were properly registered and the claim of infringement is made out, so it could not be said that allegations of infringement were unjustified even if they were deemed threats: Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd v IceTV Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 99 at [232] (suggesting that where there is actual infringement a threat will not be unjustified).</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Secondly, the 5 February 2007 document did not, in its terms, contain any threat of proceedings for design infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">The document contained 6 paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">The first five related to the ADRs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">The last paragraph stated: 
Since the lamps are similar in appearance to LED Technologies' lamps, we are currently consulting our legal advisers regarding litigation against vendors of these lamps in order to protect our reputation and to protect consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">Taken at its highest, it states that LED Tech was seeking legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">It makes no threat of proceedings for design infringement: but cf Occupational and Medical Innovations Limited v Retractable Technologies Inc (2007) 73 IPR 312 (concluding that a similar letter constituted a threat under s 128 of the Patent Act 1990 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Thirdly, the second event, the 7 September 2007 letters, contained a threat of legal proceedings at a time when the current proceedings had already been on foot for some 5 months against Elecspess and AAA in respect of infringement of the Designs: see Elwood Clothing Pty Ltd v Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd (2008) 76 IPR 83 at [41] and authorities there cited (stating that threats made after proceedings have already been instituted or that result in the bringing of proceedings are less likely to be deemed unjustified).</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">For those reasons, the cross-claimants' claim of unjustified threats of design infringement is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">TPA claims
 The cross-claimants also claim that LED Tech and Mr Ottobre engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">The conduct said to breach s 52 of the TPA comprised three separate events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">LED Tech's website
 The first concerned the contents of LED Tech's website from 25 July 2007 until 7 January 2008 insofar as that website contained the following statements under the heading "Beware of Inferior Copy's (sic) from China" ("Website representation"): 
Below is a list of company's (sic) with Questionable Practices, these company's (sic) are either Notorious for Ripping off Original Designs, Ripping off Trademark Names, Stamping ADR ... on Lenses when they are not, and selling Inferior, Low Quality, Low Grade copied products that fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">The below companies do not have our specially formulated resin and their resin sealing method will crack away from the lenses with temperature changes and vibration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">The below companies may claim they have this method, but can you trust them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">1/ China Trailer Industry http://www.china-trailers.com , manufacturers of Condor brand lamps which are inferior copies of our product, leaking lenses, low grade LEDs, product recalled in Australia because they don't meet the necessary standards, lenses stamped ADR approved when they are not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">We have instituted copyright proceedings (sic) against Australian importers and resellers in the federal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">To view Recall go to http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemld/790664 
 
 
...
 The notice was removed from LED Tech's website on the advice of its solicitor and some months after being told that the Corporate Respondents considered the statements in the notice to be false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">At the time that the notice was placed on LED Tech's website, only Version 1 Condor Products had been sold by Ren and Elecspess in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">Version 3 Condor Products were not sold until after the notice had been taken down from LED Tech's website in January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">On any view, portions of the notice were false at one time or another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">At no time were copyright proceedings instituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">Moreover, LED Tech knew no later than 7 August 2007 that China Trailer was not the manufacturer of Condor Products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">In the end, however, the conduct does not give rise to any relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">None of the cross-claimants did or could establish loss or damage resulting from the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">In fact, assuming that the website caused them to lose sales on the infringing Condor Products, then it saved the cross-claimants money in that it reduced the number of their sales (and thus LED Tech's corresponding lost sales) based on which infringement damages were awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">The claim should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">August 2007 letter
 The second event concerned a circular letter distributed in August 2007 entitled "ELECSPESS TO RECALL CONDOR LED LAMPS" ("the Letter Representation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">The Circular was in the following form: 
Dear Consumer,
 
 
Please be aware that ADR compliance is very difficult to attain by inferior quality lamps, some manufacturers have resorted to stamping the lens as ADR compliant when in actual fact they are not!</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">With the popularity of LED lamps the market has become inundated with cheap inferior copies of many different original designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">This is extremely disappointing for the original designers and we hope that you support us by not purchasing copied products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The contents of the notice below has been published by the ACCC on its website: www.accc.gov.au
 
 The ACCC notice recorded, as was the fact, that its investigation into alleged non-compliance with the ADR for automotive lights had resulted in Elecspess providing a court-enforceable undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">The notice went on to state: 
Elecspess had represented that its range of CONDOR LED Rear Combination Lamps complied with certain [ADRs].</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">Independent testing showed that these lamps failed to meet the light requirements of the design rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">The ACCC considered that by representing that the lamps complied with the rules when they did not, Elecspess falsely represented to consumers that these lamps were of a particular standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">Elecspess also represented that the lamps had performance characteristics that they did not have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Further the ACCC considered that Elecspess had supplied goods not compliant with prescribed consumer product safety standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">Elecspess responded promptly to the ACCC's concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">It has given the ACCC a s 87B court-enforceable undertaking that it will:-
 
 Complete a total recall of non compliant lamps sold by Elecspess by contacting each affected customer to explain the nature of the contraventions and offer to exchange the non-compliant lamps, and implement a trade practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">
 Not supply products that are subject to consumer product safety standard, unless the products comply with the relevant standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">
 Quarantine all non compliant lamps and have them shipped back to the manufacturer in China where the manufacturer will make the necessary changes to these lamps to ensure compliance with the rules ....
 The ACCC notice was drafted by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">It was factual both historically and in relation to the arrangements existing at the time the notice was issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">Consistent with ACCC practice, the notice was and remains on the ACCC's website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">The circular was sent to 5,000 automotive part resellers, electricians and truck and trailer manufacturers in Australia in August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">At that time, the Corporate Respondents had only sold Version 1 Condor Products in Australia and had not completed the recall of those products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">There is perhaps an interesting question whether the further dissemination or adoption of a factually true statement made by another would in these circumstances constitute misleading or deceptive conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">However, whether the contents of the Circular were false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive can be put to one side because, again, none of the cross-claimants did or could establish loss or damage resulting from the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">The claim should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">LED Tech's packaging
 The third event concerned the contents of LED Tech's own packaging from at least December 2005 until November 2007 ("the Packaging Representation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">The complaint relates to the statement on the rear of packaging that: 
 "We only use polycarbonate thermoplastic which has an extremely high impact tolerance" 
 
 The evidence disclosed that when LED Tech changed manufacturer from Valens to "M", the composition of the lamps changed from polycarbonate to acrylic, but LED Tech forgot to change its packaging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">The change to acrylic occurred in about January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">Some of the packaging still contained the Packaging Representation in July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">There is no doubt that from January 2006 (at the latest) LED Tech's products were made of acrylic and not polycarbonate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">As noted earlier, a two-step analysis is to be undertaken in considering the application of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">First, is the representation conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">If so, is the representation false, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive an ordinary or reasonable member of each identified class?</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">There are two hurdles to the claims made by Ren, Olsen and Elecspess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">First, the class was not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">I suspect, but do not know, that if the classes are those identified earlier (ie manufacturers and aftermarket purchasers), the question posed in relation to each of those classes might produce a different result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">In other words, an ordinary or reasonable member of those who work in the industry might be different to a consumer who buys the product in the aftermarket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">The former might be interested in the composition of the lamp's lens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">The latter I suspect would not be --- his or her interest is likely to be price and possibly how the product looks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">As Mr Ransom said in evidence, although polycarbonate was very fashionable many years ago, it has never been a factor in a customer's decision to purchase lamps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">This last point brings up the second hurdle faced by Ren, Olsen and Elecspess, which is that they did not and cannot establish that they suffered any loss as a result of the Packaging Representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">Not only did the evidence show that lens composition is not a significant factor in a customer's purchase decision at all (ie no causation generally), there is no evidence to show that an accurate representation would have caused consumers to purchase Condor Products as opposed to some other polycarbonate lens (ie no causation specifically).</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">Furthermore, even assuming that Ren, Olsen and Elecspess had established lost or depressed sales in the period from 2006 to 2008 (which would be difficult, if not impossible, given that the Condor lamps were brought to market well after the January 2006 LED Tech change in lens composition so that there was never a period to which a sales comparison could be made when the Condor lamps were on the market without the Packaging Representation being made), the evidence disclosed numerous other causes for the fact that the sales of Condor Products were likely to be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">It is unnecessary to address each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">It is sufficient for present purposes to record that the Condor brand was damaged by the ACCC recall, a recall that was consented to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">This second hurdle provides another separate and independent reason why this aspect of the cross-claim fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">K. ORDERS 
 I do not propose to make final orders today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">I will instead order the parties to confer and jointly file short minutes of final orders giving effect to these reasons for decision, including orders as to the further conduct of this matter, by 4.00pm on 23 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">If the parties are unable to agree, they are to submit a joint statement by 4.00pm on 23 January 2009 identifying: (1) the point(s) of agreement; (2) the point(s) of disagreement; and (3) the respective positions of the parties on the point(s) of disagreement, in which case I will list the matter for further directions or argument as necessary.</sentence>
