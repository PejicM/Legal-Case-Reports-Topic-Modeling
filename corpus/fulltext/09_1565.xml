<sentence id="s0">
 In this application, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the "Authority") seeks declarations as to contraventions by the respondent, Mr Atkinson, of s 16(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (the " Spam Act "), injunctions restraining Mr Atkinson from engaging in contravening conduct in the future and an order for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty in respect of the contended contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application was listed for final hearing and determination on the footing that the parties have reached agreement as to the facts giving rise to contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act and, subject to discretionary considerations, the parties are agreed as to the formulation of the proposed declarations and injunctions to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In addition, the parties have reached agreement as to the pecuniary penalty they jointly submit the Court ought to order having regard to all of the statutory considerations going to that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Those matters are supported by extensive written joint submissions filed by the parties and supplementary written submissions in relation to additional matters to be mentioned later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr Atkinson admits the contraventions alleged against him, based on the agreed facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The joint submissions go beyond simply questions of fact and extend to joint submissions as to matters relevant to the exercise of the power to impose a pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The agreed facts, extracted from the joint written submissions, are these: 
 
 Facts 
 

 The material facts relied on and the details of the conduct the subject of the proceedings are set out in the statement of claim and below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, Mr Atkinson operated a business, under the name "Sancash", which promoted various herbal products, adult products, and replica watches (the Sancash products ), by means of unsolicited email messages (the spam emails ) sent by a series of approximately 45 recruited individuals (the Sancash affiliates ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">If a recipient purchased a Sancash product as a result of the spam emails sent by a Sancash affiliate, Mr Atkinson received a commission payment from the supplier of the product, and in turn paid a commission to the Sancash affiliate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A spam email sent by a Sancash affiliate would contain an internet link through which the recipient of the spam email could order a promoted product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Sancash affiliates were allocated their own specific internet links to include in the spam emails that they sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">This enabled a Sancash affiliate to be identified in relation to a particular purchase and for a commission to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The operation of the Sancash business between October 2006 and December 2007 involved the sending of millions of spam emails worldwide by Sancash affiliates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Atkinson did not personally send the spam emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Atkinson caused the emails to be sent as he: 
 
 
 12.1 managed and operated the Sancash business, including recruiting Sancash affiliates, communicating with them electronically, monitoring their sales, paying commissions to them, and providing customer support services for orders generated by the Sancash affiliates, including responding to customer queries; 
 

 
 
 12.2 established and provided, or caused to be established and provided, to the Sancash affiliates internet domain names (including causing to be established and provided the domain names in Attachment 1 to these submissions) and website templates through which they were able to direct sales in the spam emails; and 
 

 
 
 12.3 created and provided, or caused to be created and provided, particular subject lines for use in the spam emails, to assist in avoiding automatic spam filters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Subject lines that Mr Atkinson caused to be created and provided, by a subordinate, include the subject lines in Attachment 2 to these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 

 The spam emails were sent for the purpose of offering to supply, or promoting, the Sancash products, and were accordingly commercial electronic messages within the meaning of that expression in s.6 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The spam emails did not fall within the exception in s.16(1)(b) of the Spam Act for "designated commercial messages", as defined in Schedule 1 of the Spam Act , as they contained content other than factual information, being a promotional message in relation to the Sancash products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The spam emails were sent to persons including recipients in Australia, and included messages accessed using computers, servers or devices located in Australia, and messages sent to electronic account-holders who were individuals physically present in Australia when the emails were accessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Such emails had an Australian link within the meaning of that expression in s.7 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This proceeding is confined to the conduct of Mr Atkinson in causing to be sent those spam emails which had an Australian link (the Australian spam emails ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Atkinson says that he requested some new affiliates not to send the email messages to some Australian email addresses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Atkinson did not retain any records of such communications and the records produced by him or otherwise obtained by the ACMA do not contain any of these statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The precise terms of Mr Atkinson's requests accordingly cannot be specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Atkinson admits that he gave no instruction or direction that would be capable of ensuring no Australian address received the spam emails and he in fact observed that orders were received from Australian customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Atkinson also did not take effective steps to check whether such instructions as may have been given about Australian addresses were complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He also suspected, but did not check, that at least one of the affiliates was based in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Attachment 3 to these submissions is a CD of emails identified by the applicant as Australian spam emails sent by the Sancash affiliates, and caused to be sent by Mr Atkinson, during the period between 18 October 2007 and 17 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The emails are extracted from a database maintained by the applicant, referred to as the "SpamMatters database", through which members of the public in Australia are able to report, and forward to the ACMA, unsolicited commercial emails received at their email accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The extracted emails contained in Attachment 3 comprise those from the ACMA's SpamMatters database which incorporated one of the domain names identified at Attachment 1 as created by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">There are 140,789 emails extracted in the attached disk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">They consist of the following numbers of emails sent on each day listed below: 
 Date Number of Emails Date Number of Emails 18 October 2007 3045 18 November 2007 1899 19 October 2007 4156 19 November 2007 2522 20 October 2007 2815 20 November 2007 2721 21 October 2007 1406 21 November 2007 2069 22 October 2007 3748 22 November 2007 2135 23 October 2007 2744 23 November 2007 2398 24 October 2007 2732 24 November 2007 2444 25 October 2007 2830 25 November 2007 2471 26 October 2007 2785 26 November 2007 2659 27 October 2007 2679 27 November 2007 2056 28 October 2007 2093 28 November 2007 2525 29 October 2007 2294 29 November 2007 3164 30 October 2007 3929 30 November 2007 2605 31 October 2007 2718 1 December 2007 2479 1 November 2007 1744 2 December 2007 2124 2 November 2007 2460 3 December 2007 2724 3 November 2007 1858 4 December 2007 4628 4 November 2007 3247 5 December 2007 3083 5 November 2007 2562 6 December 2007 2231 6 November 2007 2058 7 December 2007 2028 7 November 2007 1429 8 December 2007 1594 8 November 2007 1076 9 December 2007 1381 9 November 2007 971 10 December 2007 1522 10 November 2007 616 11 December 2007 1368 11 November 2007 1550 12 December 2007 1274 12 November 2007 1696 13 December 2007 3056 13 November 2007 2225 14 December 2007 2887 14 November 2007 2192 15 December 2007 1354 15 November 2007 2673 16 December 2007 872 16 November 2007 2699 17 December 2007 911 17 November 2007 2575 
 
 
 
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As these constitute only the emails which both: 
 

 
 
 20.1 were formally reported to the applicant by members of the public in Australia; and 
 

 
 
 20.2 fall within the limitations described at paragraph 18 above; 
 

 
 
 the ACMA submits, and Mr Atkinson accepts, that these emails are likely to represent only a small proportion of the total number of Australian spam emails with an Australian link actually sent by the Sancash affiliates, and which Mr Atkinson caused to be sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 

 On or about 17 December 2007, premises of an associate of Mr Atkinson who was apparently involved in the Sancash operations, Mr Roland Smits, were subject to searches by regulatory authorities in New Zealand and computer equipment was seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The pleaded conduct occurred up to the time of that intervention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The ACMA alleges, and Mr Atkinson admits, that by engaging in the conduct pleaded in the statement of claim, between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, he caused to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages, which had an Australian link, in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It can be seen from the agreed facts that between 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007 Mr Atkinson operated a business called "Sancash" which promoted the sale of herbal products, adult products and replica watches by means of unsolicited email messages sent by approximately 45 recruited individuals who were paid a commission by Mr Atkinson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The joint submission also adopts the statement of claim in the proceeding filed on 21 October 2009 that describes the products as herbal products promoted or supplied by Genbucks Limited, adult sex toys supplied or promoted by Genbucks Limited and watches branded "King Replica".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The spam emails sent by Sancash affiliates contained an internet link to a website from which a product could be purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The operation of the Sancash business between the relevant dates involved the sending of millions of spam emails worldwide by Sancash affiliates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Mr Atkinson caused the emails to be sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As the emails were sent for the purpose of offering to supply or promote Sancash products, they were "commercial electronic messages" within the meaning of that term in s 6 of the Spam Act and they did not fall within the exception in s 16(1)(b) of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The spam emails were sent to recipients in Australia using computers, servers or devices located in Australia and thus the conduct of Mr Atkinson had, at all relevant times, what is described as an "Australian link" for the purposes of s 7 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The period of the contravening conduct was almost 14 months in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">As the agreed facts make clear, millions of spam emails were sent by Sancash affiliates "worldwide" although these proceedings are confined to the conduct of Mr Atkinson in causing unsolicited commercial electronic messages to be sent which had an Australian link.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The parties agree that over a period of 61 days, 140,789 emails that were caused to be sent by Mr Atkinson were formally reported to the Authority by members of the public in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The emails incorporated as points of supply one of the many domain names identified at Attachment 1 to the joint submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Attachment 1 consists of a 10-page document comprising five columns of domain names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There are approximately 2,090 domain names recited in Attachment 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr Atkinson accepts that the 140,789 emails are likely to represent only a small proportion of the total number of Australian spam emails with an Australian link actually sent by the Sancash affiliates and which Mr Atkinson caused to be sent (para 20 of the agreed submissions).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">At para 12.3 of the agreed submissions, Mr Atkinson accepts that an element of causing the emails to be sent involved his conduct in causing to be created and provided, particular subject lines called "ManSter/VPXL Subject Lines", for use in spam emails so as to attempt to prevent automatic spam filters detecting and deflecting unsolicited commercial electronic messages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Accordingly, it is common ground that all of the integers of s 16 are made out and Mr Atkinson has sent or caused to be sent a commercial electronic message that has an Australian link and is not a designated commercial electronic message for the purposes of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Section 24 of the Spam Act is in these terms: 
 
 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Pecuniary penalties for contravention of civil penalty provisions 
 

 
 
 (1) If the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in respect of each contravention, as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 

 
 
 (2) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including: 
 

 
 
 (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and 
 

 
 
 (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and 
 

 
 
 (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; 
 

 
 
 (d) whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct; and 
 

 
 
 (e) if the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so --- whether the person has previously been found by a court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

 The maximum penalties for contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act are set out in s 25 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">For a person who is an individual and who has not been previously found to have contravened the Spam Act , the maximum penalty prescribed by s 25(4) is 20 penalty units in respect of a contravention of s 16(1) ; or if the Federal Court finds that the person has, on a particular day, committed two or more contraventions of s 16(1) , the total penalties payable under s 24(1) by the person in respect of those contraventions must not exceed 400 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A penalty unit is defined in s 4 of the Spam Act as having the meaning given by s 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides that a penalty unit is $110.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Accordingly, the maximum applicable penalty for each of the 61 days on which more than one contravention is admitted and found by the Court to have occurred, is $44,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The maximum penalty in respect of the contraventions admitted over the 61 days set out in the schedule at para 19 of the joint submission quoted at [5], is $2,684,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">By para 35 of the joint submission, the parties contend that on the basis of the principles, factors and circumstances set out in the submission, it is appropriate that the Court impose upon Mr Atkinson in respect of the contraventions across the period of the 61 days, a single pecuniary penalty in an amount of $210,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This represents a pecuniary penalty of 7.82% of the maximum penalty prescribed by s 25 of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As to the five criteria identified in s 24 of the Spam Act , the parties jointly make these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">First, the Sancash spamming activity caused by Mr Atkinson was " deliberate , extensive , and occurred over a lengthy period" [emphasis added].</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The parties agree that in view of the admissions made by Mr Atkinson as to the conduct, the authority does not seek to adduce evidence as to the likely numbers of spam emails with an Australian link that Mr Atkinson caused to be sent over the full period of the contraventions, namely, 14 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">At para 46, the parties jointly say: 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">However, the parties jointly submit that it is a relevant consideration that the contravening conduct occurred over a significantly longer period than the 61 day period in relation to which a selection of detailed email records is provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 

 The parties also say at para 47: 
 
 Mr Atkinson is not able to estimate the volume of emails he caused to be sent by the Sancash affiliates to persons in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It should be noted that those emails contained in the attachment to these submissions comprise only those reported to the ACMA by members of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">That this sample represents such a significant number of emails reported per day indicates that the extent of the conduct and volume of emails was very high .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">[emphasis added] 
 

 At para 48 of the joint submissions the parties agree that the nature and extent of the contravening conduct is an aggravating factor in this case [emphasis added].</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Although the nature and extent of any loss caused by the sending of the unsolicited commercial electronic messages is not quantifiable, the parties jointly submit that the Court should have regard to the Explanatory Memorandum (the "EM") circulated by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, upon the introduction of the Spam Bill 2003 to the House of Representatives, addressing the international problem affecting the efficient operation of internet telecommunications networks by reason of spam emails and the costs imposed on end-users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Court is directed to the following passage from the EM: 
 
 The dollar cost of spam is inherently difficult to estimate, but the following provides some appreciation of the orders of magnitude involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 

 
 
 A European Union study in 2001 estimates that the worldwide cost of spam to Internet subscribers could be in the vicinity of &#8364;10 billion (A$18.4bn) per year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A recent study from Ferris Research estimates that US companies alone lost US$8.9 billion (A$15.2bn) in 2002 and estimate that the cost of spam in Europe was US$2.5 billion (A$4.3bn).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">According to figures from Star Internet, a large Internet service provider in the UK, the cost to business in lost productivity is estimated at &#163;326 (A$915) per employee each year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Surfcontrol recently estimated that spam cost employers approximately $1 per spam received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Erado's 2002 white paper on spam, viruses and other unwanted content estimates that annual cost of spam per employee is around US$1000 (A$1709).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 

 
 
 These sorts of costs are usually borne by Internet users (and/or employers), through increased download times and lost productivity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Spammers themselves, on the other hand, bear relatively small costs in sending these messages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">E-mail costs do not scale like sending surface mail or making telephone calls - the cost of sending out a million e-mails is not significantly more than the cost of sending out a hundred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">... 
 

 
 
 The extremely low cost of sending spam, meaning that even a 'hit rate' of below 1% can be profitable, is the biggest single factor leading to its growth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 

 As to s 24(2)(c) , the circumstances in which the contravention took place are outlined in the agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">As to s 24(2)(d) , Mr Atkinson has not previously been found by the Court in proceedings under the Spam Act to have engaged in any conduct similar to a contravention of s 16(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Section 24(2)(e) addresses the question of whether Mr Atkinson has previously been found by a Court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">As to that matter, the parties make this joint submission at para 53: 
 
 In December 2008, Mr Atkinson was found by the High Court of New Zealand to have engaged in similar conduct arising from the same underlying facts [ Chief Executive, Department of Internal Affairs v Atkinson &amp; Ors CIV-2008-409-002391, per French J, 19 December 2008].</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Atkinson cooperated with New Zealand authorities to resolve those proceedings, and paid a pecuniary penalty in the amount of NZ$100,000 in respect of contravening emails sent to recipients in New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 

 Mr Atkinson was the subject of proceedings in the United States: Federal Trade Commission v Atkinson &amp; Ors , United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Case No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">08CV5666.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At para 6 of supplementary joint written submissions provided to the Court on the day of the hearing, the parties said this about the United States proceedings: 
 
 United States judgment 
 

 Paragraph 54 of the October submissions refers to proceedings on foot against Mr Atkinson in the United States, arising from the same conduct as is the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Default judgment has now been handed down in the United States proceedings, in the matter of Federal Trade Commission v Atkinson &amp; Ors , United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Case No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">08CV5666.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">An amount of US$15,151,029 was imposed jointly and severally upon Mr Atkinson and Inet Venture Pty Ltd, as equitable monetary relief for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ) and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 ( CAN-SPAM Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">As set out at paragraphs 37 and 53- 55 of the October submissions, s.24(2) of the Spam Act provides that a relevant consideration for the Court is: 
 
 
 if the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so - whether the person has previously been found by a court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 

 The parties submit that the findings of the United States court are relevant and should be taken into account by the Court, but do not amount to prior findings of contraventions that pre-date the conduct the subject of these proceedings, as they arise from the same conduct, and accordingly are not an aggravating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As the penalties sought in the present proceedings are in respect only of such emails as are connected with Australia, the parties submit a penalty in the amount proposed remains appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">On 4 November 2009, default judgment in the United States case was entered against five of the six defendants in the proceeding, including Mr Atkinson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The proceeding, commenced by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), alleged a range of contraventions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the "FTC Act"), concerning contended deceptive practices in connection with the sale of certain purported herbal products and a pharmaceutical medication, some of which involved representations as to sexual enhancement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">There seems to be some correlation between the products in issue and those the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In addition, the proceedings involved contended contraventions of the United States Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act 2003 (the "CAN-SPAM Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Various provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act were relied upon by the FTC in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The essential contention was that Mr Atkinson and others had initiated the transmission of unsolicited computer email messages in contravention of the Act in respect of the sale and promotion of the above products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Court found, on the face of the FTC material, that there had been contraventions of the CAN-SPAM Act, and that: 
 
 (A) the total amount of consumer injury caused by Defendants Lance Thomas Atkinson and [Inet Ventures Pty Ltd, a corporate defendant of which Mr Atkinson was found to be the sole officer] for the sale of their Hoodia Products [herbal products] Male Enhancement Products, prescription drugs, and other products through illegal commercial email messages is $15,151,029.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 

 In those proceedings a range of findings were made in relation to the pleaded conduct and judgment was entered in favour of the FTC against Lance Thomas Atkinson and Inet Ventures Pty Ltd, jointly and severally, in the amount of $15,151,029 for violations of the FTC Act and the CAN-SPAM Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The relevance and utility of the United States proceedings is simply that the Court should note that Mr Atkinson has been the subject of proceedings in the United States which in some respects bear similarities to the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The United States proceedings will not fall within the scope of s 24(2)(e) simply on the footing that prior to the determination of a pecuniary penalty, a court in a foreign jurisdiction has made findings concerning the conduct of Mr Atkinson which, as to the distribution of electronic messages, bears some similarities with the conduct in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It seems to me that on the question of penalty, s 24(2)(e) is directing the Court to take into account conduct on the part of Mr Atkinson, the subject of findings by a foreign court in respect of similar conduct to the conduct the subject of these proceedings, which occurred prior to the contraventions of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It is true that the United States proceedings do not represent a foreign proceeding in which findings were made adverse to Mr Atkinson prior to the contraventions alleged in these proceedings between 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is not clear from the judgment precisely when the conduct in respect of the United States distribution of electronic messages occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Further, the proceedings involved contraventions of both the CAN-SPAM Act and the FTC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In addition, the findings arose out of an application for judgment in default of appearance on all counts after service of the proceedings on all defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The parties made joint submissions as to the deliberateness of the contraventions of the Spam Act and the period over which it extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">At para 57, the joint submission provides: 
 
 The conduct was highly deliberate , in that Mr Atkinson intended and facilitated the sending of large volumes of spam emails, over a period of some 14 months from October 2006 until December 2007, which ceased only with the intervention of authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Mr Atkinson profited directly from the contravening conduct, and engaged in it for the [purpose] of obtaining those profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">[emphasis added] 
 

 Particular emphasis is given in the submissions at para 59 to the cooperation Mr Atkinson has provided to the Authority in seeking resolution of the issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Paragraphs 59 and 60 are in these terms: Mr Atkinson has co-operated with the ACMA in jointly seeking resolution of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Atkinson made substantive admissions to the ACMA at a relatively early stage of the investigation, obviating the need for time-consuming and costly evidence-gathering and forensic investigation on the part of the regulator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">While admissions were initially made in the course of compulsory examination, rather than on a voluntary basis, Mr Atkinson proceeded in a co-operative manner following the examination, and provided documents and information to the ACMA on a voluntary basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Mr Atkinson's consent to the proposed orders, and admissions in the proceedings, will also assist in minimising the impact of the proceeding on the resources of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">As to the totality principle, the parties jointly submit that the conduct represents one class of conduct comprising a sequence of contraventions all of the same kind or character, and thus, it is appropriate to aggregate the contraventions and treat them as a single contravention made up of many parts notwithstanding that many unsolicited commercial electronic messages were caused to be sent by Mr Atkinson on each of the 61 days within a pattern of conduct over a 14 month period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">There have now been three judgments of the Court in respect of contraventions of s 16 (among other provisions) of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">They are, Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399; (2006) 155 FCR 377 per Nicholson J; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 ; (2009) 261 ALR 326 per Logan J; and a further ex tempore judgment by Logan J on 16 December 2009 concerning further respondents in the Mobilegate litigation ( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd (No 6) [2009] FCA 1533).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The decision of Nicholson J in Clarity1 , involved conduct on the part of the corporation of sending 270,305,474 commercial electronic messages between 10 April 2004 and 13 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In the majority of these contraventions, Clarity1 had used harvested addresses in contravention of s 22(1) of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Mansfield, the second respondent, was found to have aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contraventions and to have been knowingly concerned in or a party to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Court found Mr Mansfield to have been "closely involved" in the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The proceedings were contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Nicholson J made findings of fact in a primary judgment and addressed the question of the pecuniary penalty in the judgment cited above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Nicholson J took these matters into account: it was difficult to quantify the loss or damage caused by the conduct and thus the presence of loss or damage was treated as a possible aggravating circumstance; the contraventions involved a "huge volume" of electronic messages described by witnesses as "annoying, time consuming and frustrating" resulting in responses through filtering and blocking software; since the contravening conduct was the first conduct to be prosecuted under the Spam Act and the respondents genuinely believed that their conduct did not involve a contravention, these circumstances amounted to "an important factor in their favour"; the respondents had not been found by the Court to have engaged in previous contraventions; although the conduct of the respondents was deliberate, the deliberateness was an expression of their belief that their understanding of the new law was correct; and, the issue of capacity to pay a pecuniary penalty, although a relevant factor, was of less relevance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty meeting the objective of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">His Honour applied the totality principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">On the question of cooperation, the applicant acknowledged that the respondents had not attempted to hinder or prevent it from conducting its investigation of the respondent's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The applicant contended that cooperation flowed from the fact that at no time did the respondents entertain the possibility that their conduct might contravene the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The respondents vigorously opposed the position asserted by the applicant that they had not shown any cooperation in relevant respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Nevertheless, one point of distinction between Clarity1 and the present proceeding is that the respondents in Clarity1 contested the proceedings because they believed their conduct did not involve a contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Thus, they simply sought to ventilate their view of the quality of their conduct in the face of new legislative provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">In these proceedings, Mr Atkinson, in the face of enforcement proceedings, exhibited genuine cooperation with the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In approaching the assessment of the pecuniary penalty, Nicholson J considered that there is a need for "commercial realism in fixing penalties".</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">He also said this: One difficulty which emerges in the application of the pecuniary penalty provisions in the new Act is that the maximum penalties are so high as to give rise to "an unrealistically large penalty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The unrealistic character derives principally from the quantum of penalty viewed in relation to the capacity of either respondent to pay and the need for general as well as specific deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It is not just the total quantum of a pecuniary penalty which can provide the element of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That quality derives from a consideration of the penalty in relation to the conduct giving rise to it and the financial capacity of the offenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Where the financial capacity is not great, a [lesser] pecuniary penalty in value will derive its quality of general deterrence from its magnitude in relation to that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">[As to a penalty of $9.9m sought against Clarity1 ] A penalty in the amount of $9.9 million is clearly one beyond the capacity of Clarity1 to pay and so likely to lead to its liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It is quite disproportionate to the commercial realities of Clarity1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Even as proposed it is in the particular circumstances "an unrealistically large penalty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It is overly weighted in favour of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Importantly, it does not appear to be constructed on any allowance of the new character of the legislation and the entitlement of the respondents to test their view of the effect of the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Similar views were expressed in relation to the pecuniary penalty sought against the individual, Mr Mansfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In the end result a pecuniary penalty of $1m was imposed upon Mr Mansfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The pecuniary penalties imposed in the matter amounted to approximately 5% of the maximum penalties possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In Mobilegate , Logan J was addressing conduct involving the sending of unsolicited short-message-service messages to the mobile telephones of users who had been deceived into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate , the first respondent, or Winning Bid , the second respondent, under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and form relationships via dating web-sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Logan J described the respondents as "predators on the emotionally vulnerable for reward" which was "a particularly vile form of behaviour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">His Honour said the conduct was "duplicitous and exploitative" and "cruel and callous".</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">His Honour concluded that this class of conduct warranted a "very substantial penalty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Among a number of considerations his Honour noted that the conduct was deliberate and covert and that penalties must be sufficiently significant to "deter the unscrupulous from taking a calculated business risk" but should not be so high as to be "oppressive" in the sense contemplated in Trade Practices Commission v Stihl ChainSaws (Aust) Pty Ltd [1978] FCA 104; (1978) ATPR 40-091.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In addition, the evidence demonstrated that there was approximately $4m of financial loss on the part of individual mobile telephone users who were charged communications fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">His Honour found that the conduct was "of such an intimate exploitive nature that the exploiter by the very conduct gives itself, himself or herself, a degree of insulation at a practical level from suits for financial recovery" and the conduct involved a "consistent pattern of studied deception".</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It was deliberate contravening conduct with no mitigating circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">In addition, there was no evident cooperation in the administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The entity, Mobilegate , was ordered to pay $5m which represented 6.87% of a possible maximum of approximately $72,820,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The entity Winning Bid was ordered to pay $3,500,000 representing 8.51% of a possible maximum of $41,140,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">So far as the individuals were concerned, Logan J took into account that their involvement was extensive, knowing and persistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">However, in examining the implications which might be drawn from statutory maximum pecuniary penalties in the context of individuals found to be parties to contravening corporate conduct, Logan J considered assessment of the maximum penalty as a "theoretical exercise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Significant pecuniary penalties were ordered against the individuals having regard to the quality of their engagement in the conduct of the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There is little point isolating the amount of each penalty in respect of each individual in the circumstances of the findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Clearly, it is important to take into account the scale of penalties the Parliament has selected as the appropriate range leading to a maximum penalty in respect of contraventions of particular legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Often, careful attention will need to be given to the Parliament's selection of maximum penalties as an expression of the Parliamentary intention that particular conduct, must be transparently deterred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">This is entirely consistent with Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In addition, the Regulation Impact Statement at p 4 of the EM sets out the following statement of the problem sought to be addressed by the Spam Act at p 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">
 
 B.1 Problem or issue identification 
 

 
 
 Unsolicited electronic messages or "spam" are reaching plague proportions and growing exponentially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is causing immense frustration and reduced productivity for users, businesses and government agencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">If left unchecked it will reach proportions which will threaten the viability of the internet as a reliable communications medium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">A recent comprehensive review of the problem by the National Office for the Information Economy recommended a multi-layered approach to addressing the problem, including the implementation of specific anti-spam legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">
 

 The EM describes the problem so identified as an international problem affecting the efficient operation of internet telecommunications networks and imposing costs on end-users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">At p 5, the EM notes, "There are clear signs of a deleterious impact on the performance of the global e-mail network with some commentators predicting that the continuing proliferation of spam could mean the end of e-mail as an effective form of communication".</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">At p 67, the EM contains this observation in relation to penalties: 
 
 A daily ceiling for penalties has been set that may be charged for all contraventions against a particular provision that have occurred in one day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">This has been included to ensure that a meaningful penalty may be charged for a single contravention without causing an unrealistically large penalty payable for multiple contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">For example, there are reported cases of dedicated spammers sending millions of unsolicited commercial electronic messages each day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Without a ceiling amount for daily contraventions, such a spammer could potentially be liable for a million contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The ratio between the penalty payable for a person for single contravention and the ceiling amount is 20 times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 

 Conclusions
 Accordingly, I propose to approach the assessment of the pecuniary penalty jointly put to the Court by the parties on this basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Firstly , I have taken into account each of the considerations identified in s 24(2) of the Spam Act in determining whether the proposed pecuniary penalty is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That question is to be approached by taking into account all of the relevant considerations including the criteria at s 24(2)(a) to (e) and any additional matters that enable the Court to determine whether the proposed penalty is within the range of penalties that might be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Secondly , I consider that the decisions of the Court in Clarity1 and Mobilegate engage factors which significantly differentiate those cases from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Clarity1 was a fully contested proceeding involving a different class and scale of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">There was no cooperation in relation to the proceeding because the respondents took the view that their conduct did not involve a contravention of the relevant provisions especially in circumstances where the legislation had not been tested and no judicial determination was before the respondents which may have aided their analysis of the various integers contained in the sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The respondents in Clarity1 cooperated in the conduct of the case but not in the sense of accepting the contention that its conduct contravened the Spam Act , so as to avoid the applicant incurring the costs of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The decision in Mobilegate involved truly reprehensible predatory conduct of a kind which warranted a penalty directed emphatically towards specific deterrence and transparent general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The class of conduct the subject of Mobilegate is not evident in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Thirdly , however, as to the class of conduct on the part of Mr Atkinson, there is simply no doubt that Australian citizens find large-scale distribution of unsolicited commercial electronic messages promoting the sale of products, in the circumstances of this case, very irritating and annoying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It causes all users of computers to constantly update spam filters and other protective devices to try to deflect the unwanted rain of electrons and digits disseminated by those who wish to do what Mr Atkinson has done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Parliament has made its intention plain that the unsolicited distribution of electronic emails (spam) is to be discouraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Notwithstanding these considerations, the Court ought to take into account and attach significant weight to Mr Atkinson's cooperation with the Authority in isolating the extent of the conduct and in seeking to resolve the present claims on the basis of admissions and a joint submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Fourthly , Mr Atkinson is represented by independent lawyers and he has formed his view as to the various matters the subject of the submission with the assistance of that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Fifthly , from the regulator's perspective, there is much to be gained, in the public interest, in reaching the consensus reflected in the joint submission which, in truth, is a calculus of competing considerations which take their distilled form in the joint submission as a result of a range of considerations and, no doubt, positions put; some accepted; some rejected; and many negotiated, with a view to addressing the contraventions without the necessity of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Plainly enough, significant costs will be avoided for the Authority as a result of this approach to the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Court time will be saved and matters of other litigants will be allocated to Court time that would have been consumed in hearing the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Sixthly , although Mr Atkinson has been the subject of New Zealand proceedings, I note that he also cooperated with the New Zealand authorities in resolving the matters in issue in that jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">I note that Mr Atkinson contends in the joint submissions that he made some attempts to prevent the distribution of the emails to Australian addressees although the attempts are undocumented and undefined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Nevertheless, I accept that some attempt was made to prevent that distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Seventhly , in assessing whether the quantum of the proposed penalty is appropriate in all the circumstances, I have taken into account the agreed position concerning the facts of the contraventions; the unquantifiable but recognised costs and losses imposed on users by conduct such as Mr Atkinson's conduct; the highly deliberate character of the conduct engaged in for profit-making by Mr Atkinson; the attempts by Mr Atkinson to counteract filters used to prevent spam communications from reaching Australian users; and the other considerations earlier mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Eighthly , although the pecuniary penalty is a matter for the Court to determine ( Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72), and the question of whether the Court ought to make declarations as to particular matters or injunctions framed in a particular way or at all necessarily involves discretionary considerations and questions of utility, the Court will attach significant weight to a negotiated settlement quickly reached between parties acting with the benefit of legal advice, provided the document identifies the conduct precisely; the responsibility of each respondent in that conduct is recognised (whether at the centre or at the margin); and the proposed penalty is within the range the Court would impose and is thus not manifestly inadequate: Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285; Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd (No 2) (2009) 178 FCR 199.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The approach to the assessment of a pecuniary penalty under the Spam Act ought, in principle, to reflect some of the considerations applied by the Court in assessing a pecuniary penalty under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In particular, the Court will have regard to the elements of specific and general deterrence and assess whether a proposed penalty might be so high as to be oppressive in all the circumstances: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301; TPC v Stihl Chainsaws (Aust) Pty Limited ; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v ACCC at 293.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">I am satisfied that the proposed pecuniary penalty is within the range that the Court would impose, although I take the view that the proposed penalty in the joint submission is towards the lower end of that range having regard to the concessions made on the facts and the criteria informing the determination of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">However, Mr Atkinson's cooperation is a significant factor in determining whether the penalty is within the range and thus not manifestly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The proposed penalty of $210,000.00 is one which will impose specific deterrence upon Mr Atkinson and suggests to the broader community, as a matter of general deterrence, that contravention of the Spam Act attracts significant penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">In addition, the public recognition that early and close cooperation with the Authority, when confronted with conduct in contravention of the Spam Act , is likely to significantly mitigate the pecuniary penalty ultimately imposed, is in the public interest, by creating incentives for contraveners to cooperate early and comprehensively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The parties jointly urge the Court to make a declaration in the following terms and order that the respondent be restrained, in the following terms: 
 
 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 

 The respondent, between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, by, in the course of his operation of the Sancash Business, 
 
 
 1.1 recruiting individuals ("the Sancash Affiliates") to market particular products via the internet ("the Sancash products"); 
 

 
 
 1.2 receiving and paying commissions in respect of sales of the Sancash products as a result of internet marketing by Sancash Affiliates; 
 

 
 
 1.3 communicating electronically with the Sancash Affiliates in relation to the Sancash Business; 
 

 
 
 1.4 creating and registering, and causing to be created and registered, domain names and providing and causing to be provided those domain names to the Sancash Affiliates, which domain names were to be included as links in electronic messages sent by the Sancash Affiliates to market the Sancash products; 
 

 
 
 1.5 providing and causing to be provided subject lines to Sancash Affiliates for use in electronic messages sent by the Sancash Affiliates to market the Sancash products; and 
 

 
 
 1.6 providing customer service support for orders for the Sancash products generated by the Sancash Affiliates by the electronic messages they sent, including dealing with flawed orders and responding to customer queries, 
 

 
 
 caused to be sent by the Sancash Affiliates electronic messages which: 
 

 
 
 1.7. were sent for the purpose of offering to supply, or promoting, the Sancash products, and were thereby commercial electronic messages within the meaning of s.6 of the Spam Act ; 
 

 
 
 1.8 were not designated commercial messages within the meaning of Schedule 1 of the Spam Act because the messages contained other than factual information with or without directly related comment; 
 

 
 
 1.9 were accessed by computers, servers or devices located in Australia, and sent to electronic-account holders who were individuals physically present in Australia when the message was accessed, and thereby had an Australian link within the meaning of s.7 of the Spam Act ; 
 

 
 
 and has thereby caused to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 

 
 
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 

 The respondent be restrained for a period of seven years from the date of order from sending, or causing to be sent, or being knowingly concerned in or party to any person sending or causing to be sent, unsolicited commercial electronic messages from a person in Australia to anywhere, or from anywhere to persons in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">
 
 ... 
 

 As to the declarations and injunctions, I am satisfied that the discretion ought to be exercised in favour of making the declarations and an injunction restraining Mr Atkinson as sought, subject, however, to the amendment suggested below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Mr Atkinson is to be ordered to pay to the Commonwealth of Australia, in respect of his contraventions of the Spam Act , a pecuniary penalty in an amount of $210,000.00, such penalty to be paid within 60 days of this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">A further order will be made by agreement that the respondent pay the applicant's costs of and incidental to these proceedings in an agreed amount of $15,000.00 within 60 days of this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The injunction is to be expressed in these terms: 
 
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 The respondent be restrained for a period of seven years from the date of this order from sending, or causing to be sent, or being knowingly concerned in or party to any persons sending or causing to be sent, an unsolicited commercial electronic message as that term is understood for the purposes of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) or unsolicited commercial electronic messages for the purposes of that Act from a person in Australia to anywhere, or from anywhere to persons in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Associate:
