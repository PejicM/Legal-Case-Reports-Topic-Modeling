 1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.
Penalty  2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty:  &#8226; Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16] &#8226; The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17] &#8226; It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53] &#8226; The "overbearing and provocative" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24] &#8226; The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43] &#8226; The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37] &#8226; That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43] &#8226; The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71] &#8226; "ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.
" [52] 3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.
Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.
5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.
12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.
16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act.
Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.
The applicant have liberty to apply to the Court within 28 days of the date of this order, for an order requiring the respondent to pay to Mr Colin Williams an amount by way of compensation as the Court thinks appropriate.
