<sentence id="s0">
 Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") instituted proceedings under ss 459A , 459B , 459P and 464 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act") seeking to wind up Bowesco Pty Ltd on the ground of its presumed insolvency by virtue of s 459C of the Act as a receiver and manager was appointed to it by Suncorp Metway Limited on 3 March 2006 pursuant to a floating charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Bowesco is the trustee of the Dyson Family Trust whose principal beneficiaries are the children of Mr Norman Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">A trial was conducted before me between 25 and 27 March and on 11 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At that time I reserved judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Between then and 1 September 2008, Bowesco filed several affidavits seeking to adduce further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">One of these sworn by Ms Karen Sandra Carey on 1 September 2008, annexed a copy of a Deed of Release by Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd , in respect of a debt of $1,055,959 owed to it by Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">This evidence comes more than 2 years after the proceedings commenced and nearly 5 months from the date that judgment was reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">ASIC has conceded that by reason of the receipt into evidence of the Richstar Deed of Release that Bowesco was likely to be able to prove its solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I granted ASIC leave to discontinue on this ground on 3 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The only question which I am asked to resolve concerns costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">ASIC submits that, but for the belated receipt into evidence of the Richstar Deed of Release, it would have succeeded in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It seeks the costs of the application including costs in the cause, reserved costs and costs where there was ordered a liberty to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Costs principles
 The position in this case is somewhat unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Following the trial I considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties and prepared, in draft, my reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">If the proceedings had not been discontinued, I would have made orders that Bowesco be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I have annexed to these reasons my amended draft reasons for so concluding, which I have edited to some extent from the draft reasons, which I had already prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These draft reasons necessarily reflect the position as it was before the Richstar Deed of Release was executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">This is not a case where proceedings have been discontinued before trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In such cases it is relevant to consider and determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them: South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported Federal Court 10 February 1989, Pincus J); Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Both parties have filed written submissions going to the question whether their own and the other's conduct was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It is not necessary to consider these submissions in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Where leave to discontinue is required, as in this case, O 22 r 2(3) of the Federal Court Rules 1976 (Cth) does not provide expressly for the incidence of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Accordingly, I approached the matter having regard to the general discretion under O 62 r 3(1) underpinned by s 43(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160 at [12] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In this case, given the conclusion I had already reached, costs would have been ordered in favour of ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is no reason to depart from that usual result now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">ORDERS 
 Having regard to the conclusion I reached in the substantive proceeding albeit that it was discontinued prior to judgment, there should be an order that Bowesco pay the applicant's costs in the proceeding including any costs ordered to be in the cause as well as any reserved costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Associate:
 
 
Dated: 23 March 2009 
 
 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr C Slater 
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission 
 
 Counsel for the Respondent: Mr M de Kerloy 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: Mony de Kerloy 
 Date of Hearing: 25-27 March, 11 April, 11 June, 8 August, 
3 September 2008 
 
 Date of Judgment: 23 March 2009 
 DRAFT REASONS FOR PROPOSED JUDGMENT ON MERITS 
 The Westpoint Group of companies raised finance and undertook significant building construction projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd ("Lanepoint") is a direct subsidiary of Bowesco Pty Ltd ("Bowesco") and both are related or associated companies within the wider Westpoint Group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Bowesco became subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to floating charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">ASIC has applied to wind up Bowesco on the basis of this presumption: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastland Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The jurisdiction of this Court to wind up companies is conferred by the Corporations Act s 459A and s 459B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">ASIC has standing to make the applications under the Act s 459P and s 464.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The presumption that Bowesco is insolvent arises pursuant to s 459C(2) of the Act is sufficient to discharge ASIC's obligation to demonstrate a prima facie case that those companies are insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Bowesco opposes the application on the ground that it is solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">By reason of the presumption, Bowesco bears the onus of establishing its own solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Pursuant to s 459C(3) of the Act the presumption of insolvency " operates except so far as the contrary is proved for the purposes of the application ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Applicable legal principles
 Weinberg J in Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 at [44] summarised the authorities governing the operation of s 459C of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The summary included these propositions: 
 &#8226; The respondent is presumed to be insolvent and as such bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C(2) and (3); Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 235 per Spender J; Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477 per Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

 
 &#8226; In order to discharge that onus the Court should ordinarily be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of the respondent: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1081 per Hayne J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">

 
 &#8226; Unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared: Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (supra); Re Citic Commodity Trading Pty Ltd v JBL Enterprises (WA) Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 232 per Heerey J; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 459 at 463 per Sackville J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 In Equity Australia Corporation Pty Ltd v Falgat Constructions Pty Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 813 ; [2005] NSWSC 918 per Macready JA and in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2003) 21 ACLC 684 Barrett J referred to and accepted as useful the summary by Weinberg J in Ace Contractors above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Although the decision by Barrett J was overturned on appeal, the reasoning by Weinberg J was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (No 2) (2003) 45 ACSR 711 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 1354 ; [2003] NSWCA 163 at [16] Meagher, Handley and Santow JJA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The principle that a respondent must adduce the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position to rebut the presumption was recently considered and applied by Besanko J in Web Wealth Pty Ltd v Helimount Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1376.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">ASIC submits that Bowesco has failed to provide the " fullest and best " evidence of its financial position and failed to discharge the burden of proving solvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Section 95A of the Act relevantly provides the test for solvency: 
 (1) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

 
 (2) A person who is not solvent is insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">

 In Powell v Fryer (2000) 18 ACLC 480 ; [2000] SASC 97 the Court considered causes of action which required proof of insolvency under the definition in s 95A of the Corporations Law being relevantly the same as the current Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">At paragraph [9] Prior J noted the following: 
 The commercial solvency of a company is not proved by merely looking at its accounts and making a mechanical comparison of its assets and liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Insolvency is a question of fact falling to be decided as a matter of commercial reality in the light of all the circumstances with things being viewed as it would be by someone operating in a practical business environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The statutory focus is on solvency, not liquidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Thus it is appropriate to consider the terms of credit or financial support available to the company with which to defray any debts owed to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The question is not to be answered merely by looking at the financial statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">

 Background 
 The Suncorp receivers' appointment is still in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Although the receivers have paid the secured debt owed to Suncorp, they await taxation and other releases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Since the appointment of receivers, Bowesco has sold some property and has earned income from the balance of the property together with interest on deposited funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Bowesco's case as to its solvency relies on the following points: 
 (a) The receivers will or should shortly retire returning company property to Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

 
 (b) Bowesco has assets of value in its leasehold property investments in the form of the Woodvale Liquor Store and freehold property investment in the Petrol Station at Hale Rd Forrestfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">

 
 (c) Bowesco has miscellaneous assets of value in the form of communication tower leases and motor vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 
 (d) The liabilities Bowesco has in the form of intercompany obligations may be ignored and the other claims against it are contingent such that they may also be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

 ASIC submits that: 
 (a) The receivers have not retired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

 
 (b) Even if the receivers retire, Bowesco has debts and claims which have fallen or will fall due and there are insufficient assets to meet them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">

 The table below summarises the evidence of Bowesco and ASIC as to Bowesco's assets and liabilities:

 Accounts 
 Ms Laurie Antonio, Bowesco's bookkeeper, prepared Bowesco's accounts as at 30 September 2007 from internal records and information provided by the receivers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">These were then considered by Mr Carey and authorised by Ms Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Bowesco's September 2007 accounts record the value of its shares in Lanepoint at $8,316,516.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">ASIC submits that Lanepoint is insolvent and the value of Bowesco's investment for the Dyson Family Trust in the form of intercompany loans or in the form of shares in Lanepoint should be entirely discounted to nil or as not likely to be available to meet debts of Bowesco as they fall due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Bowesco's September 2007 accounts record the value of a loan to Westpoint Corporation at $515,614.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Bowesco accepts that, in fact, it does not have that value but submits that it is too difficult to determine its present value for the purpose of considering Bowesco's solvency or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">ASIC submits, and I accept, the loan is not proven and in any event it is unrecoverable and not available to Bowesco to meet its debts as they fall due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Assets 
 Communication Towers 
 Bowesco's September 2007 accounts indicate they carry the value of the leasehold interest in the Optus and Telstra communication towers at $245,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The accounts indicate that figure is based on an independent valuation dated 8 August 2006, it appears, by Mr Worthington of Elders Real Estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The value of the leasehold interest is based on an annual income of $30,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">ASIC submits that the rent, if any is received, is not proven; the basis for the rent not established; and, the value asserted is not demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Bowesco relied on evidence provided by Mr Carey that Bowesco agreed to lease the site of the petrol station to Woolworths Ltd at a rent lower than it wished and in return received a right to lease a space on the adjoining property developed as a shopping centre for use as a site for telecommunication towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">According to Mr Carey, Bowesco occupies the area, free of rent and sub-leases the area for communication towers to Telstra and Optus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Carey produced an "owner statement" from Westpoint Realty, a company in liquidation but in which he retains an interest, which he said indicated that the net rental was $30,597.69 [Exhibit 4].</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In cross-examination Mr Carey was taken to documents concerning the communication towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Mr Carey acknowledged he provided the documents to Mr Bernie Worthington, a former employee of Westpoint Corporation, for the purpose of Mr Worthington preparing a valuation of Bowesco's interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Mr Carey acknowledged his signature on one of those documents, which was an agreement to lease between the owners of the shopping centre and Bowesco, requiring Bowesco to pay $12,000 per annum to the owners of the shopping centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Mr Carey said the documents provided to Mr Worthington did not comprise the completed agreement with the owners of the shopping centre and referred to another transaction involving another company, Eastlands Pty Ltd, which was referred to in the unsigned Optus sublease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Although Mr Carey complained that the completed documents were held by ASIC he conceded that he had made no direct inquiry for access to the relevant documents from ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">ASIC submits that the evidence of Mr Carey is vague and too general to be of assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Mr Carey could not adequately explain how the agreement to which he referred to was not documented on any agreement in evidence and how it could be reconciled with the completely contradictory documents he provided to Mr Worthington for the purpose of providing a valuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Bowesco also called evidence as to the value of the communication towers from Mr Worthington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Worthington's valuation dated 8 August 2006, assessed the value of Bowesco's interest as $245,000 based on the net rental of $24,500 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The same report is relied upon by Bowesco as evidence that its interest in the lease over the communication towers is worth $300,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In cross examination Mr Worthington conceded that he had previously lost his valuer's licence for a period of 3 months as he was found liable for an allegation of negligence in the preparation of a valuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Mr Worthington also conceded to his earlier association with Mr Carey and Westpoint Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">ASIC submits both of these concessions render Mr Worthington's evidence unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In cross-examination Mr Worthington conceded he did not check the veracity of the arrangements he was valuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He did not see properly executed agreements and qualified his report on the basis that the documents were executed and provided that Bowesco could transfer its interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Bowesco has not tendered executed agreements in order to meet the qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In a further affidavit by Ms Carey sworn on 10 April 2008, she deposed that despite conducting her own searches, including through her solicitors and directly with Telstra and in the respect of the Optus sub-lease with Minter Ellison solicitors, she had been unable to locate the lease and sub-lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Mr Worthington indicated that his instructions on the net rental were materially different to the evidence of Mr Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">According to Mr Worthington, Bowesco received $24,500 net of the rent paid to the owners of the shopping centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">ASIC submits this difference of evidence was not reconciled by Bowesco and casts further doubt on the evidence of Mr Carey as to the arrangements concerning the communication towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Worthington's valuation depended on his assessment that the interest should yield 10% per annum, but Mr Worthington conceded that his report identified no analysis by which he reached that opinion other than the nature of the interest being that a leasehold interest was riskier than a freehold interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I have afforded no weight to the valuation report of Mr Worthington, primarily because the lease and sub-lease documents, which are said to underpin his rationale and by reference to which he qualified his valuation report, have not been produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It was, in other respects, flawed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">For example, it did not refer to the sub-lessee's right to terminate the sub-lease without penalty on one month's notice; it did not refer to anecdotal sales evidence, which Mr Worthington said in evidence he relied upon; it did not compare the terms of the leases to any other similar leases or comment on the commercial merits of the subject leases; it did not consider technological or regulatory environment for communication towers and how that may affect the value; and finally that the valuation failed to account for rates and taxes that Bowesco may need to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Bowesco has failed to establish any value to be attributed to these communication towers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Motor Vehicles
 The September 2007 accounts disclose motor vehicles "at cost" at a value of $132,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Ms Carey said that the figure of $132,000 was an at cost valuation based on advice from the "Red Book".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The "Red Book" was not tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Ms Carey conceded that the vehicles were not professionally valued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Bowesco submits that $100,000 would be a "fair value for these vehicles".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I am not in a position to assess the value of these vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It was for Bowesco to establish a fair value by admissible evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It has not done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">No value can properly be described to them for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Bowesco Liabilities
 Income Tax and GST Liability
 The Notice of Assessment annexed to the affidavit of Karen Carey sworn 20 May 2008 is sufficient evidence that there is no tax liability for the year ended 30 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Inter Company Liabilities
 Bowesco asserts that the Dalegrove Trust debt of $330,149 will not be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It also claims to have written off the following liabilities: 
 (a) Dosius Pty Ltd $ 500,000
 (b) Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd $1,055,959 

 Bowesco asserts that the claims were written off because Dosius and Richstar had first written them off and had forgiven and released Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Each is a related company to Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Richstar
 Bowesco offered the evidence of Ms Carey as the sole director of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd. The rationale for writing off the liability to Richstar is the decision by the Court appointed receiver to Richstar in preparing a report dated 24 November 2006 to the Federal Court on the solvency of Richstar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Ms Carey conceded she did not fully appreciate the meaning of writing off the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">ASIC submits, and I accept, that in assessing Richstar's solvency the receiver was seeking to establish which assets Richstar held that were or would be available to meet its obligations as and when they fell due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The receiver rightly assessed Bowesco, being in receivership, as incapable of repaying its loan within a period that would enable Richstar to meet its obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">There is no admissible evidence that the Richstar receiver has written off the debt owed by Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">ASIC has also tendered the orders made against Richstar in the proceedings in the Federal Court (WAD 83 of 2006) in which Richstar's assets were placed under the control of a receiver and subject to asset preservation orders [Exhibit 6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">ASIC submits that by the terms of those orders, and since mid-March 2008, Richstar is prohibited from disposing of its assets without prior leave of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Bowesco debt may not be written off without the appropriate permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">There is no evidence that the permission was sought or if sought would be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It remains, in my opinion, a debt due to Richstar by Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Dalegrove Trust
 Bowesco relies on the evidence of Mr Carey concerning the Dalegrove Trust debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He said that, as director of the trustee for the Dalegrove Trust, he would have no intention of making a demand for payment of the debt of $330,149.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">However, Mr Carey is not a director of Dalegrove Holding Pty Ltd according to ASIC records (Exhibit 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">This stands as prima facie evidence of the information it contains: Corporations Act s 1274(4C)(d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">ASIC submits that Mr Carey's evidence should be discounted and therefore, the suggestion that Dalegrove Trust does not require the obligation to be repaid should be taken as not proven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">ASIC submits that, in the absence of that consideration, the purported waiver or forgiveness is without foundation and not binding on the interests asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">ASIC submits that the evidence of a waiver or forgiveness should be discounted and given no weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The accounting records of Bowesco record an obligation to the Dalegrove Trust in the amount of $330,149.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I do not accept that there is any enforceable waiver or release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It remains a debt owed by Bowesco to the Dalegrove Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Dosius
 A company search for Dosius discloses that as at 27 February 2008, the directors of Dosius were Norman Carey and Karen Carey and its company secretary was Norman Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Mr Carey indicated that there was no demand for repayment of the Dosius debt of $500,000 by Bowesco and that it did not propose to issue a demand for this debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This assertion was based on his view that the Dosius debt was released prior to 30 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">He conceded that his evidence had not identified a deed of release for the Dosius debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The deed of release dated 30 June 2006 was provided to the Court [Exhibit 5].</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">By s 127(1) of the Act, a deed may be executed without use of Dosius' common seal if it is signed by: 
 (a) 2 directors of the company; or
 (b) a director and a company secretary of the company; or 
 (c) for a proprietary company with a sole director who is also the sole company secretary - that director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 However, by subsection (4) "this section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document (including a deed)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Dosius' Memorandum and Articles of Association provides alternate ways for executing specific documents in articles 68 and 84 but those provisions do not relate to a deed of release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Memorandum and Articles of Association discloses no alternate way in which Dosius' directors could execute the release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The deed of release by Dosius is not executed in accordance with the Act and the assumptions about the process of authorising the release and internal company procedures under s 129 of the Act do not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">I find that the debt of $500,000 is owed to Dosius and has not been the subject of an enforceable release by Dosius.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Bowesco has failed to establish that its liabilities do not include the obligations to the Dalegrove Trust for $330,149, Dosius for $500,000 and Richstar for $1,055,959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Westpoint Corporation Preference Claim
 The liquidator of Westpoint Corporation no longer pursues a preference claim and accordingly the amount of $1,150,000 may be disregarded in any consideration of the liabilities set out under para [16] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Receiver's Costs and Retentions
 Bowesco does not acknowledge in its September 2007 accounts any liability for the remaining costs of the appointed receiver or the matters for which the receivers claim an entitlement to retain a provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">ASIC tenders evidence of the remaining costs of the Suncorp receivers and the items where the receivers claim an entitlement to retain property to meet their anticipated exposure to claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">ASIC submits that the retention for anticipated expenses to complete the administration is a liability of Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It was put to Mr Fraser in cross examination that if matters were resolved quickly without dispute that costs in the order of $100,000 would not be incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As mentioned earlier Mr Fraser conceded his anticipated costs reflected anticipated time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">ASIC submits that no alternative estimate was put to Mr Fraser and no estimate other than the $100,000 is in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">$2m run-around
 There was evidence of a series of complex transactions loosely described as the $2m run-around transactions and which, to an extent, involved Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">ASIC acknowledges that no claim has been made to date against Bowesco in respect to this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">ASIC also concedes that the receiver appointed to Lanepoint by Westpoint Management is likely to proceed to a sale of Lanepoint's property and recover its loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In those circumstances, Bowesco's financial position is to be assessed without reference to the potential exposure to other companies involved in the $2m run-around.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Cash Flow
 Ms Carey produced a cash flow in respect of Bowesco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It includes anticipated rental income and anticipated costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">However, the cash flow expresses opinions as to the future and does so without establishing the assumptions on which those opinions may be based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Ms Carey accepted these criticisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I would afford the cash flow no weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">In any event, there is a significant shortfall as between Bowesco's assets and liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The content of the cash flow, even if accepted, does not alter that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">ASIC's Insolvency Submissions 
 The Suncorp Metway receivers, having paid Suncorp Metway's debt, await a release from taxation obligations and from Bowesco and Mr Carey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">They retain some cash and the petrol station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">If needed Suncorp Metway's security extends to the share of the lease of the Woodvale liquor store, the communication towers and the motor vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Until the receivers retire, the assets of Bowesco are not available to meet its obligations, save that taxation obligations incurred during the receiver's appointment will be met from Bowesco's property in the receiver's possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The table of assets and liabilities set out at para [16] above falls to be re-stated in light of my findings, as follows: ASSETS 
 Accrued income 43,932 Rec'ables R&amp;M 907,086 Woodvale liquor 233,000 Hale Rd Petrol 373,000 Total Assets 1,557,018 LIABILITIES

 R&amp;M costs 100,000 Preference claim 
 Dalegrove Trust 330,149 Dosius 500,000 Richstar Ent 1,055,959 Total Liabilities 1,986,108 NET ASSETS 
 (LIABILITIES) (429,090) 
Conclusion
 The value of Bowesco's assets is insufficient to meet its liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Bowesco is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">It has failed to displace the statutory presumption that it is insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Accordingly, there should be an order that it be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">
