<sentence id="s0">
 I have before me an application by the liquidators of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) ("Victorian Families"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) seeking the following relief: The Court approve that the plaintiff, on behalf of the defendant, entering into a written agreement with Geelong Wealth Management Group Pty Ltd ACN 136 854 487 on the terms of the written agreement annexed as RKK-17 to the Affidavit of Rajendra Kumar Khatri affirmed on 5 June 2009 and filed in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The costs of and incidental to this application be costs in the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Such further and or other order as the Court may think just.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The affidavit of Mr Khatri, who together with Mr Ivor Worrell is a liquidator of Victorian Families, was filed in support of the application, and explains the background to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I note that this morning in Court Mr Cowen, on behalf of the liquidators, has also filed submissions in support of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In summary, prior to its liquidation the only business carried on by Victorian Families was as a financial services provider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The most valuable asset of the business of Victorian Families was the ongoing revenue generated by: At the date of the appointment of the liquidators, Victorian Families had a significant client base and the client book was very valuable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However Mr Khatri deposes inter alia that: Mr Khatri deposes that it is therefore important to make every effort to sell the client book of a financial services business as soon as possible where the original business has ceased to trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In his affidavit, Mr Khatri deposes as to the steps taken by the liquidators to market the client book of Victorian Families' business for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The liquidators have successfully negotiated an agreement with Geelong Wealth Management Group Pty Ltd ACN 136 854 487 ("Geelong Wealth Management Group") for the sale of the client book of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">A copy of the sale agreement is annexed to Mr Khatri's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I note that this copy is executed on behalf of Geelong Wealth Management Group, but not by the liquidators on behalf of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Cowen this morning in Court informed me that subsequent to the filing of the affidavit the sale agreement was executed by the liquidators on behalf of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">However, the contract is conditional upon the approval being given by this Court this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Accordingly, I do not consider that this is a case which involves the need for an application for retrospective approval by the Court in relation to s 477(2B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The sale agreement is to be completed on 10 June 2009, however the purchase price is payable in two instalments: As the obligations of the parties will extend beyond three months after the sale agreement is entered into, the liquidators require approval pursuant to s 477(2B) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) before entering into the sale agreement on behalf of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In relation to the sale agreement Mr Khatri deposes that, in summary: It is in the interests of the expeditious and beneficial administration of the winding up of Victorian Families; and It is in the interests of all creditors of Victorian Families generally (both creditors known to him at this time and those as yet unknown) and the sole shareholder of Victorian Families; 
for the liquidators to enter into the sale agreement on behalf of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Khatri also deposes that he is not aware of any circumstances that would give rise to a concern by the Court, whether by way of error of law, bad faith, impropriety or otherwise, that it should not grant its approval for the liquidators on behalf of Victorian Families to enter into the sale agreement on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The major creditors of Victorian Families are identified in para 29 of Mr Khatri's affidavit, although Mr Khatri deposed that he expected further claims to be made including damages claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The liquidators are also of the view that in the circumstances it would not be in the interests of the expeditious liquidation of Victorian Families, the creditors generally, or the sole shareholder for the completion of the sale agreement to be postponed until a meeting of the creditors can be called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In summary, Mr Khatri deposes that speed is important to ensure that the sale agreement proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Section 477(2B) of the Corporations Act provides as follows: 
 Except with the approval of the Court, of the committee of inspection or of a resolution of the creditors, a liquidator of a company must not enter into an agreement on the company's behalf (for example, but without limitation, a lease or a charge) if: 

 
(a) without limiting paragraph (b), the term of the agreement may end; or
 
(b) obligations of a party to the agreement may, according to the terms of the agreement, be discharged by performance;
 
 
 more than 3 months after the agreement is entered into, even if the term may end, or the obligations may be discharged, within those 3 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

 The principles relevant to the exercise of the Court's power under this provision were summarised by Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 as including the following: 
 (1) The court does not simply rubber stamp whatever is put forward by a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">(2) A court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">(3) The role of the court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator's proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which may seem preferable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">(4) In reviewing the liquidator's proposal, the task of the court is --- 

 
(and her Honour quotes from Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1998) 16 ACLC 1 ,642 at 1,650):
 
... not to reconsider all the issues which have been weighed up by the liquidator in developing the proposal, and to substitute its determination for his in a hearing de novo, but simply to review the liquidator's proposal paying due regard to his or her commercial judgment and knowledge of all the circumstances of the liquidation, satisfying itself there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety, and weighing up whether there is any good reason to intervene in terms of the "expeditious and beneficial administration" of the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 (5) Generally, the court grants approval under section 477(2B) of the Act only where the transaction is a proper realisation of the assets of the company or otherwise assists in the winding up of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">

 In my view the proposed transaction can be described as the proper realisation of the assets of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The terms as set out in the annexed sale agreement are clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I am satisfied that there is no error of law or ground for suspecting bad faith or impropriety in relation to this proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I am satisfied that the proposal is an appropriate exercise of commercial judgment by the liquidators, and that the proposal as explained by the liquidators is consistent with the expeditious and beneficial administration of the winding up of Victorian Families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Accordingly, I propose to make the orders in the terms sought this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Associate:
