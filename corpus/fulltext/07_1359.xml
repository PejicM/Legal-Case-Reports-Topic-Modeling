<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The respondent/cross-claimant, Morton Surgical Pty Limited (Morton) seeks a ruling that it is entitled to rely upon an affidavit of Zoran Milijasevic sworn 6 July 2007 notwithstanding that it has been served later than the time limited by the directions of the Court in relation to the filing of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicants/cross-respondents, Inamed Development Company and Inamed Pty Limited (together called Inamed), oppose leave being granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I have decided that leave should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">However, I will review this ruling in the event that Inamed satisfies me that it has been unable to deal with the evidence, either in whole or in part, prior to the commencement of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">As will appear, leave is not granted in relation to all of the material sought to be adduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">As this is an interlocutory ruling shortly prior to trial, and as the argument has been fully recorded on the transcript, these reasons will be in short form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 The deponent is a design engineer who says that, since 1983, he has been working in the medical device design and manufacturing industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The patent in suit is a gastric band for the treatment of morbid obesity and may be regarded as a medical device in the general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Initially, counsel for Inamed submitted that the deponent was not qualified to give any of the evidence sought to be tendered as the field of expertise so far as was relevant to that evidence is the field of bariatric surgery and not medical device design and manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That point fell away for present purposes during the course of argument and no more need be said about it at the moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 It was then contended that none of the evidence of any significance was admissible or, if admissible, was of such little weight that it ought be rejected pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I agree with that submission in relation to a significant portion of the evidence --- namely that relating to construction of both the patent in suit and the priority document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In my opinion, that evidence does not supply technical explanations from the deponent's field of expertise that would assist in placing the Court in the position of a skilled addressee of those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Rather, they constitute the reading of the documents by the deponent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">( Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 155 at [67].</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">) In my opinion, that evidence is not admissible and, if it were, it would be rejected pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I do not need to make a formal ruling as to admissibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I indicate I will not grant leave to read paragraphs 23---39 (inclusive), 46 and 52---56 (inclusive) of the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">4 Paragraphs 40---44 (inclusive) of the affidavit could conceivably be relevant to the issue of inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Standing alone, they would not be sufficient to establish the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">However, the issues raised by s 7(2) and s 7(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) involve a number of factual aspects that may be proved from a number of sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As was said in Jupiters 222 ALR 155 at [154]:
 
 " Section 7(2) of the Act refers to the hypothetical person 'skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That person is wholly hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Much evidence is admissible from persons none of whom would precisely answer the statutory description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Some may be more skilled in the relevant art than others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Some may be skilled and inventive; some may be brilliant; some may be plodders; some may be aware of particular pieces of art claimed to be part of the common general knowledge and others not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is for the Court, having admitted relevant evidence, to come to a conclusion as to the application of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 
 

(See also, generally, Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No 2) (2007) 235 ALR 202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">) It is not possible to rule in advance as to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">5 It is arguable that paragraphs 47---51 inclusive and 57---61 inclusive of the affidavit are relevant to infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I would not prejudge that issue at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">A point was made that, on one view, these are experiments otherwise than pursuant to the applicable Practice Direction and the particular directions in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That may be so, but the experimental nature of the evidence is very slight and easily replicated and I doubt that the evidence would be rejected on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">6 The fact remains that the evidence has been produced at a very late stage, contrary to the directions of the Court, and is in a new field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The endeavour to justify the evidence as being in reply to matters raised by Inamed's evidence in reply is unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The issue goes beyond breach of the orders of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The proceeding commenced in November 2005 and the defence and cross-claim was filed in February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The final hearing has been fixed for 17 September next for some time, with certain witnesses for Inamed to be cross-examined before then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Tender of the disputed evidence will have consequences for Inamed including seeking instructions from and, perhaps, evidence from a similar expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">At the least, cross-examination will have to be prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Even if such instructions and evidence can be obtained, there will be a diversion of effort and resources at a critical stage of preparation of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I might add that hearing and deciding this application has diverted my attention during a busy Full Court sittings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">7 The role of case management is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The wide scope of O 10 of the Federal Court Rules is well established (eg Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 388); see also s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In my opinion, the effect of the decision of the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 on case management has been exaggerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It dealt with a special situation --- prevention of litigating a fairly arguable defence some months before a trial date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Even so, it may prove to be the high water mark of anti case-management philosophy, probably as a reaction to some perceived over zealous case management in New South Wales at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The decision in Sali v SPC Ltd [1993] HCA 47 ; (1993) 116 ALR 625; (1993) 67 ALJR 841, still needs to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In any event, the evidence of one expert is not necessary to achieve the attainment of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">8 However, on balance, justice to Inamed can be done by reserving its ability to show that it has not been able to satisfactorily deal with all or some of the evidence because of its late filing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">If that were established, then the evidence would be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There will also be an order that Morton pay Inamed's costs thrown away by the late filing of the evidence, including costs of and incidental to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Associate:
