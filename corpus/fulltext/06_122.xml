1 In this proceeding the Court has made orders reinstating Mr Colin Williams in his employment with ACI and imposing a monetary penalty on ACI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The only remaining issue to determine is whether the Court should order ACI to pay Mr Williams compensation under s 298U(c) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Union only seeks compensation for non-economic loss which it alleges Mr Williams suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The parties provided written submissions to the Court dealing with the claim for compensation for non-economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The competing contentions 
 
3 ACI contended that, under the scheme created by Part XA of the Act, it is not appropriate to award compensation for non-pecuniary loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It said that an award of that type has yet to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In response the Union referred to the judgment of Madgwick J in Australian Municipal Administrative Clerical Services Union v Greater Dandenong City Council (No 2) [2001] FCA 1076 at [10] where his Honour said, in the context of s 298U(e):
 
 "It must be borne in mind that conduct contravening Part XA may be of many different kinds and may occur in many different circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The statutory phrase is aimed at giving the Court maximum power and flexibility [to] do what it thinks appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Further, the phrase in section 298U(f); "any other consequential orders" in my opinion, refers to orders consequential upon any order of a kind falling within ... subs (b), (c) or (e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">" 
 

4 Further, as I noted in the first judgment published in this proceeding Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662 at [76] , predecessor provisions limited the Court to an order for reimbursement of wages lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">"Compensation" is a broad concept which should not be interpreted in a narrow way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In an appropriate case the Court is able to order compensation for non-economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There is nothing in the scheme of the Act to support the contrary view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I agree, with respect, with the views of Madgwick J as to the flexibility the Court possesses to, in effect, correct injustice by the ordering of compensation beyond the mere reimbursement of lost wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 ACI submitted that if the Court held that it had the power to make an order for compensation which took into account non-economic loss it should be guided by the principles for the award of non-pecuniary loss which have been developed in unfair dismissal jurisprudence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It referred to the judgment of the Full Court of Industrial Relations Court of Australia in Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 144 at 156 where the Court said:
 
 "There is an element of distress in every termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">To ensure compensation is confined within reasonable limits, restraint is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">But in this case there were unusual exacerbating circumstances that make it appropriate to include in the compensation an allowance for the distress unnecessarily caused to Ms Burazin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">These circumstances include Ms Burazin having to suffer the humiliating experience of being escorted from Blacktown's premises by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Having regard to these circumstances, the compensation assessed by the trial judge should be increased by the sum of $2000, to $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">" 
 

6 ACI observed that the only evidence of non-economic loss before the Court was that contained in Mr Williams' affidavit of 14 October 2005 which referred to the financial stress occasioned by his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It said that there was no evidence about any "unusual exacerbating circumstances" associated with the manner of his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 The Union submitted that the passage in Burazin relied upon by ACI did not articulate a "benchmark test" but only stated why, on the facts before the Court, compensation for distress was appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Union contended that there is no warrant for limiting compensation for non-economic loss to situations which are "unusual and exacerbating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">"
 
8 The Union said that Mr Williams suffered an injury in two ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">First, it said that he was not permitted to leave his work premises in a dignified way but was pressed to leave the factory quickly with security summoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Second, it said that Mr Williams' sudden unemployment caused him stress and tension as a result of his family losing the income of its sole breadwinner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">9 The Union conceded that Mr Williams gave no evidence about the impact of ACI's treatment on him on the day of his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It further accepts that some restraint is called for but contends that, in the circumstances, some compensatory order should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It also submitted that some compensation should be given to Mr Williams as a result of his affidavit evidence that his termination caused him shock and emotional strain and placed his relationship with his wife under pressure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Conclusion 
 
10 In the absence of Mr Williams giving evidence about the effect on him of the manner in which he was forced to leave ACI's premises on the day of his termination, it is exceedingly difficult for the Court to assess what compensation should be ordered in respect of that treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The affidavit evidence referred to at [9] above was filed in support of an application for an urgent interlocutory order for reinstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Court, to a large degree, accommodated the concerns of the parties about delay by giving the matter an urgent trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A prompt judgment was later given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">ACI co-operated in effecting the swift reinstatement of Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In those circumstances I do not consider that it is appropriate to make an order for compensation for non-economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The stress and uncertainty suffered by Mr Williams and his family was short lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Any amount of compensation ordered would only be nominal and not worth imposing on ACI which appears to have accepted Mr Williams back into its fold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It has taken no step to seek to stay or delay reinstatement after the Court's judgment of 18 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">11 I make no order as to compensation in the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">To do otherwise would not be acting with restraint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In my view Burazin establishes that something more is required for compensation for non-economic loss than the usual element of distress which accompanies most terminations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Whilst "unusual and exacerbating circumstances" is not necessarily the yardstick, there must be something attending a termination which justifies an order for non-economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Such an order may have been made in this case had Mr Williams given evidence of the effect on him of his ejection from his workplace by security personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Order 
 
There be no order as to compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
