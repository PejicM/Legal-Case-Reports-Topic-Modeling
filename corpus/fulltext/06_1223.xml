 FACTS 
 
 2 I adopt in substance the summary by counsel for the plaintiffs of the material facts appearing from the evidence.</sentence>

<sentence id="s4">4 On 9 May 2005, a Deed of Company Arrangement (the DOCA) was executed pursuant to a resolution of the creditors in accordance with s 439C(a) of the Act at the meeting convened under s 439A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">5 The Deed Fund under the DOCA was constituted by cl 4 and cl 5 of the DOCA which provided for, inter alia, Worldwide Workers to pay certain funds to the administrators at certain times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Deed Fund also included the trading surplus from trading during the administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Pursuant to cl 5 of the DOCA, the Retained Cash in the administration account as at the date of execution of the DOCA also formed part of the Deed Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 Clause 4.7(a) of the DOCA provided that: 
 
 'The Administrators shall hold the Deed Fund, upon trust, for the benefit of the Administrators and for those creditors who become Participating Creditors in accordance with the terms of this Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 

Pursuant to cl 4.7(b) of the DOCA, the monies paid by Worldwide Workers to the administrators were not refundable.</sentence>

<sentence id="s11">8 The administrators did not make any payments by way of dividend to Participating Creditors under the DOCA.</sentence>
