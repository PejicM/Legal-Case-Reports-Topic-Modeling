<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith of 4 February 2009 in which his Honour dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) handed down on 29 July 2008, which affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship refusing a protection visa application by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The delegate interviewed the appellant on 6 March 2008, and on the same day, made a decision to refuse the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant is a male citizen of China born in 1976.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He arrived in Australia on 18 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 24 December 2007, he lodged an application for a protection visa, which a delegate of the first respondent refused on 6 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 4 April 2008, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal affirmed that decision on 18 July 2008, the decision being handed down on 29 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 26 August 2008, the appellant sought constitutional writs in respect of the Tribunal to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Smith FM dismissed that application on 4 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant lodged a Notice of Appeal with this Court on 25 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal had found that the appellant was not a reliable, credible or truthful witness, and gave reasons for that credibility finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On the basis of the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal chose not to give any weight to documents which had been submitted by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal concluded that the appellant had not been harmed in the past, and would not be in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The grounds of the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court were, in summary: The Tribunal incorrectly made its decision on the basis of its adverse credibility finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Tribunal failed to provide the appellant with a fair opportunity as neither the Department nor the Tribunal have provided the appellant with a copy of the recording of the interview with the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is possible that there have been incorrect, improper or inaccurate interpretation at the delegate's interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Tribunal failed to consider the appellant's evidence properly and fairly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Tribunal's finding involved a reasonable apprehension of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal completely ignored the evidence of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal ignored the documentary evidence presented by the appellant and made its finding based on unwarranted assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In the reasons for judgment of Smith FM, his Honour said at [8]: 
 
 The applicant was advised at a first court date before me to consider presenting to the Court further evidence concerning his interviews both by the delegate and the Tribunal, if he maintained grounds of review challenging the adequacy of interpretation at, and the fairness of, those interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, he has not presented any evidence to the Court concerning these, beyond what appears in the Court Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I have no reason, therefore, to doubt the description of the hearing which is contained in the Tribunal's statement of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 

 Smith FM stated, at [11]: 
 
 Following the hearing, the Tribunal sent to the applicant's agent an invitation to comment on three inconsistencies which it had also raised at the hearing, two of which concerned perceived concerns arising from the interview with the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicant responded with a statutory declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">This did not challenge the accuracy of what he was said to have said to the delegate, but sought to reconcile it with his statements to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 

 At [19], Smith FM said: 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is suggested, without any particular instances being identified, that it was possible that there had been incorrect, improper or inaccurate interpretation at the delegate's interview or that there were misunderstandings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is argued: 
 

 
 
 
 It is definitely unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Either the Department or the Tribunal should at least create a fair chance for me to verify accuracy of the audio recording about the Departmental interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 

 Later, at [23], his Honour said: 
 
 ... in the present case, I am not persuaded that any unfairness resulted from the Tribunal's reliance on listening to the audio recording of the delegate's interview, even assuming that I should accept without verification the applicant's submission that he did not have access to that recording.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The applicant had an opportunity to ask for the recording to enable him to respond to the Tribunal's invitation for comments, if this was necessary, and neither he nor his agent made such a request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Rather, as I have indicated, they both accepted what was put to them as accurately reflecting what the applicant had said to the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">There is no evidence before me that it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">... 
 

 A Notice of Appeal to this Court asserts, in the first ground, that the Federal Magistrate erred in making the finding at [8] of his Honour's reasons, which I have set out in [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Of this alleged error, the Notice of Appeal states: 
 
 The key issue is that neither the Department nor the Tribunal have provided me any records in relation to my interview with the delegate, such as copy of recording CDs or transcripts for such an interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">As a result, I am unable to present the Court any evidence concerning my interview with the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 

 At the hearing of this appeal on 15 May 2009, the appellant said: 
 
 The first point I want to say is that the Federal Magistrates Court made other adverse findings [on] my application and actually is unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I haven't been provided audio recording of the interview with the department, so how can I provide that audio recording to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">... the tape recording that I attended the interview with delegate ... was not available to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 

 Later, he said: 
 
 The main reason for the RRT to refuse my application [was] because ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I had given different evidence to the delegate and to the tribunal but, in fact, I have provided the same evidence to both delegate and to the tribunal, but I have never been given the opportunity to prove that actually I did provide the same evidence to both the delegate and to the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 

 The appellant said from the Bar Table that: 
 
 At the end of the interview, I requested the tape, but the department officer finished interview very quickly and just said to me you can go now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 

 Later, the appellant said: 
 
 I did request the tape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Just during the interview I requested the tape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 

 I said, after hearing from both the appellant and Mr Johnson of counsel for the Minister: 
 
 It seems to me that, truly, if in fact the tape shows that there was a request made during, or at the end of the interview, then I may have to hear some further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">If, on the other hand, the tape doesn't support the accusation that was made today ... then I will deal with the matter on the basis of the submissions that have been made today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 

 I then directed that the tape of the departmental interview be produced to the Court within 14 days, and indicated that the appellant could have an opportunity to listen to the tape in the registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">An opportunity was also provided to the parties to make further submissions if they chose by Friday, 26 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The tape recording of the interview was produced, and lies in the registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was submitted by counsel for the Minister that the tape does not contain any evidence supporting the appellant's statement to the Court that he requested a copy of the tape at the interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Counsel for the first respondent indicated in his written submissions that the first respondent had not received anything at all from the appellant since the matter was last before the Court on 15 May 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The first respondent maintains the submissions made to the Court orally on that date, and in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Further, it was submitted by the first respondent that there was no evidence before the Federal Magistrate that the appellant did make such a request to the delegate for a copy of the tape, and if the tape had been in evidence before the Federal Magistrate, it would not have proved that any such request was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Importantly, it was submitted that there was no indication whether the appellant presses, in the light of the contents of the tape, his contention to this Court that he requested the tape at the end of the interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Tribunal's decision was based on its finding adverse to the appellant concerning his credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Smith FM had rejected arguments directed at impugning the findings which the Tribunal had made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Smith FM also rejected the claim that the Tribunal had failed to consider the appellant's evidence fairly and properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">His Honour rejected the contention of bias, finding that the Tribunal's reasoning was "rational", "open to it on the evidence", and showing "a genuine and proper attempt to perform the statutory duty of review given to the Tribunal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The third ground to the Federal Magistrates Court was directed at the Tribunal's treatment of the appellant's documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Smith FM found that the Tribunal had been aware of the documents, having listed and summarised their contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">His Honour, in his reasons, quoted from Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 , at [49]: 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It cannot be irrational for a decision-maker, enjoined by statute to apply inquisitorial processes (as here), to proceed on the footing that no corroboration can undo the consequences for a case put by a party of a conclusion that that case comprises lies by that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 

 Smith FM concluded that there was no jurisdictional error revealed by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court, and that he had not been able to identify any error in the way the Tribunal dealt with the review before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In the appeal to this Court, the claim that the appellant had been denied access to the tape of the interview with the delegate of the Minister, and that, as a consequence, was unable to make good grounds of attack in the reasoning process of the Tribunal, is not made out, having regard to the contents of that interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The tape of the interview does not support the contention by the appellant that he requested a copy of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Importantly, there is nothing in the tape which provides assistance to him in any of the grounds of appeal, either to the Federal Magistrates Court, or to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">There is nothing in the material to support an allegation of bias or apprehended bias by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The reasoning of the Federal Magistrate reveals no error, and in particular, no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Finally, concerning the ground based on a claim that the Tribunal did not consider the nine documents of the appellant, Smith FM was correct to dismiss the corresponding ground argued before him, for the reasons which his Honour gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">There is no appellable error demonstrated in the judgment of Smith FM, nor is there any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The adjournment of the appeal to this Court on 15 May 2009 so as to permit a copy of the tape of the interview between the appellant and the delegate of the first respondent to be obtained had the result that the tape was produced to the registry, and the parties had an opportunity to listen to the tape and make further submissions arising out of that event, should they have so desired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Further consideration of the contents of the tape indicates to me that the appellant's contention that he requested a copy of the tape was not made out, and further, that the tape demonstrates that complaints later levelled by the appellant at the decision of the delegate are not supported by anything revealed in the taped interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">For the above reasons, the appeal to this Court is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I order that the appellant pay the first respondent's costs, including reserved costs, of and incidental to the appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.</sentence>
