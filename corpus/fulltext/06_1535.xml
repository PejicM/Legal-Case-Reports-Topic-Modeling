 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate declining an application for review of a decision of the second respondent (the "Tribunal").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">By that decision the Tribunal declined to grant to the appellant a protection visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the "Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The history of the matter and a brief outline of the facts appear at [1]-[3] of the magistrate's reasons as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant is a citizen of Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He arrived in Australia on 16 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 30 April 2003 he lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 20 June 2003 a delegate of the Minister refused to grant a protection visa and on 9 July 2003 the applicant applied for review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant attended a hearing before the Tribunal on 5 November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 29 January 2004 the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa and handed down that decision on 19 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution for the Convention reason of political opinion arose out of his imputed claimed association with the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) (Maoist).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The applicant stated that whilst he had joined the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) he was approached by friends in the period from 1996 to 1998 who tried to recruit him to the Maoist cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He said that they came to his village about twice each month and sought food and shelter which he gave them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In 1998 the applicant left his village and went to a town called Pokhara, although he returned to his village from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He said that the Maoists continued to come to his home village and harass his family and also came to him in Pokhara.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He claimed that a neighbour had informed upon him to the police as being a Maoist and as a result he was troubled both by the Maoist insurgents and by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant told the Tribunal that he did not himself ever become a Maoist although he did go to a few cultural programmes organised by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He told the Tribunal that he was a Buddhist and that he did not approve of the use of violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The applicant was a Buddhist monk, and for the last two years that he was in Pokhara he wore the habit of a Buddhist monk, which he said, lessened any interference by the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Although adopting the dress of Buddhist monk, the applicant worked in a shop that he owned selling what I take to be Buddhists ephemera.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">' 
 
 

2 In the appellant's original application for a protection visa he claimed to have been a member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ("NCA (Maoist)") and that:
 
 'I was compelled to leave Nepal to save my life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I was harassed by police and Army.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Also, MAOIST threatened me not to leave them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">' 
 

3 He also said that:
 
 'The Police and Army will kill me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 Maoists will also persecute me for leaving Nepal without having their approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">' 
 

4 He said that he had been forced to join the Maoists, that he feared that the ceasefire then in effect would not last and that there would be revenge killings and massacres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He feared that he would be labelled a Maoist terrorist and that the Nepalese authorities would not protect him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He indicated that he would submit a more detailed statement but did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Minister's delegate concluded that the applicant did not face a real chance of Convention-based persecution if returned to Nepal, and that his fear of persecution on return was therefore not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">5 The appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the "Tribunal") for review of the delegate's decision, again saying that he would 'submit or explain my fear in due course' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">As I understand it no written statement was forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However the appellant attended a hearing in the Tribunal and outlined his concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Perhaps unfortunately, no transcript of his evidence has been provided, the proceedings before the magistrate apparently being conducted upon the basis that his evidence was sufficiently clearly set out in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It seems that the appellant asserted that he feared persecution by the Maoists and by the authorities in Nepal, in both cases because of his political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal found against him on both bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It also found that he could, in any event, avoid persecution by the Maoists by relocating to a large city in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">6 In his application to the magistrate for review of the Tribunal's decision, the appellant challenged the Tribunal's finding that he had no well-founded fear of persecution from either the police or the Maoists and its finding as to relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The magistrate found against him in connection with his claimed fears of persecution from both sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">However he found that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error in connection with the issue of relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Nonetheless, the magistrate concluded that in the absence of a finding that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, the Tribunal need not have addressed that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The error was therefore irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">7 On appeal to this Court the parties accepted that the magistrate had correctly identified jurisdictional error in connection with the issue of relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">However the appellant accepted (in argument, although not in his written submissions) that the error would only be relevant if there were a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The appellant did not seek to demonstrate error in connection with the magistrate's finding that he had no well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Nepalese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Thus the only issue with which I must deal is fear of persecution at the hands of the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">If the appellant succeeds on that issue, then the magistrate's finding of jurisdictional error in connection with relocation would dictate that the Tribunal's decision be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">THE APPELLANT'S CLAIMS 
 
8 The appellant initially claimed that he had lived in West Nepal for the whole of his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">He subsequently said that although his family continued to live at that location, he has, since 1998, spent most of his time in Pokhara where he conducts a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He originally joined the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist), but some of his friends joined the NCP (Maoist) and then "pressured" him to join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">As a Buddhist he was opposed to the violent methods employed by the Maoists and so refused to join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">His friends continued to 'harass' him to join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Maoists came from the jungle areas to his home in the village, demanding food and shelter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He said that a neighbour informed the authorities that he was assisting the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As a result the security forces came to his home and questioned him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Maoists continued to visit, demanding food and expressing concern about what he may have told the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">At some stage the authorities threatened to treat him as a Maoist and therefore a terrorist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">9 During 1996, 1997 and 1998 his friends continued to try to recruit him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">They came to his village about twice each month, seeking food and shelter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is not clear whether these were the same visits as those referred to in the preceding paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It seems likely that they were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">After he moved to Pokhara in 1998 he returned to the village quite frequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The Maoists continued to come to his family home and to "harass" his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In Pokhara he initially had fewer problems, but after the police learned that he was there, they and the Maoists commenced to visit him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Counsel for the appellant said that his understanding was that this implied that the Maoists had been informed by the police of his presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">About two years prior to the Tribunal hearing (November 2003) he commenced to wear the dress of a Buddhist monk to avoid adverse attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He had trained as a monk and was selling "Buddha Arts".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On a few occasions the Maoists demanded that he deliver parcels for them and again pressured him to join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He did not become a Maoist, but on three or four occasions he attended cultural programmes organized by the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">He said that he was forced to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In the months immediately prior to his leaving Nepal to come to Australia, he was living in both Pokhara and his village and dressing as a monk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">As a consequence he was not harassed as much as he had previously been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">10 He was questioned at some length about the attitude of the authorities towards him and, in particular, as to why they had not detained him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">He replied that, perhaps, they did not believe that they had enough evidence against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The Tribunal asked him why, if that were the case, the situation would now be different if he returned to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He insisted that the situation was now worse and, 'that both the police and the Maoists would continue to come, and he could be shot by either of them ... ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">This passage is of particular importance for reasons which will appear at a later stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">At some stage the Tribunal asked him why, given that his problems were localized in his village and in Pokhara, he could not relocate to a safe area within Nepal, such as Kathmandu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The appellant said that such a course used to be possible but now that he is a business man, questions would be asked, and the Maoists would locate him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
11 The Tribunal referred to country information which indicated that the Maoists were waging an insurrection, using torture, killing, bombing, extortion and intimidation against civilians and public officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In January 2003 there had been a ceasefire, accompanied by cautious optimism for a negotiated settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">However, by the end of August 2003, the peace process and the ceasefire had collapsed, and there had been an immediate acceleration in violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">12 In its findings the Tribunal observed:
 
 'The applicant claims that he faces persecution by the authorities in Nepal because of his actual or perceived involvement with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In addition he fears that the Maoists could also harm or kill him, and he claims that the authorities will be unable to protect him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">' 
 

13 After referring to a number of inconsistencies in the appellant's claims, the Tribunal concluded:
 
 'Having considered all the evidence before me, and for the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted by the authorities in Nepal because he is seen as being a Maoist or a supporter of the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Nor am I satisfied that he has a well-founded fear of persecution from the Maoists themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' 
 

14 Despite its doubts about the appellant's evidence, the Tribunal accepted his account of his personal, educational and employment background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It also accepted that as a devout Buddhist, he was opposed to the violence used by the Maoists and, as a result, had refused to join the party, despite repeated efforts to recruit him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It also accepted that some of his friends had become Maoists, and that they had "pressured" him to join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It accepted that on some occasions, Maoists had come to his family home in the village, demanding food, shelter and donations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">That claim was consistent with independent information available to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Tribunal considered it unlikely that they had come to the village as frequently as twice each month over a period of years but was prepared to 'give the applicant the benefit of the doubt' and accept that for a period, their visits were as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It accepted that the appellant had been forced to attend Maoist cultural programmes on three or four occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">15 The Tribunal then continued:
 
 'On the applicant's own evidence he initially had fewer problems with the Maoists after he moved to Pokhara in 1998, and although he claimed that their visits later increased, his final evidence was to the effect that when he dressed as a monk he was able to avoid the serious adverse attention of the Maoists (and the authorities) although they still pressured him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 The applicant had not before stated that he was a trained monk, but I accept his evidence in this regard and I note that in the passport on which he travelled to Australia his occupation is stated as "monk" and the picture in the passport evidences that he dressed as a monk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I accept the applicant's evidence that, parallel with being a businessman selling "Buddha Art" he was in fact a monk and I accept his assertion that in the few years before he came to Australia that fact offered him a great deal of protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 On the applicant's own evidence at hearing he was never a Maoist, and I therefore do not accept his assertion in his application to the effect that as a result of that membership and his leaving Nepal without their permission the Maoists would persecute him if he returned to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">At hearing the applicant maintained the claim that if he returns to Nepal the Maoists would continue to visit his home and make demands, and that they might shoot him (see page 9 above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I accept that the Maoists might visit his home in the village or Pokhara and make demands, but I do not accept that such problems in themselves amount to persecution and I do not accept his assertion that the Maoists might shoot him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I find this claim to be fanciful and not supported by the applicant's own evidence to the effect that, despite their visits and attempts to recruit him over many years, the Maoists did not do him any other harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 

16 The reference to 'page 9' in the above extract is of some relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It is there that the Tribunal recorded the appellant's assertion that either the police or the Maoists might shoot him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal's rejection of his claim that he feared being shot by the Maoists related to that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">THE MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 
17 Before the magistrate the appellant asserted that the Tribunal had not considered the possibility that he had a well-founded fear of some lesser harm (ie than shooting) at the hands of the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Of this submission the magistrate said at [9]:
 
 'The Tribunal must deal with the case that is put to it and not some other case that might be more favourable to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The case that was put was that certain activities had occurred which the Tribunal accepted and then there was a submission, not based upon any evidence, that if the applicant returned to Nepal the Maoists would act in a particular way, which did not seem to follow from the evidence previously given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In these circumstances I am quite satisfied that the Tribunal in making its decision about the substance of the applicant's alleged persecution did not fall into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' 
 
 THIS APPEAL 
 
18 The appellant appeals against that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">His submissions tacitly pose three questions, namely:
 
&#8226; What was the ambit of his claimed fear of persecution?</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">&#8226; Did the Tribunal understand the full ambit of that claim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">&#8226; Did the Tribunal deal with all aspects of that claim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">19 I will consider each question in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Ambit of the appellant's claim 
 
20 I have already summarized the evidence as it is recorded in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The appellant's case seems to have been quite narrow and lacking in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In proceedings before the magistrate, he did not tender the transcript of proceedings in the Tribunal as he would have had to do in order to demonstrate that aspects of his case had not been considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">At a very late stage in the course of the hearing in this Court, the appellant sought to tender the transcript, largely as a result of observations which I had made in the course of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However I ruled against the application, given that the matter had proceeded so far, apparently on the basis that the Tribunal had accurately summarized the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I have previously noted that his claims before the Tribunal differed substantially from those set out in his original application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">At pp 6 and 7 of the reasons the Tribunal recorded, concerning his original application, that:
 
 'The applicant's claims to refugee status as outlined in his application for a protection visa are briefly stated and to the effect that he left Nepal because he was persecuted by the police and the army for being a member of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) (Maoist).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In addition he claims that the Maoists will persecute him for leaving Nepal without their permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 He claims that he has been a supporter of communism since his early days at school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Initially he was a member of the Community Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninists) CPN (UML), but later he was forced to the join the Marxists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He had a successful business in Nepal and would not have given all that up if his life had not been at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">' 
 

21 This summary appears accurately to reflect information contained in the original application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It is curious in two respects, given the subsequent conduct of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Firstly, it indicates that the appellant's reason for leaving Nepal was fear of persecution by the authorities, not fear of persecution by the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Fear of persecution from that source, in the event of his return to Nepal, appears to have been based upon the fact that he had left Nepal without their permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The second curiosity is that he claimed to have been a member of CPN (Maoist) but subsequently indicated that he had never joined that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">These two anomalies may well have been fatal to the credibility of his subsequent claim to fear persecution at the hands of the Maoists based upon their previous conduct towards him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">However the Tribunal gave him the benefit of the doubt with regard to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">22 The appellant's reasons for fearing persecution from the Maoists seem to have been associated with their visits to him and his family, "demands" for material support and attempts to recruit him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">At no stage did he suggest that threats were made in order to induce his cooperation or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Although he used the words 'harass' and 'pressure' , there was no elaboration upon their meaning in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">His evidence concerning such visits in Pokhara suggests that the Maoists' demands at that time were for delivery of documents and that he join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Again there is no evidence of any threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">This visiting regime apparently commenced in his village in 1996 and continued, there and in Pokhara, until he left for Australia early in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He was also out of Nepal for other periods during 2002-2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The Tribunal's understanding of his claim 
 
23 The Tribunal understood that he feared harm or death at the hands of the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It also seems to have understood that he attributed his fears to the visiting regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Indeed, that was the whole point of his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">He made one specific claim to fear "shooting" when the Maoists "came", presumably a reference to anticipated future visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The Tribunal's treatment of his claims 
 
24 The Tribunal treated as fanciful his claim to fear being shot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Given the circumstances in which it arose, that treatment was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Tribunal clearly understood that the appellant apprehended a resumption of the visiting regime and accompanying demands in the event that he returned to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">However it was aware that over the many years during which past visits had occurred, there had been no violence or even, on the appellant's evidence, threats of violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The Tribunal said:
 
 'I accept that the Maoists might visit his home in the village or Pokhara and make demands, but I do not accept that such problems in themselves amount to persecution ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">' 
 

25 The appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to consider whether violence might attend future visits, particularly if he were unable or unwilling to give further support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">It may be possible to infer from the appellant's account that the Maoists' demands for sustenance and support were framed in language, or set in a context, which might suggest that a failure to co-operate would be met with violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">However the fact is that he did not allege any previous threats or menacing conduct or any apprehension of possible violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He did not suggest that others had, to his knowledge or understanding, suffered violence as punishment for non-co-operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He did not suggest that meeting the Maoists' demands had caused, or would cause economic hardship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">26 The requirement, in order to establish refugee status, is that the appellant have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, in this case, political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Assuming that demands for material support and that he join the Maoists are capable of being attributable to the appellant's political opinion, it is nonetheless difficult to see how such conduct can be described as persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">"Persecution" is defined in s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the " Migration Act ") as follows:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that article unless: 
 
 
 
 
 (a ) that reason is the essential and significant reason, or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons, for the persecution; and 
 (b) the persecution involved serious harm to the person; and 
 (c) the persecution involved systematic and discriminatory conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2 ) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes of that paragraph: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; 
 (b) significant physical harassment of the person; 
 (c) significant physical ill-treatment of the person; 
 (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's capacity to subsist; 
 (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist; 
 (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
 
 
 
 
 ...' 
 
 

27 Mere demands would not usually satisfy any aspect of the definition of "serious harm".</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Subsection 91R(2) is not an exhaustive definition, but it accurately reflects the common meaning of the words "serious harm".</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Demands, particularly by friends, would normally amount to persecution only if tangible and credible threats were offered as the alternative to co-operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">There is no evidence of such threats in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It was for the appellant to explain his reasons for fearing persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The Tribunal's rejection of such fears as being without foundation reflected the appellant's case which was based upon a history of demands without actual violence or threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">If the Tribunal's reasons for rejecting the appellant's claims were somewhat terse, they reflected the terse nature of those claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There was nothing more upon which to focus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The Tribunal's view that the appellant had no well-founded fear of persecution was open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">No jurisdictional error is demonstrated in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">RELOCATION 
 
28 In the appellant's outline of submissions, he submits that the magistrate erred in holding that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider relocation, given its finding that there was no well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In oral submissions counsel for the appellant seemed to concede that the magistrate was correct in this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In any event, I consider that he was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The issues involved in relocation can only be finally resolved after the relevant fear has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It may sometimes be desirable that findings of fact be made in connection with relocation even where there has been no finding of a well-founded fear, but failure to do so will not constitute operative jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I need not say any more about this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">ORDERS 
 
29 The appeal will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">I will hear submissions as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.</sentence>
