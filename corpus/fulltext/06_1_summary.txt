 Background to the current application  1 The applicants Sharman Networks Ltd ('Sharman Networks'), Sharman License Holdings Ltd ('Sharman License') and Ms Nicola Anne Hemming ('Ms Hemming') are each the subject of asset preservation orders made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 ('the Mareva orders').
In the meantime, Ms Hemming had filed two disclosure affidavits pursuant to Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 whilst Sharman License and Sharman Networks had unsuccessfully sought several stays on various grounds of that same order insofar as it applied to them (see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 406 per Hely J, delivered 8 April 2005; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 441 per Wilcox J, delivered 15 April 2005 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 per Moore J, delivered 28 April 2005).
Sharman License and Sharman Networks had also unsuccessfully sought an enlargement of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal from Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 (see Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 per Lindgren J, delivered on 17 June 2005).
3 On 24 May 2005, the Music companies filed a further amended notice of motion seeking further orders ancillary to the Mareva orders, which application was heard over several days by Moore J and determined by his Honour on 17 November 2005 substantially in favour of the Music companies ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1587).
'   5 The immediate background to much of the debate presently raised by the Sharman applicants, and as a consequence the principal focus of their attack upon the orders of Moore J below, concerned the existence of alleged shortcomings in the asset disclosures, and in particular the implications of a payment of $1,116,405.63 made by Ms Hemming to a Vanuatu company, Trustees International Limited ('TIL'), following upon the sale of the Sydney residence of Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber for $2,100,000 on 4 February 2005, being a payment made purportedly by way of repayment of a loan.
I observe that it is well accepted that those criteria are not to be applied rigidly or fixedly, and the Court must bear in mind all of the circumstances of the particular case: see in that regard Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, where Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:  'For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria.
19 Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos [1999] QB 271, Waller LJ (with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed) said in a passage at 290, upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance:  'It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that cross-examination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order: see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 181, per Slade LJ.
The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind...'  The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens, referred to by Waller LJ above, reads as follows:   'I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases --- perhaps most cases --- the court might not consider it "just and convenient" to order the cross-examination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order, in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned...'  Whether there has occurred 'purported compliance with a Mareva order' must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form.
The 'anxieties expressed by Scott J', and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank , appear in Scott J's earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540.
The Sharman applicants postulated that the 'remark' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that '[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a "client services agreement" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002' was an 'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment.
That submission lacked merit, particularly in the light of [31] of Lindgren J's reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the two-fold acceptance, given in cross-examination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J, that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks, and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement, Ms Hemming 'controlled the Sharman trust'.
It was submitted however on behalf of the Sharman applicants that so much did not imply that Moore J was satisfied that there had not been compliance with the order of the court to disclose assets by Ms Hemming, which affirmative finding was of course contended by the Sharman applicants to be a prerequisite to the making of an order for cross-examination; I was referred for comparison to Planet International v Garcia (No 2) (1991) 1 Qd R 426, where the following appears at 427 of Thomas J's reasons for judgment:    'In the present case I am satisfied Mr Garcia has not adequately complied with the order of the Court.
'  Earlier, at [4], his Honour had observed:   'On 4 February 2005, Ms Hemming and Richard Kilmer-Barber settled a sale of their home at Castle Cove in Sydney to John Simon Myers for $2,100,000.
'  33 After reviewing in some detail the Australian authorities relating to misuse or abuse of process and of Mareva orders, and also the evidence placed before him in the present segment of the proceedings, in particular that concerned with Ms Hemming's apparent control of Sharman Networks, and Wilcox J's conclusions thereon, Moore J expressed his satisfaction that Ms Hemming should be required to swear a disclosure affidavit in relation to Sharman Network's assets, largely for the reasons I have already canvassed and which I will reproduce below, the same having been the focus of much of the respective parties submissions made in the present interlocutory proceedings (at [36] and [37]):  'This leads to a consideration of whether [Ms Hemming] should be cross examined on her affidavits concerning disclosure of her assets.
