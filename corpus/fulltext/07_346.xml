<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant is a delegate of the Employment Advocate appointed under Part IVA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WRA').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He brings these proceedings against the third, fourth and fifth respondents alleging that Mr Oskam made false and misleading statements to three employees of the first respondent ( 'Sunland' ) concerning their obligation to join the third and fourth respondents as members, in contravention of s 298SC of Part XA of the WRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It is alleged that Mr Oskam did so on behalf of the third and fourth respondents (the 'CFMEU' and the 'CFMEU Qld' respectively) in some representative capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant seeks declarations as to the contraventions, the imposition of pecuniary penalties and orders compensating the employees for the sums they have paid by way of membership fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The conduct in question in these proceedings occurred prior to the coming into effect of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">These proceedings were brought under s 298T of Part XA of the WRA prior to those amendments and it is not disputed that the application falls to be determined under the Act as it then was (and see Regulations 2.19 and 4.53 of Chapter 7 of the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 One of the principal objects of the WRA is to ensure freedom of association, including the rights of employees to join or not to join an organisation or association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Part XA of the WRA is concerned with that freedom and s 298A(a) states that an additional object of the Part is to ensure that employees are free to join industrial associations of their choice or not to join industrial associations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Section 298C, in Div 2, provides that Part XA applies only to the extent provided in that Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Section 298D is entitled 'Organisations' and provides that the Part applies to: 
 
 '(a) conduct by an organisation; and 
 (b) conduct by an officer of an organisation acting in that capacity; and 
 
 
 (c) conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's membership or non-membership of an organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">' 
 

4 Sections 298E and 298F apply the Part to conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's participation or non-participation in industrial action and other activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Section 298G provides that the Part applies to conduct by a constitutional corporation and conduct that adversely affects a constitutional corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">A 'constitutional corporation' is defined by s 4 to include financial and trading corporations within par 51(xx) of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 Section 298SC provides in relevant part that: 
 
 'A person must not make a false or misleading representation about: 
 ... 
 (c) another person's obligation to join an industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">' 
 

6 Applications may be made to the Court for orders under s 298U in respect of conduct in contravention of Part XA: Div 6, s 298T.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Section 298U relevantly provides that the Court may make orders imposing a penalty upon a person or industrial association (par (a)); or an order requiring the payment of compensation to an employee (par (c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 Each of the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) (which I shall also refer to as 'the unions' ) are bodies corporate and 'industrial associations' as defined by s 298B(1), that which definition includes an association of employees that is registered or recognised as an association under industrial law and which has, as a principal purpose, the protection and promotion of employees' interests in their employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Industrial associations may also be an 'organisation' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The CFMEU is an ' organisation ' registered under the Registration and Accountability of Organisations Schedule to the Act and therefore comes within the definition of an ' organisation ' in s 4(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The CFMEU (Qld) is an organisation registered under the Industrial Relations Act 1999 (Qld), but such an organisation is not included in the definition of 'organisation' for the purposes of the WRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 Section 298SC is alleged by the applicant to have been contravened by the making of representations by Mr Oskam to each of the three employees: Robert Holz, Cameron Dann and Dean Angus, in September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It is alleged that the following statements were made by Mr Oskam: 
 
 '6.2.1 Oskam said: 'The three of you have to join the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 
 
 
 
 6.2.2 Dann asked: 'Do I have to be in the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.2.3 Oskam said: 'Yes you do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.2.4 Holz said: 'I don't want to join the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.2.5 Dann said: 'I don't want to join either.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.2.6 Oskam said: 'If you don't [join the union], you will either get sacked, or all the other blokes in the workshop will go on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.2.7 Oskam said: 'You have to join [the union].</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">There is no way you can work here without being in the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">'' 
 
 
 

9 A contravention of s 298SC is not an offence to which the criminal standard of proof applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The civil standard of proof applies and the Court must be satisfied that a case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Section 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides: 
 
 
 '(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 
 
 
 
 (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and 
 (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and 
 (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">' 
 

10 And in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 (at 362) Dixon J said that: 
 
 'The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences following from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 

11 The strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove: Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66 ; (1992) 67 ALJR 170 at 170-171; [1992] HCA 66 ; 110 ALR 449 at 449-450 and see Employment Advocate v Williamson (2001) 111 FCR 20; [2001] FCA 1164 at [42] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">As their Honours pointed out in Neat Holdings [1992] HCA 66 ; 67 ALJR 170, statements that clear, cogent or strict proof is required in cases such as fraud are not directed to the standard of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They reflect a conventional perception that people do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a court should not lightly make a finding to that effect in civil litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In Employment Advocate [2001] FCA 1164 ; 111 FCR 20, that approach was applied to proceedings under Part XA of the WRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The view was there expressed that it is not common in Australian society for people to engage in conduct proscribed by legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">An allegation that someone has done so is ordinarily a grave allegation, particularly where it might lead to a significant penalty (Branson J at [67], Kenny J agreeing).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">12 Mr Holz commenced work with Sunland on about 19 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">He was responsible for Mr Dann and Mr Angus joining the company shortly afterwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He is the senior of the three and appears to have some measure of influence with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He said that on about 8 September 2004 the three of them were working at the spray booth of the factory when they were approached by a person called ' Dan '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It is not disputed that this was Mr Oskam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Oskam also worked at the factory and Mr Holz knew that he was a union representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Mr Holz says that Mr Oskam brought over some forms and put them on a work bench in the spray booth area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The forms contained an application to join each of the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He says the following exchange occurred: 
 
 'Dan said, 'The three of you have to join the union'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">


 
 I said, 'I don't want to'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 Cameron said, 'Do I have to be in the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">' 
 
 Dan said, 'Yes, you do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 I said, 'I don't want to be in the union'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 Cameron said, 'I don't want to join either'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 Dan said, 'If you don't, you'll either get sacked or all the other blokes in the workshop will go on strike'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 Dan then said, 'It's only $200 a year and it comes out of your pay'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">' 

13 He then says in his evidence: 
 
 'I can recall Cameron repeating that he didn't want to be in the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The conversation ended with the following exchange: 
 
 I said, 'I don't want to be in the union; I've never been in the union'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 He said, 'You have to join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">[Everyone will go on strike and you'll shut the whole place down].</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is no way you can work here without being in the union'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 

(Parenthesis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This account is taken from Mr Holz's affidavit sworn on 25 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He agreed in cross-examination that that part in parenthesis did not appear in a statement taken from him in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That account did however contain words to the effect that ' the workshop will go on strike '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">14 Mr Dann's account, as set in his affidavit of the same date, is in these terms: 
 
 '[Dan placed a form on a bench at the spray booth and said, 'Here boys have a look at this'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 
 
 
 
 Bob said, 'Do I have to join this shit?</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 
 Dan said, 'Yes you have to be in the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Everyone here is in the union'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">] 
 
 I said, 'Do I have to join the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">' 
 
 Dan said, 'Yes, otherwise the whole factory will go on strike'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 Bob said, 'I don't want to be in it'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 Dan said, 'Well you have to be in it'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 I said, 'I don't want to be in it either'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 Dan said, ['Either you join the union or you will get the sack or the factory will go on strike'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">]' 
 
 
 
 

Mr Dann agreed that those parts in parenthesis did not appear in his earlier statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">15 The other employee approached by Mr Oskam on that day, Mr Angus, also gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In his affidavit he said that he had told Mr Oskam that he didn't want to be in the union and that he recalled Mr Oskam saying words to the effect ' you have to be in the union or else everybody here will go on strike '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I was not persuaded that Mr Angus was entirely reliable as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I do not refer in this regard to his credibility, but rather to his lack of memory of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Neither Mr Holz nor Mr Dann refer to Mr Angus having made the statement that he didn't want to be in the union; Mr Angus freely concedes that he has no recollection of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">As to the balance of his statement, that a strike might result if they did not join, I would not be inclined to accept his evidence that this was said unless it is corroborated by other, acceptable, evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I would also place little or no reliance upon his agreement with the account given by Mr Oskam, to which reference will be shortly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It seems to me that Mr Angus was an entirely suggestible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">16 Mr Oskam had been a union delegate for about two and a half years, although he had received no training in aspects of that role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">His account of the conversation was in large part drawn from his usual practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He said the same thing more or less to any person he was seeking to make a member of the unions namely: 
 
 'Look guys, it's a Union shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">We would like you to be in the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">If you want better wages and conditions it's in your interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">' 
 

17 Mr Oskam's reference to ' the Union ' I take to refer to each of the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld), third and fourth respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">He says that by the term 'Union shop ' he meant that most workers were union members and the employer recognised the union and negotiated EBAs (Enterprise Bargaining Agreements) with the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He denies that he told the three men that they were required to join the union and he denies that either Mr Holz or Mr Dann said that they didn't want to join the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He specifically denies that he said they would be sacked or other employees would go on strike if they did not join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">18 It is not disputed that, at the conclusion of the conversation between the three employees and Mr Oskam, the cost of joining the union and the method of payment was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Each of them signed an application to join the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 Mr Dann gave some further evidence under cross-examination concerning the application forms which included the membership cards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In his affidavit he had said that they had signed a form entitled ' Authorisation to deduct union dues from wages ' and that ' a little later ' Mr Oskam came around with the cards for them to sign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Pressed under cross-examination, he said that by the reference to a ' later time ' he meant later that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He then recalled that was because Mr Oskam did not have enough of the cards and had to go and get some more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">No other witness' evidence suggests this recent version of events to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">20 At some point each of the three employees authorised the deduction of union dues from their wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In October 2004 they received statements from the unions requiring payment of union dues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This is said to have led Mr Holz to contact the Building Industry Task Force where he spoke to Mr McGann and subsequently received brochures about union membership and industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He said that Mr McGann advised him to keep notes about what happened at work, but it may be that the focus of any such advice was upon conversations which had taken place with the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In any event it is not clear that it was directed towards anything that had occurred with Mr Oskam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">21 Mr Oskam says that about three months after Mr Holz had joined the union he came looking for him and asked ' How do I get out of the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He advised Mr Holz that he would have to write and resign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It appears that Mr Holz contacted a person at the offices of the unions and arranged to have forms for resignation sent out to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Subsequently he rang that office in Brisbane on 4 November 2004 to obtain a telephone number of the organiser, Mick Booth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He telephoned Mr Booth to discuss resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He was asked in cross-examination why he did this when he had already arranged to have a resignation form sent out to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In particular he was asked whether he was trying to provoke a union official.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The conversation must have been a little curious to Mr Booth because at one point he apparently asked Mr Holz if he was taping the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Each of the employees resigned in late October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Each of Mr Holz and Mr Dann had paid the sum of $200 for union fees in this period and Mr Angus the sum of $50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">22 Mr Jenkinson was at this time an investigator of the Task Force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">He became involved in the investigation of the incident the subject of the proceedings against the first and second respondents in November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">He had a number of conversations with Mr Holz commencing on 3 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">His principal concern, at this early point, appears to have been with the second respondent, for he attended at the office of the first respondent to speak with him on 9 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">He attended with another officer of the Task Force on 12 January 2005 to take statements from Mr Holz and Mr Dann at their workplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The statements were taken separately by each of the officers and typed as the employee spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">A printed copy was subsequently provided to Mr Holz who signed it on 17 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr Dann's statement was provided to him and signed on 1 February 2005, when Mr Jenkinson attended upon him and Mr Angus and took the latter's statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">On this occasion a printed copy was able to be provided to Mr Angus upon completion of his statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">23 On 25 February 2005 Mr Jenkinson took a statement from Mr Oskam at the office of the first respondent in the company of the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The statement was recorded, with Mr Oskam's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">After preliminary discussion the following exchange took place: 
 
 'WJ You mentioned the fact that this workshop here is a Union shop, do you remember that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 DO Yeah 
 
 WJ Can you just tell me again for the record here what your understanding of a Union shop is?</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 DO Basically, you have to be in a Union to work there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">
 
 WJ And, who ah 
 
 DO If you're non-union, you're not labour so everyone joins up and they're all free to join and as soon as the new people start you ask them if they want to join, yes, no worries 
 
 WJ What if a new starter didn't want to join?</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 DO Well, they should have asked them if they wanted to first 
 
 WJ Yeah 
 
 DO But it's up to them I suppose, if they don't want to join, they don't want to join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 
 WJ Would they, given that you think it's, given that you understand it's a Union shop, what would happen to the new started if they didn't want to sign up?</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 
 DO Ah, basically if you didn't want to sign up you wouldn't be entitled to EBA award rates, anything like that, RDOs, we pay to put those things in place, so if you're not in the Union you're not going to be entitled to any of those, are you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 WJ When you say 'we pay' ... 
 
 SL [ui] 
 
 DO Basically, yeah, if you're not in a Union you're not entitled to EBAs or anything like that, you get the standard pay rate ...' 

24 An earlier exchange, when Mr Oskam used the term ' Union shop ' does not appear to have been transcribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">However on his own account he used the term in his conversation with the three employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He was not led into using it in the conversation with Mr Jenkinson, as was suggested in submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">His understanding of the term is perfectly clear, as may be seen by the answer he first gives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">He understood that a person had to belong to a union in order to work at the factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">This is how the term would commonly be understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">His later explanations, relating to the benefits which union members receive, do not detract from the clear expression of his understanding nor does the later attempt, in his affidavit filed in these proceedings, to resile, to an extent, from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">He then said: 
 
 'I said words to the effect of: - 
 
 'Look guys, it is a Union shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">We would like you to be in the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">If you want better wages and conditions it's in your interest' 
 
 By the term 'union shop' I meant that most workers were union members and the employer recognised the union and negotiated EBAs with the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 These are standard things I say when recruiting people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">' 
 

25 Given Mr Oskam's belief that the factory was a ' Union shop ' and his understanding of what that meant, it is not difficult to infer that it was likely he said that the three employees had to become union members in order to work there, even if he did not use the words ' Union shop ' on this occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">I therefore accept Mr Holz's account that Mr Oskam conveyed to them that they were obliged to join and that they could not work there unless they did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The reference to ' the union ' was to each of the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) which were identified on the application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The question which remains is whether he also made statements to the effect that, if they did not join, either they would lose their employment or the other employees at the factory would go on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">26 Mr Dann was frank in his concession that he and Mr Holz subsequently discussed the events and the conversations which had taken place on the day in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It is not however obvious that they did so with any degree of precision prior to their statements being taken in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Those statements, being close in time and less likely to have been subjected to a process of comparison or further emphasis, as may have occurred with the later affidavits, are more reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">I place no weight upon the words added to their accounts in their later affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In any event for the most part they repeat what Mr Oskam is alleged to have said would occur if they did not join the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The respondents also submitted that the accounts should be rejected as unreliable because the witnesses could not now recall when the conversation in question had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I do not consider that follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">27 Shorn of the later additions, Mr Holz's account contains two predictions alleged to have been made by Mr Oskam: that if they did not join the unions their employment would be terminated or the other employees would strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">28 The respondents submit that the statement about their employment being terminated could not contravene s 298SC because it cannot be shown to be false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Mr Holz's employment was in fact terminated ' for the reasons that included the reason that Holz was not a member of the third and fourth respondent '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">This is a reference to the terms of an admission made by Sunland in the proceedings against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The respondents seek to adopt it for the purposes of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">If the admission is relied upon as a statement of fact in these proceedings it might however work against the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It might tend to suggest that that was the understanding which existed between Sunland and the unions at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">That might, in turn, render more likely the prospect that Mr Oskam, knowing this to be the case, made some statement to the effect that they would lose their positions if they did not become union members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">This was not however a matter put to him and I would not draw any such inference for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It would be one bordering upon speculation, without more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That leaves Mr Holz's affidavit as the only source of evidence that the statement was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The termination of his employment did occur in early December 2004 and he understood it was because of the dealings he and the others had had with the unions and their refusal to remain members of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">This understanding may have affected his later recollection, of what had been said at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Mr Oskam said words to the effect that, in order to work there, they had to join the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">This raises, but leaves unanswered, the question whether something might happen to their employment if they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Mr Holz might unconsciously be providing further content to the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I would not act upon his evidence where there is no other reliable evidence from another witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Mr Dann's reference to it was by way of addition to his earlier statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">This tells against the likelihood that he recalled it being said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">29 Despite Mr Oskam's denial, I accept that Mr Holz and Mr Dann each said that they did not wish to be members of the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">That was the case, as their resignations shortly afterwards confirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">That is why Mr Oskam had to be adamant, pointing out that they had no real choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">They had to join in order to work at Sunland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The question then is whether he is likely to have said more in order to persuade them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">I think it likely that he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Here were three employees who clearly did not want to join a union and did not immediately succumb to the suggestion that they must do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Each of the three witnesses gave evidence that Mr Oskam said that the other employees would strike if they did not join.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">I am satisfied that Mr Oskam made such a statement and that it was influential in them joining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">30 The advice to the three employees, that they were obliged to join the unions in order to work at Sunland, was false and misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Subject to a submission advanced by the unions, that the section contains a further requirement relating to Mr Oskam's intention, s 298SC(c) has therefore been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The further statement about strike action being taken may be said to be 'about' their obligation to join and therefore within the purview of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">It may be seen as misleading because it connects the prospect of such action with the suggested obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">If it does not imply that the action is lawful, it is silent about the fact that it is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">31 It was submitted for the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) that an essential element of a contravention of s 298SC is the intention to make a false or misleading representation, relevantly, about a person's obligation to join an industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It was submitted that the appellant must prove that Mr Oskam made the statements deliberately, knowing that union membership was not compulsory, and that the evidence does not permit of such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">If that proof were necessary, however, s 298V of the WRA would apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">That section provides, in summary, that if in an application under Div 6 it is alleged that the conduct of a person or an industrial association was or is being carried out for a particular reason or with a particular intent, that reason or intent is presumed unless they prove otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The unions submit that the section cannot apply because the applicant has not expressly pleaded reliance upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">More to the point, perhaps, is the fact that it did not plead intention as relevant and it was therefore unnecessary to be negatived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">As Kenny J pointed out in Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; [2001] 106 FCR 482 at [80] , s 298V is only attracted where a specific intention is a separate element of the wrong created by the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">32 Section 298D(c) cannot be the source of an element of intention for the purposes of s 298SC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">It speaks of a general intention concerning a person's membership of an organisation, which Mr Oskam clearly had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Further, s 298D, and the other sections in Div 2, do not operate to create an additional requirement to sections which proscribe conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Sections 298D to 298H are concerned to characterise conduct to which Part XA of the WRA may apply, and to connect it with a head of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">33 The CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) submitted that a requirement of proof of intention was to be implied in s 298SC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The words of the section however contain no hint of such a requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The unions submit that the nature of the contravention, which involves false and misleading statements, may require it and this was confirmed by a reading of the WRA as a whole or of Part XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">34 A reference to a statement being false or misleading does not necessarily imply that it was made knowingly so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The cases upon which the unions relied in support of their argument were concerned with s 298M, which contains the element of inducement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">An object of Part XA is the maintenance of the freedom of employees to join or not to join industrial associations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Section 298SC(c) sees that freedom as impaired if false or misleading statements are made about the employee's obligation to become a member of the association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It is concerned with the effect upon the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">So understood, the state of mind of the person making the statement is irrelevant to the question whether the provision has been breached, although it may be relevant to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">35 It is not every statement of the kind referred to in s 298SC which amounts to a contravention of Part XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The application of the Part is limited in the way provided in Div 2: see s 298C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The conduct in question must be that conduct referred to in ss 298D to 298H, as Cooper J pointed out in Rowe v Transport Workers' Union of Australia (1998) 90 FCR 95 at 100, 106.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is submitted that in the present case Mr Oskam's conduct comes within s 298D(b) and (c), which is to say, the conduct was by him as an officer of an organisation acting in that capacity or it was conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's membership or non-membership of an organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The latter conduct is said to be referable to the conduct concerning membership of the CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is necessary at this point to consider his position with each of the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">36 Mr Oskam refers to himself as a member and 'delegate' of the two unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">What he means by 'delegate' is not gone into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) do not admit that he was a delegate, but do admit that he was a representative of 'the third and/or fourth respondent' and an 'officer of the third and/or fourth respondent within the meaning of s 298D of the Act' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">That section, by par (b), refers to 'an officer of an organisation acting in that capacity'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">An officer of an organisation, by s 4, is a person who holds office in the organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The CFMEU (Qld) is not an organisation within the meaning of the WRA, as previously mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is an industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">An officer of an industrial association is defined by s 298B(1) to include a delegate or other representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">37 At this point something needs to be said concerning the admissions made by the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">They assume some importance in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Regrettably the allegations that Mr Oskam was a representative and an officer of an organisation were expressed to be with respect to the CFMEU 'and/or' the CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The admission by the CFMEU of those allegations is clear enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">They are directed expressly to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The effect of the admission by CFMEU (Qld) is less clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It could not be taken to admit that he was an officer of it as an organisation within the meaning of s 298D(b), for the reasons given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It might be taken to admit that he was its representative, because it goes on to expressly deny that he was also a delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">So much may in any event be inferred from Mr Oskam's apparent authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">38 With respect to the CFMEU, Part XA applies because the conduct in question was conduct by an officer of it as an organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">That does not however conclude the question whether that conduct should be taken as its conduct or that it should be held liable for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Section 298D, and the other sections in Div 2, are not concerned with what constitutes a contravention or the liability of an organisation or other entity for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">39 It was submitted for the CFMEU that the common law rules determine the question of its liability and that it is necessary for the applicant to show that either that Mr Oskam was its 'directing mind' ( Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattras [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153) or, if it is to be held vicariously liable, that he was its agent acting within the scope of his actual or apparent authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In each case this involves a factual enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">For Mr Oskam's authority to be apparent more is required than his holding himself out as authorised, it is submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">40 Section 298B(2) and (3) of the WRA provide: 
 
 
 '(2) For the purposes of this Part, action done by one of the following bodies or persons is taken to have been done by an industrial association: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the committee of management of the industrial association; 
 (b) an officer or agent of the industrial association acting in that capacity; 
 (c) a member or group of members of the industrial association acting under the rules of the association; 
 (d) a member of the industrial association, who performs the function of dealing with an employer on behalf of the member and other members of the association, acting in that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">
 
 
 
 
 (3) Paragraphs (2)(c) and (d) do not apply if: 
 
 
 
 (a) a committee of management of the industrial association; or 
 (b) a person authorised by the committee; or 
 (c) an officer of the industrial association; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 has taken reasonable steps to prevent the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">' 
 
 

(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">41 The CFMEU relies upon statements in Rowe v TWU 90 FCR at 111 and following that this provision does not affect the application of the directing mind principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">That may be so, but Cooper J also explained that the subsection is concerned with the relationship between industrial associations and the individuals, identified in (a) to (d), rather than with a corporation's alter ego, which is the focus of the principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">His Honour said that when the directing mind principle operates, an industrial association will be liable without the need to have recourse to s 298B(2) (and subs (3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">His Honour went on (at 111-112): 
 
 'Indeed, the operation of the principle and the two subsections may overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The subsections were intended to cover relationships between an industrial association and the persons specified in pars (a) --- (d) inclusive who are servants, agents, delegates or representatives of the industrial association rather than its alter ego.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The subsections are also intended to remove the necessity to identify where the line is to be drawn between persons acting as the directing mind of the industrial association and those acting in a representative capacity only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">' 
 

42 Section 298B(2) operates to extend the category of conduct which is, for the purposes of the WRA, to be treated as conduct of the industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">It is not strictly legally its conduct, although it may be conduct for which it is vicariously liable at common law, his Honour observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The statutory object is to prevent an industrial association doing, or permitting to be done by servants, agents, delegates or representatives that which it is prohibited from doing itself, his Honour explained, and went on (at 113): 
 
 'This is achieved by making the conduct of the persons specified in s 298B(2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) the conduct of the industrial association in circumstances where the industrial association may be vicariously liable for such conduct, or the conduct is that of persons having such a relationship with the industrial association that the persons have authority to act on behalf of the industrial association or its members generally and where the industrial association is in a position to prevent or attempt to prevent the conduct occurring by taking reasonable steps as provided in s 298B(3) and failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Section 298B(2) and (3) are part of the means adopted to control the conduct, and to regulate the affairs, of organisations registered under the Act, and, to control the conduct of industrial associations in respect of the affairs of registered organisations and the affairs of constitutional corporations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">' 
 

43 His Honour then dealt with the argument raised, in connexion with the validity of the section, that the Act treats as an incontrovertible fact conduct which is contrary to the true factual situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It is not necessary to refer in detail to his Honour's ruling on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It is sufficient to observe that his Honour held that the argument failed to distinguish between the ascertainment of facts and the legal consequence of the facts as found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">44 The CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) rely upon that part of his Honour's conclusion, that s 298B(2) may require the ascertainment of facts, in support of a submission that the section requires proof of agency or some other basis for liability as required by the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The submission misunderstands the enquiry under the section, which is as to the relationships identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In some cases this may require an assessment of the kind mentioned, for example where the relationship alleged was that of agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In the present case however Mr Oskam was an officer of the CFMEU at the relevant time, acting in that capacity within the meaning of s 298D(b), by that organisation's own admission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">It is not necessary to enquire further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The consequence of s 298B(2) is that his actions are taken to be those of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">45 It was not part of the applicant's case against the CFMEU (Qld) that the conduct in question fell within s 298D(b) so that Part XA applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Rather it was contended that in relation to Mr Oskam's conduct, par (c) of that section applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Section 298D(c) applies the Part to conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's membership or non-membership of an organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Here the relevant purpose can only be connected to membership of the CFMEU as an organisation, not the CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Section 298D(c) may therefore provide another reason why the Part applies to conduct, conduct contravening s 298SC, for which the CFMEU may be liable under s 298B(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The position of the CFMEU (Qld) is however different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">46 The terms of s 298B(2)(b) expose a difficulty in the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The question which arises with respect to Mr Oskam's conduct, so far as it falls within s 298D(c), is whether it was carried out as an officer or agent of the CFMEU (Qld) 'acting in that capacity' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He was clearly its officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">This follows from the extent of its admission and the definition of an officer of an industrial association in s 298B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Given his role as a representative of the CFMEU (Qld), to enlist new members, he would also qualify as an agent for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">It could not however be said that, in seeking out members of the CFMEU, he was acting in that capacity on behalf of the CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The evidence does not permit such an inference to be drawn and no such assumption could logically be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The proper characterisation of the conduct here in question is conduct having the purpose or intent of membership of the CFMEU (Qld), an industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">That conduct does not come within s 298D(1) and Part XA cannot apply on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">47 The alternative approach adopted by the applicant with respect to the CFMEU (Qld) relies upon s 298G.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It provides in relevant part:
 
 (1) This Part applies to: 
 ... 
 (b) conduct that adversely affects a constitutional corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">
 
 
 
 (2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(b), conduct is taken to affect adversely a constitutional corporation only if: 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (b) the person so referred to is an employee of the constitutional corporation ...and the conduct affects the person in that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">' 
 

48 It is not disputed that Sunland was a constitutional corporation as defined by the WRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">For s 298G to apply it must be shown that Mr Oskam's statements adversely affected Sunland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">This can only be established if they affected the three persons, to whom they were made, in their capacity as employees of Sunland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Section 298D(2)(b) looks to an affect on a corporation through conduct directed to its employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">An example of conduct of this kind is provided by s 298Q, which concerns industrial associations acting against employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">It provides, by subsection (1), that an industrial association must not take or threaten to take action which prejudices a person's employment for reasons which include them joining an industrial association or paying a bargaining services fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">49 The applicant relies upon the statement, or prediction, to the employees that if they did not join, strike action would follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">To this may be added the statement that they could not work for Sunland unless they were members of the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The statements have a connexion with their employment but neither can be said to threaten continuation of their employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Indeed the statement about possible strike action is, on one view, directed to the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">What both statements are likely to have done is to put pressure upon the three persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">They imply that their position as employees may not be maintainable if they do not join, at least so far as all the other employees, who are members, are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">They are faced with a choice as to whether they wish to continue their employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Their position as employees is therefore affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">CONCLUSION 
 
50 A case against Mr Oskam is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The statements that the three employees were obliged to join the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld), in order to work at Sunland, and that strike action would result if they did not, were false and misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Part XA applies to that conduct by reason of s 298D(b) and because the CFMEU is an organisation under the WRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">It is liable for the conduct of its officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Section 298G applies the Part to the conduct in connexion with the CFMEU (Qld) because it affected the three employees and this is taken to have adversely affected Sunland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The CFMEU (Qld) is liable for the conduct of its officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">51 The question of appropriate penalties is to be the subject of further submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">There is no dispute that orders for compensation could be made, by which the three employees are effectively to be reimbursed for the membership fees they paid: $200 by each of Mr Holz and Mr Dann and $50 by Mr Angus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">A reference to the applications forms suggests that the fee is payable to the CFMEU and that entitles a person to membership also of the CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">It does not suggest that the CFMEU (Qld) is the recipient of part of the monies, but this is not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">What proportion the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld) should pay of the sums by way of compensation can be clarified on the adjourned hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">52 The applicant also seeks declarations that the unions and Mr Oskam have engaged in conduct in contravention of s 298SC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The declarations proposed would identify the gist of the conduct, as is required: Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91, at [89]-[90].</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Section 298U of the WRA provides that the Court may make any order consequential upon penalties and compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Pursuant to s 21(1) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) the Court has power to make declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The question which arises is whether it is appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">I am satisfied that there is a public purpose in identifying the conduct and the contraventions so far as concerns the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld), but not Mr Oskam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">I will hear from counsel as to the terms of such a declaration given the findings made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">53 The matter will be adjourned to a date to be fixed for argument on the question of penalties, the quantum of compensation and the terms of declarations as to the conduct of the CFMEU and CFMEU (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I certify that the preceding fifty-three (53) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kiefel.</sentence>
