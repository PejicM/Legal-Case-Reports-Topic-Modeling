<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 22 January 2008 I made orders in these proceedings extending from 31 January 2008 current orders under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) against the first, second, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth and twelfth defendants to midnight on 6 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">These orders were subsequently extended, by consent, to midnight on 12 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In the case of the fourth defendant, the current orders were extended to midnight on 25 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 In relation to the first and second defendants, Messrs Carey and Rundle, I excluded from the extension orders, those restraining them from leaving Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In the course of hearing I pointed out to senior counsel for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that it would be a matter for ASIC to justify the extension of the travel restrictions and that if ASIC wanted to do something about it, it could do it urgently within the next few days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 On 29 January 2008 ASIC filed a motion seeking orders in the following terms: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">An order that the time for service and hearing of this Interlocutory Process be abridged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Each of the First and Second Defendants (the Defendants ) are restrained until further order of the Court, from, without consent of the Court, leaving the jurisdiction of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Each of the Defendants deliver up, all passports held by them in their possession, custody or control until further order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 

In the alternative, ASIC sought travel reporting orders in reliance upon s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), they being orders that: 

 
 
 4.1 Each of the Defendants must provide the Plaintiff with 14 days written notice of any intention to travel outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4.2 At the time of giving such written notice, the Defendants must provide to the Plaintiff: 
 
 4.2.1 Evidence that a return ticket has been purchased; and 
 4.2.2 The following information: 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The date of the intended travel;
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The purpose of the intended travel; 
 c. The travel destination or destinations; 
 d. The date of the Defendant's intended return; 
 
 
 e. Whether the particular Defendant is to be accompanied by any person(s), and if so, the identity of that person(s); and
 f. The contact details (ie address and telephone number) of all places the Defendant intends to stay while overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">

ASIC sought an order that the defendants pay its costs of and incidental to the interlocutory process and that the parties and any third parties affected by the orders have liberty to apply to the Court on the giving of reasonable notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 In seeking to extend the travel restraint and, alternatively, to require that the defendants give notice of any intention to travel outside Australia, ASIC has relied upon a variety of affidavits previously read in evidence which deal with transactions and events relevant to its investigations into the collapse of the Westpoint Property and Finance Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 It is not necessary for present purposes to canvass all of the history which has been dealt with in many judgments given since these proceedings were initiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 ASIC relies in particular upon an affidavit of Ms Jan Redfern sworn 30 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">She is its Executive Director Enforcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">After referring to background facts and circumstances she described the status of ASIC's ongoing investigations into whether any criminal offences were committed in relation to the affairs of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">She said that ASIC has recently presented briefs of evidence to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) for consideration in relation to various persons, including Messrs Carey and Rundle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The briefs are said to have arisen out of ASIC investigations previously designated the 'Fundraising Investigation' and the 'Asset Stripping Investigation'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She did not indicate what kind of conduct was under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 Ms Redfern said that the CDPP will be in a position to make a final determination as to whether any charges should be preferred against any person once it has: 
 
 (i) reviewed the relevant evidence; 
 
 
 (ii) advised ASIC of all the further information it requires ASIC to provide or obtain; and 
 (iii) received and reviewed the additional information it has requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 

She also said that as part of the Brief Investigations, ASIC is in the process of offering to various persons, including Messrs Carey and Rundle, a voluntary recorded interview to give them an opportunity to answer questions and provide an explanation in answer to allegations that may be directed against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 Ms Redfern referred to ongoing investigations in respect of which ASIC has yet to provide the CDPP with briefs of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">These particularly concern transactions under examination in the Asset Stripping Investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">These other investigations are likely to be substantially completed by 30 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">She foreshadowed the further use of ASIC's compulsory powers requiring Mr Carey and Mr Rundle to attend an examination or examinations under s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 Ms Redfern referred to ASIC resolutions under s 50 of the ASIC Act to carry on pending proceedings commenced by the liquidators of Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd in which Messrs Carey and Rundle have been named as defendants and by the liquidators of York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It has also resolved to carry on other proceedings in the name of various mezzanine finance companies associated with the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In the Ann Street Mezzanine proceedings allegations have been made against Messrs Carey and Rundle of negligence and breach of their duty as directors in connection with the raising of investor funds by promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The damages claimed in the proceedings are said to be of the order of $27.8 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Recovery would no doubt be of assistance to creditors of companies in the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 Ms Redfern stated that she has been informed by Senior Special Counsel in the Enforcement Directorate of ASIC, that ASIC is examining how the results of its investigations may sit with the claims made and to be made in the proceedings referred to in its s 50 resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">She also said that she had been informed that there is a risk that ASIC's ability to effect service of any future compensation proceedings would be frustrated if any of the defendants named in those actions were not within the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Harking back to her first affidavit, she said that the liquidators of Westpoint Corporation had identified potential claims against Mr Carey which they may wish to pursue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Those claims appeared to be related to some of the matters the subject of ASIC's other investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">If the liquidators do not pursue those claims, ASIC might consider doing so pursuant to s 50 of the ASIC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">11 Ms Redfern said that as a result of the matters referred to in her affidavit she believes there is a real prospect that further assistance that ASIC might require from Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in conducting its other investigations may enhance the recoveries which may be obtained for the benefit of Westpoint Corporation's creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There is a real prospect that the absence from the jurisdiction of either would impede ASIC's ability to seek assistance from them in a timely manner '... because it is not currently possible for ASIC to accurately identify when such assistance will be required'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">12 ASIC submitted in respect of both Mr Carey and Mr Rundle that continuation of the travel restraint orders was desirable given:
 
 
 10.1 A need to protect the interests of aggrieved persons by preserving and securing the presence of Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in the jurisdiction: absent appropriate restraint there is a risk they may leave the jurisdiction and not be amenable to assist ASIC in further examinations pursuant to s 19 ASIC Act or by participating in a record of interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">10.2 The scale and complexity of the ongoing investigations into the Westpoint Group generally --- not only those of ASIC, but also those of the liquidators appointed to various Westpoint Group companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">More time is required for completion of the investigations and both Mr Carey and Mr Rundle are significant persons of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 

13 Although the written submissions refer to a 'necessity' for travel restraints, senior counsel for ASIC properly accepted that their case was based upon their desirability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">That acceptance was proper as the evidence did not disclose any risk of imminent flight or other circumstance which would render continuing travel restraints 'necessary'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">14 Additional matters relied upon in relation specifically to Mr Carey were: 
 
 11.1 The limited cooperation provided by Mr Carey to the receiver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 
 11.2 [His] disposal of property without the prior authorisation of the receiver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">This evidently referred to settlement of legal proceedings which were seen to amount to the disposal of a chose in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I place little weight on that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">11.3 [His] failure to disclose significant overseas assets and his unsatisfactory evidence given during his examinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">11.4 The receiver's conclusion that, as to Mr Carey, although identifying assets or potential assets not disclosed by him, the receiver is not in a position to determine whether he has identified all of Mr Carey's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The receiver has identified further areas for investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">11.5 The claim brought against Mr Carey in respect of Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (In Liq) and the potential further claims against [him] and other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

15 In relation to Mr Rundle, ASIC relied upon evidence of asset dissipation prior to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The transaction relied upon involved the transfer to his wife of his interest in their matrimonial home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It was described in my reasons for judgment given on 9 November 2007 in connection with consent orders affecting Mr Rundle: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 009 071 968 v Carey (No 18) [2007] FCA 1718.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In that case, as I noted, ASIC was prepared to accept the proposed consent orders which dispensed with the continued appointment of a receiver to Mr Rundle's property on the basis that: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The process of identification of the property was complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He had been generally cooperative with the receiver and ASIC expected that he would comply with the freezing orders then proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

16 ASIC drew something of a distinction between Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in its submissions on the basis that Mr Carey remains a key subject of its investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It placed particular emphasis on the disclosure, through the examination process and ancillary Court orders, of his involvement in overseas entities and the movement of certain funds overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">He was said to have failed to disclose a significant involvement over many years with the entities under his control or acting on his behalf in relation to the movement of significant amounts of money at his direction into accounts under his control, located both in Australia and overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">17 ASIC pointed out that in proceedings in the Real Estate and Business Agents Supervisory Board Mr Carey deposed to having total assets with a current estimated value of $1,169,547.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In disclosure affidavits in these proceedings he told the Court and the receiver that he had assets of a mere $69,457.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">One of the additional assets disclosed in the Real Estate and Business Agents Supervisory Board proceedings was an interest in the Westpoint Realty Pty Ltd (In Liq) rent roll said to have an estimated realisable value of $400,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">18 ASIC submitted that in balancing public and private rights in this case, the Court pay close regard to the conduct of both Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in considering the risk that they might absent themselves from the jurisdiction and be unavailable to assist ASIC in further investigations it is currently undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">ASIC accepted that the risk is inevitably difficult to quantify but that it is nevertheless a real risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">19 Mr Carey swore two affidavits in response on 30 and 31 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">He said in the first of those affidavits that he has two children, aged 12 and 15 years, and that his immediate and extended family all lived in Perth and have lived here all of their lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">His children attend local private schools and rely upon his child support payments and other financial support which he has provided and has continued to provide since the orders in this proceeding were first put in place in March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">His employment is in Perth and he relies on his income to meet his child support payments and other expenditure for his children, as well as to provide funds on which to live.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">His academic and professional qualifications are Australian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">20 Mr Carey referred to the adverse public perception associated with ongoing travel restrictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He pointed out that after nearly two years under the present orders made pursuant to s 1323 of the Act only one claim had been brought against him, that is the Ann Street Mezzanine claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He denied that he had ever been a 'shadow director' of that company and claimed to have available to him a number of defences along with claims against other parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">21 He said he was informed by his solicitors that although ASIC purportedly utilised its powers under s 50 on 26 October 2007, his solicitors were yet to receive a sworn copy of the Redfern affidavit announcing that resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">They had not heard or received anything from ASIC advising what was being done in the Ann Street Mezzanine proceedings or in relation to any other mezzanine company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">22 Mr Carey said the financial accounts for Ann Street Mezzanine and Ann Street Development Pty Ltd were audited by KPMG and signed off on an unqualified basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">He said he had not been interviewed by ASIC since July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He claimed to have volunteered to assist with their investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">He also continued to provide substantial affidavit evidence in these proceedings to assist ASIC and the Court to understand the operations of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He had written to the receiver, Mr McMaster, regularly since the second extension of the orders offering to provide him with any additional information or documents with which he could assist him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">23 As to the ongoing criminal investigation, Mr Carey denied any wrong doing in the management of the Westpoint Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He maintained and said he had always maintained that as a director he acted professionally in accordance with his duties and obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">24 Mr Carey said he has no intention of leaving the jurisdiction for the purpose of avoiding his responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">As evidenced by his actions to date he will rigorously defend any action brought against him and seeks to bring to account those persons whom he regards as responsible for the collapse of the Westpoint Group and to endeavour to recover investors' money and reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">25 In relation to the overseas Hilton Trust, he has instructed his solicitors to terminate the trust and repatriate the funds to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">26 In his second affidavit of 31 January 2008, Mr Carey said he had specifically offered to cooperate with the receivers' solicitors in their ongoing investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He referred to other recent correspondence with ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">27 Mr Rundle in his affidavit filed 30 January 2008 said that he is 42 years of age and was born in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Save for occasional holidays and short business trips, he has lived his entire life in this State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He is married with three children aged 14, 12 and 7, all of whom rely on his income as a contract engineer for their food, clothing, accommodation and education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">They all attend school in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">28 Mr Rundle is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He is currently employed by Insignia Contracts Pty Ltd as a Contracts Engineer based in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He is entitled to four weeks annual leave and estimates that his current accrued leave entitlements are approximately one week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">29 Mr Rundle's parents were born in Australia and live in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">His wife's parents were born and live in Busselton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">His brother and sister both live in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He has no immediate or extended family outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He has no assets outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He has never been convicted of any criminal, civil or statutory misdemeanour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">30 Mr Rundle says he currently has no intention of travelling overseas, however he wishes to have his passport returned and his right to free travel restored in line with the rights of every other Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He has no intention of moving to live overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">31 Mr Rundle also referred to recent exchanges between his solicitor, Mr Lemonis and the Australian Government Solicitor about the intentions of ASIC in relation to seeking an extension of the preservation orders made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Although inquiries were made in November and December 2007, he was not informed of ASIC's intention to seek an extension until 21 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He and his solicitor attended a without prejudice meeting at ASIC on 18 January 2008 to discuss continuing asset preservation orders and other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Those discussions are ongoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Relevant principles and considerations 
 
32 The imposition of restrictions upon a person's freedom of movement is a serious step not lightly to be undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Such authority as there is on the imposition of such restrictions under s 1323 of the Act mandates caution in imposing them: Corporate Affairs Commission v Price Commodities Pty Ltd (1987) 5 ACLC 787 at 789-790; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wiggins (1998) 30 ACSR 190; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Ivey (1998) 29 ACSR 391; ASIC v Australian Investors Forum Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 1180 and ASIC v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd [2002] NSWSC 684.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">33 The s 1323 orders were made and have been continued on the basis of ongoing investigations by ASIC and to protect the interests of parties who may have claims in relation to matters arising out of those investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The orders and the associated travel restrictions have been in place for nearly two years, having been first imposed on 20 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">34 In my opinion, ASIC has not made a case for the continuation of the travel restrictions by reference to any imminent risk of flight or disruption to its investigations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It has not been able to make a case of necessity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It has given reasons which are characterised by a degree of generality and uncertainty as to the precise stage of the current investigations and of any possible criminal prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It has relied in part upon transactions previously undertaken by both defendants and by Mr Carey's involvement with overseas entities and lack of cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">35 If there be any concerns about travel by either of the defendants in the context of particular litigation such as the Ann Street Mezzanine proceedings, those concerns can be raised in those proceedings before a judge properly seized of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">If there be concerns about possible travel if and when criminal charges have been laid, those concerns can be raised before the appropriate Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It is not for this Court to speculate upon such matters on the basis of the rather inchoate evidence before it today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">36 On the other hand, I do not consider it unreasonable, in light of the complexity and significance of the ongoing investigations that, for the duration of the general orders, Mr Carey and Mr Rundle give prior notice to ASIC of any intention to travel overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">If ASIC seeks to prevent such travel it will have to do so on the basis of more concrete concerns than have been presented to the Court today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It will have to bear the onus of justifying any further order and paying the costs if it fails to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">37 Each defendant has been involved centrally in a major collapse of a large corporate group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Many investors have been left lamenting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It is a reasonable incident of the other orders made in reliance upon the ongoing investigations that they give notice of pending travel overseas so that if there be any aspect of the ongoing investigation that would be affected by such travel or any likely affect upon the interests of aggrieved persons, ASIC can take appropriate steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">38 I propose therefore to make orders in the following terms: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The restraint orders made against the defendant be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The defendant shall not depart from Australia without giving fourteen (14) days prior written notice to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, such notice to specify: 
 
 
 2.1 the place or places to which the defendant is intending to travel and the dates upon which the defendant is intending to be at those places; 
 
 
 2.2 the dates upon which the defendant is departing and intends to return; 
 
 
 2.3 the airline or airlines or other carriers which the defendant intends to use on his travel; 
 2.4 the defendant's ticketing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The preceding order remains in force until midnight on 12 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">There be no order as to the costs of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">
