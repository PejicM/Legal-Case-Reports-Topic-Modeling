<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application by the applicant for judicial review of a decision of a Registrar of the High Court of Australia refusing the applicant's tender of Appeal Books in support of two separate applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant is unrepresented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondent has filed a submitting appearance and there is no contradictor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The applicant has not appeared today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She has been called in the precincts of the Court sitting in Melbourne and the Court sitting in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 Ms Ogawa sent a letter to my chambers which was received on 15 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In that letter she asked that I do two things; first, transfer the proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court and, secondly, disqualify myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">She wrote in her letter:
 
 'Constable Helen Wheatley of the Queensland Police informed me that the Federal Court was complaining against me alleging that the Court had been threatened by me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I gathered from Constable Wheatley and from the Court brief by the Queensland Police that there was only one judge to whom the alleged threat was directed, and that was His Honour Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Although, I doubt that his Honour can be threatened by the alleged statement that I wanted to throw his Honour out of a window (of a courtroom where there is no window) (through video link from Brisbane,) the serious allegation brought against me demonstrates the conflict of interest between his Honour and myself, or bias, either apprehended or actual of his Honour against me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In the circumstance, I do not believe that his Honour can hear any proceedings to which I am a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 As for the matter of VID 31 of 2006, it now reveals that there is only one simple question involved and there is no associated matter in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The matter is one that can be dealt with appropriately by the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Furthermore, the respondent submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and does not oppose a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I request his Honour to transfer the proceeding of VID31 of 2006 to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' [VID 31 of 2006 is the matter presently before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">] 

4 Last night I am informed that Ms Ogawa called the chambers of the Chief Justice at approximately 4.45pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">She inquired of the Chief Justice's staff whether I had received the letter which she had posted to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Chief Justice's staff informed her that my chambers had received the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">She was also informed that I would hear her in relation to the matters contained in the letter during the hearing today and I would also hear about any other issues that she wished to raise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Ms Ogawa told the Chief Justice's staff that she would probably not attend the video conference today as she was finding it difficult to cope with everything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 There is no reason, in my opinion, to transfer this matter to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The matter was listed for hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I am ready to hear the matter and the matter should proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I, therefore, decline as requested to transfer this matter to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There is no reason also, in my opinion, why I should disqualify myself either for actual bias or apprehended bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 The first time that I knew that there had been any threat, if there has been a threat directed to me, was when I read Ms Ogawa's letter on 15 May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I was not previously aware that the Queensland Police were investigating any threat made to or about me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is not appropriate for me to disqualify myself in those circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I need not disqualify myself because the applicant has brought to my attention the allegation that she has previously made a threat to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">As Mason J said in Re JRL; ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352:
 
 'Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have had their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">' 

7 I decline to disqualify myself for bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">8 The application for judicial review was listed for hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">There has been no appearance of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">As I have said, there is no contradictor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Order 32 rule 2(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules allows the Court to proceed in the absence of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In my opinion, it is appropriate that I proceed in this matter in the absence of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">My reasons for judgment will show that, in my opinion, this application on any understanding is doomed to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It therefore should be disposed of as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 On 9 September 2003 the applicant commenced proceedings against the University of Melbourne in the Queensland Registry of the Federal Court of Australia for damages for a contravention by the University of Melbourne of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (' Trade Practices Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The application was accompanied by a statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">10 On 19 September 2003 an amended statement of claim was filed pursuant to leave given by Kiefel J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On 25 November 2003 her Honour ordered that the matter be transferred to the Melbourne Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">On 17 December 2003 Weinberg J gave leave for the applicant to file a further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">On 4 May 2004 Marshall J ordered the proceedings be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 11 June 2004 Phipps FM gave leave to file yet a further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 On 27 July 2004 Phipps FM was called upon to consider two matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">First, an application by the applicant to transfer her proceeding to the Federal Court of Australia from which it had previously been transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Secondly, an application by the University of Melbourne to strike out or have summarily dismissed certain parts of the applicant's statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">12 On 27 July 2004 Phipps FM published ex tempore reasons for refusing to transfer the proceeding to the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In essence, his Honour refused the applicant's application on the ground that what was sought was to reagitate the matters which had been before Marshall J at the time that Marshall J, on his own motion, had transferred the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">13 The Federal Magistrate did not deal with the second application brought by the University of Melbourne on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 On 2 August 2004 the applicant sought leave of a judge of the Federal Court to appeal to the Federal Court from the order of Phipps FM refusing her application to transfer the proceeding to the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">15 On 10 August 2004 North J dismissed the applicant's application for a stay on the ground that the application for leave to appeal was hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">His Honour relied upon s 39(6) of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) (' Federal Magistrates Act ') which provides 'An appeal does not lie from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court in relation to the transfer of a proceeding under subsection (1)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Section 39(1) of the Federal Magistrates Act provides that 'if a proceeding is pending in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Magistrates Court may, by order, transfer the proceeding from the Federal Magistrates Court to the Federal Court or the Family Court'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">His Honour did not dismiss the application on the wider ground that an applicant cannot seek a stay of the applicant's own proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">16 On 23 August 2004 the applicant lodged an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia from the order of North J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">An amended application seeking special leave was lodged on 27 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">17 Because North J did not stay the proceeding on 5 August 2004, Phipps FM proceeded to hear the University of Melbourne's application originally listed before him on 27 July 2004 to strike out or to have summarily dismissed certain parts of the applicant's statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Federal Magistrate refused to summarily dismiss any part of the applicant's proceeding but did make an order striking out various paragraphs of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He gave leave to the applicant to file and serve a third further amended statement of claim within 28 days of that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">18 On 1 October 2004 three matters came before Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">First, the applicant's application for leave to appeal from the order of Phipps FM made on 27 July 2004 dismissing the applicant's application to transfer the matter to the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Secondly, a motion brought by the University of Melbourne seeking, amongst other things, an order that the applicant's application for leave to appeal be dismissed as incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Thirdly, a notice of motion dated 9 September 2004 brought by the applicant seeking leave to appeal from the order made by Phipps FM on 3 September 2004 striking out parts of the applicant's statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Of course, the second motion to which I have referred was a mirror image of the first so, in fact, there were two matters of substance before Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On that day Kenny J ordered that the application for leave to appeal from the orders made by Phipps FM on 27 July 2004 be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Secondly, she dismissed the applicant's second motion for leave to appeal against the order made by Phipps FM on 3 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">She ordered the applicant to pay the University of Melbourne's costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">19 On 11 November 2004 the applicant filed a further application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against Kenny J's refusal to grant leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Australia from the decision of Phipps FM made on 27 July 2004 refusing to transfer the proceeding from the Federal Magistrates Court to the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There are thus two applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court which have not yet been heard; the first from North J, and the second from Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">On 7 February 2004 the applicant applied in the High Court for an order for expedition of the hearing of her two applications for special leave to appeal but that application was dismissed by Gummow J on 11 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">20 There may be a further application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In his reasons for judgment to which I will refer, Ryan J has said that on 24 November 2004 the applicant applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal from the judgment of Kenny J published on 1 October 2004 relating to her order refusing to grant leave to appeal from the decision of Phipps FM regarding the pleadings in the substantive matter and sought an extension of time in which to make that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">If there be a third application for special leave that has also not been heard or determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">This application, however, does not relate to that third application if it exists in the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In addition to the two or perhaps three applications for special leave to appeal, the applicant has brought numerous applications for the issue of the constitutional writs in the High Court, all of which have been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">For the sake of completeness, I outline them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">21 On 23 September 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings in the High Court seeking an order for the issue of the constitutional writs and associated relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The respondents to that application were Marshall J, Phipps FM, North J and the University of Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The applicant sought orders setting aside the orders transferring the proceeding to the Federal Magistrates Court and the refusal to transfer them back to the Federal Court and the refusal of a stay of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The application was dismissed with costs by Hayne J on 13 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">22 On 26 October 2004 the applicant commenced proceedings in the High Court seeking an order nisi for the issue of the constitutional writs and associated relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">On this occasion the respondents were Marshall J, Phipps FM, North J, the University of Melbourne, Registrar Tim Connard and Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The applicant sought orders to compel the respondents to provide pro bono legal assistance; to quash the order of Marshall J of 4 May 2004 transferring the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court; to quash the decision of Phipps FM of 3 September 2004 not to retransfer the proceedings to the Federal Court; to quash the orders of North J of 11 August 2004 refusing to stay the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court; to quash the orders of Kenny J of 1 October 2004 refusing leave to appeal the decisions of Phipps FM; and to extend time in relation to the application for mandamus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">That application was dismissed with costs by Heydon J on 9 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">23 On 19 November 2004 the applicant commenced proceedings in the High Court seeking an order nisi for the issue of the constitutional writs and associated relief relating again to the order transferring proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court and for pro bono representation for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The respondents in that matter were Registrar Wood, Kiefel J, Dowsett J, Phipps FM, Kenny J and the University of Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">24 The applicant sought orders in the nature of mandamus to consider and determine by law the notice of motion filed on 10 August 2004 requiring pro bono counsel be appointed for the applicant; a writ of certiorari to quash the orders of Phipps FM and Kenny J made on 10 August 2004; a writ of prohibition directed to the Magistrate preventing him from further proceeding on orders made after 10 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">That application was heard with the previous application by Heydon J on 9 December 2004 and was also dismissed by his Honour on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">25 On 23 December 2004 the applicant filed an application in the High Court seeking leave to appeal from the judgment of Hayne J to which I have referred and an extension of time within which to make that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">On 22 June 2005 Gleeson CJ dismissed both applications with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">26 In an affidavit filed in the proceeding presently before me, the applicant deposes that on 5 January 2006 she presented to the Queensland District Registry of the Federal Court seven copies of the Appeal Books in relation to the two applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">27 She said on the same day she was informed by the Registrar of the High Court that 'she had decided not to file my Appeal Books because of their form'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The applicant has further deposed that on 31 March 2006 she tendered to the Court one of the seven copies of the Appeal Books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">She said:
 
 'I see no reason why the Appeal Book should be rejected and believe that they should have been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">' 

28 In the meantime the principal proceeding which was listed before Phipps FM came on for hearing on 8 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The applicant did not appear on that occasion and the respondent requested the Federal Magistrate to proceed with the matter pursuant to r 13.03A(d) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Federal Magistrate acceded to that request and made an order dismissing the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He published ex tempore reasons for his order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He adjourned the question of costs to 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">On that day he made a further order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs which he fixed at $58.000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">29 Subsequently, the applicant commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia seeking the same relief as had been the subject of the order of Phipps FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">On 22 August 2005 Ryan J made an order staying those proceedings and a further order requiring that the applicant obtain leave of a judge before filing and serving any application, motion or process against the University of Melbourne including any application or motion to discharge or vary the stay order made that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">30 On 4 April 2006 Finkelstein J heard a separate application brought by the applicant for judicial review of the decisions of Phipps FM made on 8 August and 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">On that day his Honour made the following orders:
 
 '(1) An order in the nature of a writ of certiorari issued to quash the decisions of the first respondent made on 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 (2) An order in the nature of a writ of prohibition issued prohibiting the second respondent from taking any further step in proceeding number MLG463 of 2004 while it remains in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
 (3) An order in the nature of a writ of mandamus issued requiring the first respondent to order the proceeding number MLG463 of 2004 be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 
 (4) That the parties bear their own costs of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">' 

31 His Honour was of the opinion that an error was made when the applicant's original proceeding was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is not necessary to examine his Honour's reasons except to say that he concluded that the original order should not have been made because the applicant's claim was said by the applicant to exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Magistrates Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain one aspect of the applicant's application being that part of the application made under s 51AB of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">32 The effect of his Honour's order was to require the Federal Magistrates Court to retransfer the matter to the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">That had been the order sought by the applicant on 27 July 2004 and refused by Phipps FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">On 21 April 2006 Phipps FM in conformity with his Honour's order made a further order:
 
 '(1) Pursuant to section 39 of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 this matter be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">' 

33 The principal proceeding has now been retransferred to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">That matter is listed before me for directions to follow immediately after the hearing of this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It is appropriate to deal with this matter, being the applicant's application for judicial review, before considering what directions ought to be made in the principal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">34 The application before me is for judicial review of the decision of the Registrar of the High Court to refuse to accept the Appeal Books tendered by the applicant in support of her application for special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The applicant now has succeeded, albeit in a roundabout way, of obtaining the orders she sought on 27 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The proceeding has been transferred to this Court and will now be heard in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">There is therefore no point, of course, in pursuing an application for a stay of the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court because the proceeding is no longer in that Court, nor is there any utility in pursuing an application for leave to appeal from the order of Phipps FM refusing to transfer the proceeding to this Court because the proceeding has now been transferred pursuant to an order made by Phipps FM in conformity with the order made by Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">35 In those circumstances, there is no longer any utility in the applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is inconceivable, having regard to the history set out above and having regard to the orders made by Finkelstein J and Phipps FM, that the High Court would grant the applicant special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The applicant has achieved the result by those recent orders to which I have just referred that she sought to obtain in her application for special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Her applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court are now otiose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">36 I therefore do not need to consider whether this application is maintainable under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) or the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 would apply if the Registrar's decision was a decision of an administrative character of the kind referred to in s 3 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">However, even if it were, I would not grant the relief sought because there is now no utility in considering whether or not the Registrar was right to refuse the applicant's tender of the Appeal Books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">37 Whether this application is brought under the Judiciary Act 1903 or the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 a grant of a remedy is discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The issue of the constitutional writs is always discretionary: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 and Re McBain; Ex parte Australian Catholic Bishops Conference and Another [2002] HCA 16 ; (2002) 209 CLR 372.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Any remedy under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 is also discretionary: s 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">38 It is appropriate, therefore, to dismiss this application for judicial review of the Registrar's decision to accept the tender of the Appeal Books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The order of the Court will be that the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Associate:
