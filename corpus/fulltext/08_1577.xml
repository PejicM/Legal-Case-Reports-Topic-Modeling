4 On 30 June 2008 the applicant, Mr Darley, filed and served an application for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the decision of Burnett FM of 14 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Accompanying the application was an affidavit deposed by the applicant and sworn on 30 June 2008.</sentence>

<sentence id="s26">At the directions hearing on 26 August 2008, despite numerous attempts, the Court officer could not contact the applicant on the mobile telephone number provided to the Court.</sentence>

<sentence id="s28">7 Included in the orders made on 26 August 2008 was an order that the matter be set down for hearing on 25 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Moreover, I also directed that the parties file and serve respective submissions and the applicant file and serve a draft notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A stamped copy of the orders of 26 August 2008 was posted to the applicant's postal address by the Federal Court Registry under cover of letter dated 1 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This letter also drew the applicant's attention to aspects of the orders that required his specific attention or action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">There is no suggestion that the applicant did not receive this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 On 12 September 2008 the Court informed both parties that the hearing date of 25 September 2008 was to be moved to 26 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">All orders made on 26 August 2008 remained unchanged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 The applicant did not comply with any of the orders of 26 August 2008.</sentence>

<sentence id="s46">On this occasion the applicant's phone was disconnected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">On that same day, the respondent's solicitors contacted the Court relating to the applicant's continuing non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">12 I understand that the respondent has attempted to contact the applicant on several other occasions by telephone, fax and postal address, but to no avail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">An affidavit filed in Court this morning by Mr Morgan gives evidence of the endeavours of the respondent to contact the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 At the hearing this morning at 10.15 am there was no appearance by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I asked the Court officer to call the matter outside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">There was no appearance by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I then asked the Court officer to contact the applicant on the mobile telephone number provided to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Court officer informed me that, upon calling the number, there was a Telstra message to the effect that the telephone number had been disconnected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">At this point the respondent requested that the application be dismissed for non-attendance, or otherwise pursuant to O 35A r 3(1) Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Consideration 
 
14 Orders on default are provided for under the O 35A Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Inter alia , this rule provides:
 2 When a party is in default 
 
 (1) For this Order, an applicant is in default if the applicant: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) fails to comply with an order of the Court in the proceeding; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) fails to attend a directions hearing; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) fails to file and serve a pleading as required by Order 11; or
 (d) fails to serve a list of documents on affidavit or other document, or does not produce a document as required by Order 15; or
 (e) fails to do any act required to be done by these Rules; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) fails to prosecute the proceedings with due diligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">... 
 
 
 3 Orders on default 
 
 (1) If an applicant is in default, the Court may order that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the proceeding be stayed or dismissed as to the whole or any part of the relief claimed by the applicant; or
 (b) a step in the proceeding be taken within the time limit in the order; or
 (c) the proceeding be stayed or dismissed, as to the whole or any part of the relief claimed by the applicant, if the applicant does not take a step ordered by the Court in the proceeding in the time limit in this order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 


 
15 In light of the failure of the applicant to:
 
&#8226; comply with the Court orders of 26 August 2008 and 25 September 2008; and
 
&#8226; appear at the hearing today without explanation,
 
I consider the application should be dismissed in accordance with O 35A r 3(1)(a) Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">I agree with the respondent's submissions that the applicant has failed to comply with an order of the Court pursuant to O 35A r 2(1)(a) Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I also consider the applicant has failed to prosecute this matter with due diligence pursuant to O 35A r 2(1)(f) Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">16 The respondent has also requested costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">17 As a general proposition, costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">However costs are usually awarded on a party to party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">18 In relation to indemnity costs, categories of cases warranting the Court in departing from the usual course of ordering costs on a party to party basis were described in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 as including:
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Making allegations of fraud knowing them to be false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The fact that proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or unlawful disregard of known facts or clearly established law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Any prudent refusal of an offer to compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">19 These principles, as articulated in Colgate-Palmolive , are well known and were recently reinforced by the Full Court of the Federal Court in InterTAN Inc v DSE (Holdings) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 54 at [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The categories of cases I have listed are not closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The Court clearly has wide discretion under s 43 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order costs in any particular matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In this particular case I am not persuaded that the circumstances of the case are such as to warrant a departure from the usual practice of the Court in awarding party to party costs so far as the costs of the respondent are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">There is no evidence before me that this case exhibits special or unusual features so as to justify the Court exercising its discretion so as to award indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Further, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to attend on numerous occasions there is no evidence before me that the applicant's case against the respondent was "hopeless" or had no chance of success, or that the applicant's case was not based on evidentiary or factual foundations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">20 Accordingly, in my view, the appropriate order is that the respondent is entitled to its costs on a party to party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Associate:

 Counsel for the Applicant: The Applicant did not appear 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: Mr NJ Morgan of Forbes Dowling
