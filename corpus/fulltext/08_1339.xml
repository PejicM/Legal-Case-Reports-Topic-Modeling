 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 20 August 2008 I made certain orders following a review of the decision and orders of a Deputy Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">These are my reasons for the making of those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 27 June 2008 the Deputy Registrar ordered that the defendant (the Company) be wound up and that Anthony Sims of Sims Partners be appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Deputy Registrar also ordered that the costs of the plaintiff (DCT --- I will also use the abbreviation "ATO" to refer to the Australian Taxation Office) be fixed at $1,256.70 and be reimbursed pursuant to s 566 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The Deputy Registrar noted by consent that the Company had not had the leave of the Court under s 490(1) of the Act when, on 19 May 2008, it had resolved to be wound up voluntarily and appointed the present applicant, Murray Roderick Godfrey (Mr Godfrey), as voluntary liquidator, and that his appointment as liquidator was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 The Deputy Registrar also ordered that Mr Godfrey's costs on an interlocutory process that he had filed on 27 June 2008 be fixed at $1,200.00 and be reimbursed next after the DCT's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">By that interlocutory process Mr Godfrey had sought:
 
&#8226; a declaration that a resolution of the Company's creditors passed on 29 May 2008 that the Company be wound up voluntarily and that he be appointed liquidator was invalid and consequently of no effect;
 
&#8226; that the Company be wound up by the Court; and
 
&#8226; that Mr Godfrey be appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 In the way in which the proceeding developed, the dispute to be resolved was whether Mr Sims or Mr Godfrey was to be liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 On 4 July 2008 Mr Godfrey filed a notice of motion seeking review by the Court of the Deputy Registrar's decision on 27 June 2008 to appoint Mr Sims and not to appoint him and an order that he (Mr Godfrey) be appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Having reviewed the Deputy Registrar's decision, by way of a hearing de novo, I have reached the same decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">FACTS 
 
7 Prior to its ceasing business, the Company operated as a general concreter doing residential, commercial and high rise work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">8 On 30 January 2008, an officer of the DCT posted a statutory demand by the DCT for $289,623.02 to the Company at its registered office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The statutory demand would have expired in late March 2008 but the DCT did not file the originating process which commenced this proceeding until 14 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">So far as the evidence reveals there was no communication between the ATO and the Company in the intervening period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">9 On 14 March 2008, an accountant in Wollongong named "Simone" telephoned Darren Vardy of RMG Partners, Mr Godfrey's firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">She said that she needed assistance in connection with a "Director Penalty Notice" issued by the ATO to her client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Later the same day, Mr Vardy had a telephone call from Ivano Cadorin who said that he was the director in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In fact, Mr Cadorin is the sole director, secretary and shareholder of the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Cadorin sent a copy of the penalty notice to Mr Vardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">After receipt of it, Mr Vardy spoke to "Simone" on 17 March 2008 and then on 20 March 2008 met with her and Mr Cadorin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">They told him that the Company had, in effect, ceased trading and had no work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They said that a new company was being established to look at new projects in the future, and that there was to be a transfer of assets from the Company to the new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Vardy states that he told them that a transfer would have to be at market value and that a sale agreement should be prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 There is in evidence a "deed of sale" dated 1 May 2008 by which the Company agreed to sell and a company called "NSW Concrete Contractors Pty Limited" agreed to purchase for a price of $22,000 the Company's business known as "Concrete Contractors".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The agreement provides that the whole of the purchase price of $22,000 was to be paid by instalments of $5,500 on 31 May 2008, $8,250 on 30 June 2008 and $8,250 on 31 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The deed of sale purports to have been signed by Mr Cadorin on behalf of both the Company as vendor and the new company as purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">11 It does not require great imagination to perceive the desirability of this transaction being investigated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In substance, the business has been continued by a company of an almost identical name under the control of the same person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">A liquidator of the Company, and through him the Company's creditors, are left with an entitlement to recover only $22,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">12 Mr Vardy said that on or about 6 May 2008, Mr Cadorin told him that he had been unsuccessful in refinancing, that the Company was to be placed into liquidation, and that the ATO was pursuing him (Mr Cadorin) personally pursuant to the Director Penalty Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">13 After receiving financial information from Mr Cadorin, Mr Vardy prepared papers in relation to the proposed voluntary liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">14 On or about 10 May 2008, Mr Vardy met with Mr Cadorin and provided him with documents to facilitate a voluntary liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Vardy gave evidence that he thinks he may have learned of the deed of sale at this meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He said that he did not know of it earlier than this and that he had no role in relation to the preparation of the deed of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">15 On 14 May 2008 the originating process in this proceeding was filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">and on 19 May 2008 a copy, together with other documents, was posted to the Company at its registered office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">16 On Thursday 15 May 2008, the DCT lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) a Form 519 (Notification of Application to Wind Up the Company in Insolvency under s 459P of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">17 On Monday 19 May 2008 a meeting of directors of the Company, that is to say Mr Cadorin, resolved that the Company was insolvent and unable to pay its debts as and when they fell due and should be wound up, and that the services of RMG Partners be requested to assist the Company in entering into a creditors' voluntary winding up and that Mr Godfrey be approached to accept nomination as liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">18 On the same day (Monday 19 May 2008) the Company's shareholders (again Mr Cadorin) passed a special resolution that the Company be wound up voluntarily and that Mr Godfrey be appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">19 Mr Godfrey states that on the day of the passing of the resolutions, Monday 19 May 2008, he caused a member of his staff, Laura Arnold, to conduct a free search of the records maintained by the ASIC in respect of the Company via a modem in his office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">He asserts that the result of the search did not reveal any application for the winding up of the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Mr Godfrey states: "I have not retained or have been unable to locate a copy of the results of that search".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It was also on Monday 19 May 2008 that a copy of the originating process together with other documents was posted to the Company at its registered office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">20 It is common ground that neither Mr Godfrey nor Mr Vardy inquired of the ATO or of the Court as to whether a winding up application had been launched.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">21 It was also common ground that it can take up to two business days for a Form 519 lodged with ASIC to show up on a search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Since the Form 519 in the present case was lodged on Thursday 15 May 2008, it is conceded that because of the intervening weekend, it may not have shown up on a search until some time on Monday 19 May 2008, possibly after Laura Arnold made her search of the ASIC records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">22 Mr Godfrey convened a meeting of the Company's creditors for 29 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The meeting took place at the offices of RMG Partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Summary of Affairs of the Company showed one asset, namely plant and equipment of $22,000, and creditors totalling $439,027.51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The ATO was shown as a creditor for $350,000, Mr Cadorin for $70,000, GIO Commercial Insurance for $13,527.51, and Accounting by Maynes Rutty for $5,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">On these figures the DCT represented 79.72 percent of the amount owing to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">23 On the motion of Mr Cadorin, it was carried on the voices that the appointment of Mr Godfrey as liquidator be ratified and that his remuneration up to a limit of $15,000 (including GST) be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Cadorin was the only creditor who attended, and he attended by telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Godfrey and a member of his staff were also "present".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">24 Mr Godfrey states that at the time of the creditors' meeting on 29 May 2008 he had no knowledge of the DCT's pending winding up application against the Company and that if he had known of it, he would not have accepted affirmation of his appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">25 On 2 June 2008 Mr Godfrey wrote to the ATO advising that on 19 May 2008 he had been appointed liquidator of the Company by a resolution of the shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">26 On 5 June 2008 the ATO wrote to Mr Godfrey advising that the Company was indebted to the ATO and that the amount claimed was $301,629.38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The letter enclosed a proof of debt in that sum and requested advice as to when a dividend was expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">27 On 11 June 2008, the ATO wrote to Mr Godfrey drawing his attention to the pending winding up application which had been commenced on 14 May 2008 and was returnable on Friday 13 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The letter advised that in view of Mr Godfrey's appointment the DCT would seek to have the application dismissed with an order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">28 By the time of the return date on 13 June 2008, it was appreciated by the ATO that s 490 of the Act had the effect that the Company had not been able to resolve that it be wound up voluntarily because the application for it to be wound up in insolvency had been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The originating process was filed on Wednesday 14 May 2008 and it will be recalled that the resolution that the Company be wound up voluntarily was passed on the following Monday 19 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">29 Accordingly, on 13 June 2008, Irene Chan of the ATO who appeared for the DCT caused the proceeding to be adjourned to Friday 27 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Ms Chan wrote to Mr Godfrey on 16 June 2008 a letter advising of the adjournment and noting that under s 490(a) of the Act, the appointment of Mr Godfrey as liquidator on 19 May 2008 had been invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">30 I noted at [2] above, the orders made by the Deputy Registrar on 27 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">31 On 4 July 2008, Mr Godfrey filed a notice of motion seeking review of the Deputy Registrar's decision of 27 June 2008, and on 10 July 2008 he filed an amended notice of motion seeking that relief but in the alternative an order pursuant to s 490 or in the alternative s 1322(4) of the Act, nunc pro tunc , granting leave for the Company to be wound up and for Mr Godfrey to be liquidator "pursuant to the resolution of (a) [t]he members of the [Company] on 19 May 2008; and (b) [t]he creditors of the [Company] on 29 May 2008".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">CONSIDERATION 
 
32 There is a course of authority according to which leave may be granted under s 490 of the Act nunc pro tunc , that is to say, as if the Court's leave had been granted before the passing of the special resolution by the company that it be wound up voluntarily: see, for example, Re Horsham Kyosan Engineering Co Ltd [1972] VR 403 ; Re Campbell's Corporation Ltd (1978) 3 ACLR 519 ; Re Akai Australia Pty Ltd (1978) 3 ACLR 353 at 356-357; Progress Printers &amp; Distributors Pty Ltd v Production &amp; Graphics Communication Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 689 ; 21 ACSR 241 ; 14 ACLC 1383 (Tamberlin J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In the Akai case, Powell J said that it is important for the Court to consider whether the creditors have taken into account the respective advantages of a winding up by the Court as opposed to a voluntary winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In the present case, the creditors have not considered that question and there can be no doubt how the votes would go if they did consider it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">33 In my view, Mr Sims should be liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">34 The view of the majority of unrelated unsecured creditors is entitled to considerable weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Company's debts, excluding the $70,000 said to be owed to Mr Cadorin, total $369,027.51 (see [22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Of this amount, the sum of $350,000 said to be owed to the ATO represents 94.84%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">35 On 17 March 2008 Mr Cadorin faxed to Mr Vardy a copy of the Director Penalty Notice and other documents including a copy of the statutory demand dated 30 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Accordingly, from 17 March 2008, Mr Vardy and, through him, Mr Godfrey, knew that the groundwork for the making of an application to the Court for a winding up in insolvency had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Yet neither of them pursued with Mr Cadorin the question whether the Company had been served with a winding up application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">36 The Company would have received the originating process shortly after 19 May 2008, admittedly after the passing of the members' resolution, but well before the holding of the creditors' meeting on 29 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">No doubt, if Mr Godfrey had known within a few days following 19 May 2008 that the originating process had been filed on 14 May 2008, he would have taken the appropriate steps at the meeting of creditors on 29 May 2008 to advise them that the resolution of 19 May 2008 had been invalid, and matters would not have proceeded any further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Indeed, Mr Godfrey said as much in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">CONCLUSION 
 
37 For the above reasons, the decision of the Deputy Registrar should not be disturbed, and the applicant, Mr Godfrey, should pay the DCT's costs of the review of her decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
