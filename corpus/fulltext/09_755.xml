<sentence id="s0">
 Yesterday I delivered reasons in this matter concluding that an order should be made under s 444F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) restraining the respondent from recovering possession of property occupied by the applicant, DNPW Pty Ltd (subject to DOCA) ACN 107 484 711 (DNPW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In my reasons at [136] I said that the respondent relied upon a decision Re Java 452 Pty Ltd (admin apptd); Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd (as trustee of Advance Property Fund) v Stout [1999] VSC 252 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 507 (incorrectly cited as Re Java 452 Pty Ltd (administrator appointed) (No 2) [1999] VSC 252 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 507).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I then discussed that decision concluding that the decision was not contrary to the construction which I put upon s 444F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Last night counsel for the respondent advised my chambers that I had referred to the first decision in Re Java rather than the second which was relied upon by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">This morning, junior counsel for the respondent advised me that they relied upon both decisions in Re Java.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I was told that whilst the respondent had referred to the second decision, the respondent had inadvertently given me a reference to the first decision, which is the decision to which my reasons refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Today an application has been made under O 35 r 7(1) of the Federal Court Rules to vary or set aside the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I do not think that such an application need be made because no order has yet been made under s 444F that needs to be recalled or revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">However, I should give further reasons in relation to the second decision in Re Java 452 Pty Ltd (Administrators Appted) (No 2); Stout &amp; Scales (in their capacity as joint administrators of Java 452 Pty Ltd (administrators appted) v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [1999] VSC 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In that decision, the company occupied premises owned by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondent had terminated the lease by notice given on 6 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The company entered into a Deed of Company Arrangement to sell the company's assets to a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The assets included the company's interest in the lease agreement which had been made between the predecessors of the company and the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Byrne J said (at [6]): 
 For the reasons set out at length in my judgment of 9 July I have concluded that the lease was terminated on 6 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This conclusion has a number of consequences for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">First, the Company cannot assign the lease to a purchaser of the business because the lease no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This means that the purpose of the Deed, namely the sale of the assets, is defeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Second, the Company will, upon the execution of the Deed, lose its statutory right to possession unless an order is made under s444F(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Such an order does not re-instate the lease or create a fresh lease which is capable of assignment to a purchaser of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I was told by counsel for the Company that his client would be prepared to enter into a fresh lease with Permanent Trustee in terms of the old lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This may be so, but Permanent Trustee says its (sic) does not want to grant such a term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It was not suggested that I have the power to compel it to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Moroever, the power conferred by s444F(6) to impose conditions upon the making of an order does not seem appropriate in a case where it is the respondent and not the applicant upon which the conditions might be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">

 With respect, I agree entirely with his Honour's observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">If a lease is terminated under an order under s 444F it does not reinstate the lease or create a fresh lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Indeed, I said as much in my reasons at [131] and [142].</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">That being the case, a company which has obtained the benefit of an order under s 444F cannot assign the lease because the lease has been terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The point of distinction in Re Java 452 Pty Ltd (Administrators Appted) (No 2); Stout &amp; Scales (in their capacity as joint administrators of Java 452 Pty Ltd (administrators appted) v Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [1999] VSC 273 is that the applicant in that case was purporting to enter into an agreement to sell a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However, because the lease had been terminated it was no longer an asset of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That is not the case in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">DNPW does not wish to sell or assign the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It wishes to continue to occupy the premises which were the subject of the Lease so that it can continue trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I do not think that either of the decisions in Re Java are inconsistent with my construction of s 444F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Associate:
