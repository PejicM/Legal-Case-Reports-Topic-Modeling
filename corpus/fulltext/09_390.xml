 INTRODUCTION 
 The Parties
 The applicant (Fig Tree) was formerly called Village Life Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Fig Tree has for some years provided management services in Australian retirement villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondent (Prime) owns retirement villages in several States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Fig Tree and Prime are both public companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Prime has appointed Fig Tree and others over the years to manage its facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This litigation relates to the management contracts for Prime's appointment of Fig Tree at 12 aged care facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The 12 facilities are in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Those facilities are Village Life Hackham 1 in South Australia, Village Life Hackham 2 in South Australia, Village Life Evanston (Gawler) in Evanston, South Australia, Village Life Elizabeth Vale at Elizabeth Vale in South Australia, Village Life Christie Downs located at Christie Downs in South Australia, Village Life Grafton located in Grafton, New South Wales, Village Life Townsville 1 and Townsville 2 at Wulguru and Thurangowa respectively in Queensland, Village Life Maryborough located in Maryborough, Queensland, Village Life Hervey Bay located in Scarness in Queensland, Village Life Gladstone in Gladstone, Queensland and Village Life Earlville located in Earlville, Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Dispute
 Early in 2007, for business reasons, Fig Tree decided to rationalise some of its contractual commitments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">As a result of that process, it pursued negotiations to assign the rights and obligations it then had in respect of a number of facilities, including Prime' s 12 retirement villages, to SCV Group Ltd (SCV).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The rights and obligations with Prime were set out in each instance in agreements known as Wholesale Management Services Agreements (WMSAs).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">As the evidence has unfolded, there has been a debate about the extent to which Fig Tree made known to Prime, or Prime otherwise discovered or knew of, the nature, extent and ramifications arising from the proposed assignments from Fig Tree to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Prime's case is that the assignment agreement and related conduct constituted a repudiation of Fig Tree's contractual obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Fig Tree, on the other hand, says that there has been no repudiation and stresses that the assignment was at all times conditional on Prime giving its consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Fig Tree also contends that although it was not in breach, Prime had sufficient information to elect whether or not to affirm its contracts under the WMSAs with Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Fig Tree says Prime did so affirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Prime denies this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On the affirmation plea, Prime's knowledge as to the detail of the terms and practical effect of the assignment has been of central importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Prime has not pleaded that Fig Tree deliberately withheld information or misled it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Any evidence as to information that Fig Tree held but did not pass onto Prime was not admissible as to Fig Tree's intent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It was, however, relevant to demonstrate Prime's lack of knowledge of some relevant facts concerning the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The essential disputed issues in the case come down to these: Did Fig Tree's proposed or actual assignment or any of its other related conduct (as pleaded) constitute a repudiation of the WMSAs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">If Fig Tree did repudiate the WMSAs or was otherwise in breach of the WMSAs, did Prime nevertheless affirm the ongoing continuation of those contracts by its conduct (as pleaded)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Depending on the answer to these questions, what is the appropriate relief, if any, for either party?</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Village Life Model
 The pleaded case involves examination of a model for the design and operation of retirement villages known as the 'Village Life' model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Village Life model was developed by Fig Tree prior to 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The content of the Village Life model is something that Fig Tree jealously guards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It maintains that it is the embodiment of a great deal of specialised experience and endeavour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Fig Tree contends, and Prime accepts, that aspects of the Village Life model are confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Village Life model involves physical design features as well as operating systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The operating systems are in turn described as the 'Village Life System'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The physical design contemplates separate accommodation units close to and linked by covered walkways to a communal facility; and then a communal dining facility serviced by a commercial scale kitchen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It contemplates only limited kitchen facilities in residents' individual units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A major element of the Village Life System is the quality and nature of delivery of food to residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Other fundamental elements of the Village Life System, according to Prime, were the remuneration and conditions of the on-site managers and the terms of residency enjoyed by the occupants of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In late 2005, Prime investigated an opportunity to acquire 12 of the villages then operated by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Prime says that Fig Tree's Village Life Model was a major factor in its decision to purchase the 12 villages and to enter into the WMSAs with Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This factor, however, is not a matter which arises on the pleadings in the sense of being related to any warranty, condition or representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As the case requires an objective assessment as to the significance of certain contractual terms, no weight can be given (on the pleaded case) to Prime's subjective reaction to the Village Life model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Wholesale Management Services Agreements
 Fig Tree entered into WMSAs with Prime at all 12 locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The WMSAs are all in substantially similar terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">(Some of the owners of aged care facilities with whom Fig Tree dealt were described as retail owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">However Prime was a 'Wholesale owner' and was described as such by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">) Relevantly to the case, each of the WMSAs: The termination provision in each instance provided that Prime 'may terminate this agreement by notice to [Fig Tree] at any time if the return to [Prime] reflects an occupancy rate of less than 50% for any continuous 6 month period'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Fig Tree would let the various tenancies comprising the village, charge rent; make certain payments to Prime and receive certain payments from Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It would account to Prime in a prescribed manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Restrictions were imposed on Prime's ability to dispose of or review its interest in a retirement village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">No express restriction was placed on Fig Tree but any assignment of a WMSA required the consent of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The WMSAs expressly adopted the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">That system was defined in part by '[Fig Tree's] operations and standards manual, as amended by it from time to time and any other manuals substituted by [Fig Tree] throughout the Term'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">CONFIDENTIAL EVIDENCE 
 The specific detail of the Village Life System has been by consent, the subject of orders for confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Those orders were made originally by Collier J on 28 November 2007 on an interlocutory basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The orders (with necessary variations), were renewed at trial by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">At the request of Fig Tree and with the consent of Prime, to the extent that the evidence touched upon the detail of the Village Life System, I was asked to close the Court to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">After hearing argument on that submission and on the basis of discussion referred to below I acceded to that course during such time only as there was evidence about the specific detail of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Sections 17 and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) relevantly read: 
 17(1) Except where, as authorized by this section or another law of the Commonwealth, the jurisdiction of the Court is exercised by a Judge sitting in Chambers, the jurisdiction of the Court shall be exercised in open court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">...
 17(4) The Court may order the exclusion of the public or of persons specified by the Court from a sitting of the Court where the Court is satisfied that the presence of the public or of those persons, as the case may be, would be contrary to the interests of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 Prohibition of publication of evidence etc .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
The Court may, at any time during or after the hearing of a proceeding in the Court, make such order forbidding or restricting the publication of particular evidence, or the name of a party or witness, as appears to the Court to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish and Others [1980] FCA 33 ; (1980) 29 ALR 228 Bowen CJ said at 232-234: 
 This court is a court established by statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It is clear from s 17(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 that, in general, it is obliged to exercise its jurisdiction in open court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This provision gives statutory force to the principle that justice must be administered publicly in open court and gives recognition to the weight of public interest which attaches to that principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

 
 However, s 17(4) and s 50 provide for encroachment upon that principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Under s 17(4) the public or some of the public may be excluded where the Court is satisfied their presence would be "contrary to the interests of justice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">We are all familiar with cases where this would be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Thus, it is common to exclude persons who are to give evidence, lest they be led to trim their evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Again, where demonstrators or rioters would disrupt the proceedings, it may be in the interests of justice to exclude them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The categories of cases where exclusion will be proper are not closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It will lie in the discretion of the judge, bearing in mind the injunction contained in s 17(1) and taking into consideration the interests of justice referred to in s 17(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">... 

 
 The importance of the principle of open justice is not in doubt (see Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 ; Russell v Russell [1976] HCA 23 ; (1976) 9 ALR 103 ; 134 CLR 495 , per Gibbs J at 520) nor is the need to depart from it in the interests of justice on occasion (see Attorney-General v Leveller Magazine Ltd [1979] 1 All ER 745 ; [1979] 2 WLR 247 , per Lord Diplock at 252; cf Halcon International Inc v Shell Transport and Trading Co [1979] RPC 97.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Cases which deal with the course a court should follow where there are no sections corresponding with ss 17 and 50 , although illuminating and helpful, are not decisive for a court constituted by an Act containing those sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Such a court has the slightly different task of interpreting and applying the statute which governs it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">

 
 Open justice is the underlying assumption of s 50 , not the criterion it prescribes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The section refers to preventing "prejudice to the administration of justice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This is not a reference to the need to preserve open justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is, as I have already suggested, a reference to another public interest, that is, the public interest that the Court should endeavour to achieve effectively the object for which it was appointed: to do justice between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">(emphasis added) 
 Although in these reasons I discuss in general terms the primary relevant features of the Village Life System, there were some 786 pages tendered which were said to be confidential documents constituting part of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There was also oral evidence about such aspects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The sense in which the material is said to be confidential may not be immediately apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Clearly some of it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However, I am satisfied that the request of the parties for me to continue the confidentiality orders originally made by Collier J was appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The material when taken in its entirety represents a system of operations which has clearly been developed with substantial care over a period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">To the extent that such intellectual property has afforded Fig Tree any market advantage or good will, such benefit may be at risk if the operational system were to be in the hands of a competitor by its being public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I was persuaded by the parties (and the evidence supported the conclusion) that aspects of the system were sufficiently unique such that access to the confidential elements of it by competitors could be substantially prejudicial to Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In a confidential annexure to these reasons (Appendix B), I have summarised and included in substantially greater detail than in the publicly available reasons, the confidential material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The confidential annexure, Appendix B will be available to Judges of this Court and otherwise, only on a limited basis in accordance with specific orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">THE PLEADINGS IN GREATER DETAIL 
 Each of the parties advances its own positive case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Case Pleaded for Fig Tree
 Fig Tree asserts that Prime was not entitled to treat its arrangements with SCV as constituting a repudiation of any of the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Fig Tree seeks to be retained as manager of the 12 villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In general terms, Fig Tree relies upon the terms of the Assignment Agreement of 30 May 2007, including conditions precedent by which the consent of Prime was to be obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It also relies upon its announcement of the Assignment Agreement to the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It relies upon the various steps taken in relation to giving effect to the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It asserts that Prime had the requisite knowledge of the ASX announcement and many other aspects of the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In support of that assertion, Fig Tree relies upon a detailed analysis of events to which I refer below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Fig Tree also refers to an exchange of correspondence between it and Prime in September and October of 2007 concluding with a letter from Prime to Fig Tree of 3 October 2007 in which Prime gave notice to Fig Tree that by: 
 purporting to assign its rights and by delivering management control and occupation of the villages to SCV Group, [Fig Tree] has repudiated each WMSA [and Prime] accepts [Fig Tree's] repudiation and hereby gives notice that each WMSA is therefore terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">(emphasis added) 
 Fig Tree says that Prime was not entitled to terminate the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It says on the proper construction of those agreements, Fig Tree was entitled to discharge its obligations under them by servants or agents or by subcontractors or delegates including SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It also says that on their proper construction the WMSAs entitled Fig Tree to assign its rights and benefits under them without obtaining Prime's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In any event, on proper construction of the Assignment Agreement, Fig Tree contends that it had not purported to assign its right, powers and responsibilities without first obtaining the consent of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In the alternative, Fig Tree argues that Prime, by reason of its knowledge of and participation in a range of activities connected with the assignment, has affirmed the WMSAs even if there was any breach of them which would have otherwise entitled Prime to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It seeks consequential relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The Case Pleaded for Prime
 Prime cross-claims and contends it was entitled to terminate the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It advances that claim on the following contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Prime says that Fig Tree was not able to assign its performance obligations under the WMSAs without first obtaining Prime's consent which was not and never has been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It says that Fig Tree by entering into the agreement repudiated the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It says that Fig Tree in fact and in substance purported to assign its performance obligations to SCV and, by that conduct, repudiated the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Prime says that Fig Tree, whether by an effective assignment or by the actual fact of installing SCV as an agent manager or both, repudiated the WMSAs as Fig Tree ceased to perform all or substantially all of the management functions in the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Further, Prime says that Fig Tree implemented new permanent arrangements inconsistent with the Village Life System in relation to food provided to residents, in the manner in which food was prepared and served, in the terms of engagement of on-site managers and in the conditions of tenancy for residents at the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">By these acts Prime asserts that Fig Tree manifested an intention no longer to perform its obligations under each of the WMSAs or, at least, not in accordance with all the terms of the WMSAs and, in particular, in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Prime also says that none of its conduct could amount to an affirmation of the WMSAs so as to have disentitled it to rely upon any of Fig Tree's repudiatory conduct to justify Prime's termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In particular, Prime points to the fact that it did not have sufficient relevant knowledge in order to have affirmed nor did it ever communicate that it had affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Finally, Prime says that in the alternative if Fig Tree is held not to have repudiated the WMSAs and is further to be entitled to remain at the villages as manager, the conduct of Fig Tree is such that it should be required by an order for specific performance to meet its obligation to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In summary, Prime says that the nature and impact of the changes introduced during the period of SCV's management were significant and in relation to the areas discussed above, they showed, first, in connection with food: on-site managers being required to buy pre-cooked frozen meals from a single supplier rather than to prepare freshly cooked meals on-site; communal eating areas being closed for evening meals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Residents were required to collect frozen meal packs at lunchtime for reheating privately in the units each evening; there was no protocol to ensure the residents stored or reheated their food packs in a safe manner; SCV did not set minimum nutritional requirements nor did it confirm whether the meals provided to residents met the nutritional requirements previously set by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Terms of Engagement of Managers
 Features of the Village Life System which were also of importance according to Prime related to the remuneration and conditions of the on-site managers, namely: In relation to the terms and conditions of managers on-site, Prime says that SCV: required on-site managers to enter employment agreements with SCV, not with Fig Tree; capped the hours of work for which those managers were paid and did not provide any incentive by way of a payment based on the occupancy of the villages; required on-site managers to pay rent for their on-site accommodation; and did not require managers to follow and did not provide training to new managers in the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Terms of Residency
 The final aspect of the Village Life System, which Prime emphasises, related to the terms of residence in the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Those features being: As to the third area, namely, the terms of the residential agreements with residents, Prime says that SCV: On those pleadings, these reasons necessarily examine a comparison of services under SCV with services under Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It must be emphasised that SCV is not a party to this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Any comparison of the nature of the services arises only in the context of determining whether the services supplied by SCV were the same as or similar to those which Fig Tree was contractually obliged to supply to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">EVENTS OF 2007 
 The Documents
 In terms of viewing the overall events of the relevant period, focus on the content of contemporaneous documents has assumed importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Such documents have not, it seems, been created with an eye to the pleaded issues that arise in the case but rather to the actual events as they were occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">A key date is 30 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">On that date Fig Tree and SCV entered into the Assignment Agreement under which Fig Tree agreed either to assign or to transfer to SCV its rights under each of the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The essential operative provision of the Assignment Agreement was cl 3 which relevantly provided that Fig Tree agreed to assign or transfer and SCV agreed to take the assignment or transfer of what was described as each of the 'Remaining Assets'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">These Remaining Assets were Fig Tree's rights and benefits under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">There were conditions precedent expressed in the agreement (set out below) that completion of the assignment or transfer was conditional on Prime's consent being obtained either to assignment or to novation with new agreements being entered into as between Prime and SCV on terms substantially similar to the WMSA terms: CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 
 
 2.1 Completion is conditional upon the following:
 ...
 (e) in respect of a Wholesale Complex: 

(i) the Purchaser being satisfied (acting reasonably) that, if the Wholesale Management Rights Agreement relating to that Wholesale Complex is a Nominated Wholesale Management Agreement, the ambiguous provision contained in that agreement has been addressed in accordance with clause 5.1(b); and
 
(ii) the parties obtaining any necessary consent or approval of a third party to the assignment or novation of the Wholesale Management Rights Agreement for that Wholesale Complex to the Purchaser with effect from the Completion Date; and
 
(iii) the parties generally obtaining all other statutory consents and approvals that may be reasonably required to give effect to this agreement or the transactions contemplated by this agreement; and
 
(iv) the parties generally obtaining all other third party consents and approvals that may be reasonably required to give effect to this agreement; and
 
(v) in respect in the Wholesale Management Rights Agreements: 
 
(A) each of the Wholesale Management Services Agreements for the Wholesale Complex is amended or varied so as to comply with all regulatory and statutory requirements and the consent of the other party to the Wholesale Management Services Agreements to the assignment or novation of the Wholesale Management Services Agreements is obtained; or 
 
(B) the parties agreeing with the owner of the Wholesale Complex to: 
 
(1) terminate the Wholesale Management Rights Agreement for that Wholesale Complex; and 
 
(2) the Purchaser entering into a new contract with the owners of that Wholesale Complex on terms either substantially similar to the terms of the Wholesale Management Rights Agreement for that Wholesale Complex or otherwise on terms acceptable to the Purchaser acting reasonably and the parties obtaining any necessary consents or approvals of a third party financier to the entry into that new contract; and
 
 ... (emphasis added) 
 The Assignment Agreement also provided for a 'Transition Period' which was to commence on 1 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Fig Tree appointed SCV during the Transition Period to provide operational services as an independent contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">SCV was to receive payment by Fig Tree of all fees that Fig Tree was entitled to collect pursuant to the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Fig Tree stresses that in addition to the structure of the conditions precedent to the assignment, the nature of the Transition Period provided for (by cl 6 of the Assignment Agreement) meant that there was no assignment to SCV of Fig Tree's rights under the WMSAs during the Transition Period and before completion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Fig Tree agreed to pay SCV fees it obtained under the WMSAs as distinct from assigning or purporting to assign to SCV Fig Tree's own right to collect the fees from Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Both prior to and subsequent to execution of the Assignment Agreement of 30 May 2007, events are described in contemporaneous documents to which Fig Tree (predominantly) has referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Fig Tree contends these events demonstrate Prime's sufficient awareness of and communication about the Assignment Agreement and the events surrounding it so as to constitute an affirmation of the WMSAs even if there were any breach of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The first event to which Fig Tree points precedes the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It is the establishment of the Prime Trust Due Diligence Committee (DDC) in respect of which there are minutes of 14 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The DDC included Prime Directors, Messrs Wooldridge and Lewski and its company secretary, Mr Krishnan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The DDC was formed to undertake the preparation of a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) and for related activities in respect of the potential listing of Prime Trust Units on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">These minutes establish the constitution of the DDC and refer to the solicitors engaged to prepare the material contracts section of the PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">As will be seen in the ultimate edition of the PDS produced on 6 July 2007, that document records that each of the then directors of Prime agreed with the contents of the PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The PDS discusses the assignment to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">On 28 February 2007, Fig Tree published its half yearly financial reports for the year ended 31 December 2006 to the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The directors reported that after careful consideration of the company's financial position, the board had resolved to assign its management agreements with its retail, syndicate and ILF Villages, to SunnyCove for a cash consideration of $14 million subject to shareholder approval and other relevant consents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">(SunnyCove was another name by which SCV was known).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The report also refers to entry into a heads of agreement with SCV on 27 February 2007, to assign the management agreements between Village Life and the owners of the retail syndicate and ILF Villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Again, it referred to consents and approvals being obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Fig Tree makes the point that this was a public announcement and a potential source of knowledge which Prime could have had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">There is no evidence that Prime was aware of these particular passages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">On 14 March 2007, Fig Tree made an ASX announcement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Fig Tree had called the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders to consider the proposed assignment to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It would be held on 24 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Again, this was a public announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Again, there was no evidence that Prime was aware of it at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">On 20 March 2007 the notice of the EGM with an explanatory statement was published on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Again, this was a public announcement but there was no evidence of Prime's awareness of its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">On 2 April 2007 an early draft of the Prime Trust PDS was prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In that draft there is a reference to Village Life as one of the entities associated with Prime and while there was no mention of SCV, that position was to change shortly after that draft was prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">On 16 April 2007, a further draft of the Prime PDS was prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It included the first version of what eventually appears in section 6.3 of the final PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The extract at that time read: 
 6.3 SCV Managed Properties 

 
 A number of Properties are managed by SCV Group Ltd under a 25 year Wholesale Management Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">This Agreement was initially entered into (sic-with) Village Life Ltd, but in April 2007, the shareholders of Village Life approved the sale of these Management Agreement to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">

 
 SCV is a listed (sic) on the ASX and specialises in the management of retirement and aged care facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">There is no ownership relationship between Prime Trust (and APCH) and SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">

 
 Prime Trust is entitled to the rent charged to each resident at each facility less a per unit management fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The rent charged to residents is the aggregate of a percentage of the Commonwealth government aged pension and 100% of the Commonwealth government rent assistance to pensioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">

 
 The management fee received by SCV enables them to provide full food and resident services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">
 Fig Tree contends and I accept that this PDS demonstrates that the draft person prepared that content in anticipation that Fig Tree (then known as Village Life) would enter into an agreement with SCV such that SCV would replace Fig Tree in relation to the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It is also contended that the draft person of the PDS anticipated that the properties would be managed by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That is also a reasonable inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">(The draft person was not called to give evidence).</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">At this stage the EGM of Fig Tree had not yet been held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It may be inferred that the draft person of the early edition of the PDS was anticipating the outcome of the EGM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">On 20 April 2007, there was a further meeting of Prime's DDC, the minutes of which suggest that drafts of the PDS were being circulated to members of the DDC for their perusal and comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">I will not refer to every draft of the PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that the content of the final PDS was certainly available for the members of the Committee and Prime's directors to examine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Of course whether in fact they did absorb every word of it is another question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">On 24 April 2007, Fig Tree published an announcement to the ASX confirming approval by shareholders at the EGM in relation to the assignment to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">There is no evidence that Prime was aware of the actual announcement, but again, this is not of major importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">On 26 April 2007 there was an addition to the relevant section of the PDS in the following terms: 'Prime Trust can terminate the agreement if the return reflects an occupancy rate of less than 50% for any continuous 6 month period'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">There was further reference to the properties being managed by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">There was an email exchange between the personal assistant of Mr Mark Roberts of SCV at 4.54 pm on 26 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It purports to record the content of a phone message which Mr Roberts had received from Mr Kim Jaques of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It advised that Mr Jaques had phoned: 
 and advises that they have 14 villages and is very keen to speak/meet with Mark regarding ideas moving forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Kim is on the Sunshine Coast until Saturday and would make himself available to meet with Mark up to 7.00 pm on Friday night... 
 There was then an email exchange between Mr Jaques of Prime and Mr Roberts of SCV later in the evening in which Mr Jaques adverts to making arrangements for Mr Lewski (of Prime) and Mr Roberts (of SCV) to meet, saying 'I look forward to seeing you at SunnyCove's HO in Maroochydore'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Fig Tree contends and I accept, this is objective proof of high level contact between Prime and SCV in April 2007 regarding the plans to meet to discuss 'ideas moving forward'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">On 14 May 2007 the PDS again referred to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">There was an amendment to the section dealing with properties operated by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">These amendments referred to the Transition Period relating to the formal transfer of the agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">There is no direct evidence as to how Prime knew of the Transition Period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Fig Tree suggests that one possibility is the contact between Mr Jaques and Mr Roberts referred to in the email exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Neither person gave evidence as to whether such a meeting took place and if so, what was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">There was an announcement by Fig Tree to the ASX 29 May 2007 confirming that on 28 February 2007 Fig Tree had announced entry into the heads of agreement with SCV to assign its management rights in all the relevant Village Life villages conditional on certain approvals being obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It recorded that the date for satisfaction of those conditions expired on 28 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It also recorded that Fig Tree had agreed with SCV to extend the date for satisfaction of the conditions until 31 May 2007 with a view to agreeing the final form of the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">There is no evidence that Prime was aware of this announcement or its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Two days later, on 31 May 2007, Fig Tree made a further announcement to the ASX confirming entry into a formal Assignment Agreement with SCV in relation to the assignment of the management rights in all of the Fig Tree villages for $14 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It also referred to several conditions precedent and a phased settlement program to occur progressively over the next three to six months as conditions relating to villages were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Prime did know of this public announcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Prime contends, however and I accept, that the information in the public announcement was certainly not sufficient to require it to elect whether or not to affirm or terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">On a more practical note, however, in email exchanges between 6 and 12 June 2007 the personal assistant for Mr Lewski of Prime emailed Mr Roberts, Managing Director of SCV following an earlier telephone conversation seeking a copy of the Village Life Operations and Standards manual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">What was specifically sought was that part of the Village Life manual identifying the 'Management Services' which Fig Tree agreed to provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Mr Lewski's personal assistant concluded in the final email in this exchange by advising that the inquiry for the relevant sections of the Operations manual was urgent and indicated that if the relevant sections of the manual were not provided, Prime would instruct its lawyers to attend Fig Tree's offices to view it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">On 7 June 2007, Mr Darryl Watherston of Fig Tree emailed Mr Roberts of SCV advising that 'no information is being sent out due to a legal determination that the [Fig Tree] brochures misrepresent the current services provided'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In other words, the information that the Fig Tree brochures described about the retirement villages did not reflect the services actually being provided by SCV at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">There is no reason to infer that Prime was aware of the decision to withhold brochures or the reason for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">On 12 June 2007, Mr Stuart Lummis, an executive of Fig Tree emailed Mr Lonie of Fig Tree concerning the Vacating Unit Advices saying that as discussed with him last week 'SCV are destroying our business'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">This information also, was not conveyed to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Prime points to the fact that it was unaware that there was a view within Fig Tree to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Prime argues that this information would be particularly relevant to the question of whether it had sufficient information in order to affirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On 12 and 15 June 2007 two of Prime's Directors (Messrs Jaques and Butler) exchanged emails on the broad topic of the ability to assign property and the need for consents and opportunities which might arise from that process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Fig Tree suggests that this exchange illustrates that Prime was conscious of a potential for commercial advantage arising in the context of its consent to assignment being sought and obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">An example of this advantage is indicated 3 days later in communications on an insurance premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">There was a further draft of the PDS on 15 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">It included at section 6.3 which is headed 'Properties Operated by SCV Group', an amendment to delete the reference to the Transition Period referred to in the 14 May 2007 draft and to record the fact of the public announcement made on 31 May 2007 of the commencement of operational management of the villages by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">There was also now in this draft of the PDS a reasonably extensive summary of the obligations of SCV under the management agreements at the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Again, in the context of termination, there was reference to Prime having the power to terminate if the occupancy rate fell below 50% for a continuous period of 6 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">No other basis for termination is indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Yet a further draft of the PDS was circulated three days later without significant changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">There was an exchange of emails on 18 and 19 June 2007 between Mr Jaques of Prime and Mr Roberts of SCV in which Mr Jaques raised the question of a collaboration between Prime and SCV in order to obtain a better insurance premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Reference is made to having raised the issue previously with Fig Tree but without any satisfactory outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Fig Tree stresses that this exchange not only shows that Prime knew SCV was replacing Fig Tree but that Prime was seeking to obtain a commercial advantage (rather than a detriment) consequent upon that exchange occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">While this submission may be correct, it is peripheral to the pleaded issues insofar as the practical impact of the proposed assignment is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">On 21 June 2007, Fig Tree's Managing Director reported to the Board of Management 'it is now likely that SCV will transition the business processes to Maroochydore by the end of July 2007, which will see the end of the business office operations apart from a skeleton team'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Prime was unaware of and had not been informed of such a plan or the subsequent implementation of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">On 26 June 2007 Prime held its final DDC meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Consent letters by each of the then directors of Prime concerning the content of the PDS were tabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Fig Tree contend that the totality of the numerous drafts and the final version of the DDC's PDS lead to the conclusion that Prime through its directors and company secretary knew that Fig Tree had entered into the Assignment Agreement with SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Those persons knew that the effect of the agreement, so far as Prime was concerned, was that Fig Tree was replaced by SCV in relation to the performance of the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Fig Tree also contends that it should be inferred that Prime was prepared to accept such a replacement as a satisfactory status quo regardless of formalities and that the status quo was sufficiently certain to warrant Prime taking the step of telling the market about it in its own PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Importantly, Fig Tree contends, it shows that Prime knew that SCV had commenced operational management of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">I accept these submissions subject to the reservation that clearly Prime was not accepting that SCV could operate as it saw fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">On this critical topic I note that Fig Tree has not adduced any evidence as to how it intended to and did ensure that SCV would provide the very important food service in a manner which conformed with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">There is no evidence that it did do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Rather, as will be seen, it simply left things to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The 25 June 2007 minutes of a Fig Tree Board meeting confirmed that it was agreed that as Fig Tree had 'assigned its management rights to the SCV Group Limited for a consideration of $14 million, it was now appropriate that the Directors compensation and fees be restored as was previously anticipated'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Prime says it was unaware at the time of any of these facts or that Fig Tree's financial constraints were a driving factor behind the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The underlying suggestion in this and related submissions is that there was an anxiety within Fig Tree to divest itself of the obligations under the WMSAs sooner rather than later with a view to becoming sufficiently liquid to enable 'Directors compensation and fees' to be 'restored as was previously anticipated'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">On the day following the final PDS, 27 June 2007, Mr Roberts received an email from his personal assistant conveying a telephone message from Prime's company secretary, Mr Krishnan concerning changes in reporting and management requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">It is said to be a precursor for a 30 July 2007 SCV letter to Mr Jaques of Prime which identified changes in management requirements and also the eventual transmission on 10 August 2007 of the July audit reports which formed the background to a meeting on 15 August 2007 with SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Fig Tree says these communications when taken together, fully informed Prime of all information it would need to enable it to elect whether or not to affirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">As will become evident, I disagree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">I do not accept that this information put Prime on notice as to the practical effect in the villages of the proposed assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">On 3 July 2007 there was an email from Mr Lonie, Managing Director of Fig Tree to Mr Dubery of Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It concerned the transition timetable (which had commenced on 1 July 2007) saying ' our only ambition now is to collect the $14 m ASAP and get away from SCV ' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Prime would say that this email highlighted what, at least at that stage, was Fig Tree's 'only ambition' --- 'to collect the $14 m ASAP and get away from SCV'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Prime says this was a very significant factor unknown to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I was not specifically addressed on whether it was appropriate to attribute this content to an objective assessment of the conduct of Fig Tree in relation to the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It would be a significant step to accept this content alone as evidencing a renunciation by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">But it is, nevertheless, consistent with the absence of any effective steps on the part of Fig Tree to ensure that SCV delivered the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">There were two communications by Fig Tree of some importance on 13 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">First, Fig Tree announced to the ASX as follows: 
 As noted in Village Life's announcement of 31 May 2007 relating to the assignment of the management rights of Village Life villages to SCV Group Limited, Village Life is currently endeavouring to obtain all necessary approvals to satisfy the conditions precedent under the Assignment Agreement with SCV .</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">

 
 In particular, this involves obtaining the consent of the owners of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">ING Management Limited as responsible entity of the ING Real Estate Community Living Fund, the owner of 33 villages managed by Village Life, has already consented to the assignment of the management rights over those villages to SCV and completion of that assignment is anticipated to take place within approximately three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Village Life is in the process of seeking the consents of the owners of all other Village Life villages and completion of the assignment of the management rights of those villages will occur progressively as consents are obtained and conditions precedent relating to each village are satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">(emphasis added) 

 Secondly, a letter was sent from Fig Tree's Managing Director, Mr Lonie to Prime in the following terms: 
 As you are aware, due to Village Life's well documented challenges, it entered into an agreement with SCV Group Limited to assign the management rights in the Village Life property that you own to SCV Group Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">

 
 As part of those arrangements, Village Life agreed with SCV Group Limited that it was in the best interests of the property owner and SCV Group Limited that the parties enter into a replacement agreement between the owner and SCV Group Limited, so that the relationship is direct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">

 
 In so doing, Village Life and SCV Group Limited agreed that there could be no change to any term or condition of the current contract that each owner enjoys with Village Life, except to the extent necessary to comply with the current legislative requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">We will point out any such change to you in the information that will be provided to you with the new documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">

 
 We also thought it appropriate that SCV Group Limited's credentials as a competent manager of villages are also conveyed to you for your information, which will also be included in the information package that will be sent to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">

 
 As you may appreciate, it has taken some time to have new documents prepared and we apologise for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">We anticipate that they will be dispatched to your (sic-you) in the next week so please look out for them and, if you have any query, please do not hesitate to call the telephone number that will be provided to you to answer any question that you may have in regard to these new documents in the package.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">

 
 Please look out for and action the new documents when you receive them and again let me reiterate that you should not hesitate to call if you have any query.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">(emphasis added) 
 Prime accepts this letter was sent but 'cannot admit that it was definitely received'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">There does not appear to be any serious argument advanced as to non-receipt of the letter or any reason for non-receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Fig Tree places a deal of emphasis on the two invitations in the letter to raise any queries which Prime might have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Fig Tree contends that it could hardly be that an objective third party could conclude renunciation by Fig Tree either of the contract as a whole or of a fundamental obligation under it unless the party had contacted Fig Tree to ascertain what its intentions actually were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">However, the ultimate essential complaint of Prime relates to what was actually occurring at the villages as it eventually became known to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Prime says it did not become aware of the significant practical ramifications of the changes arising from SCV assuming management until much later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">In contrast and as an indication of Fig Tree's knowledge of such changes (which were unknown to Prime), on 20 July 2007, Fig Tree's Managing Director's report to the Board of Management included the following very accurate prediction: 
 The key argument will be that, as the SCV system that we have let them introduce, is not identical to the VLL system, there is a fundamental failure to deliver the prescribed outcomes in accordance with the original management contract .</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">

 
 We will now write to all remaining staff who will not stay with Village Life beyond the SCV handover process that they will be made redundant at the end of August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">(emphasis added) 
 On 24 July 2007 in a Fig Tree Board meeting, the redundancy of Fig Tree personnel on 24 August 2007 was noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">No details concerning the villages were set out as they had been taken over by SCV at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">On 25 July 2007 in an email from Mr Dubery to Mr Buckner each of Fig Tree, Mr Dubery confirmed that Fig Tree had given notice to its remaining staff of the termination of their employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Prime says that it was unaware of the 'key argument' view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">It was also unaware of the redundancy of staff either being proposed or when it eventuated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">On 30 July 2007, the Managing Director of SCV, Mr Roberts wrote to Mr Jaques at Prime confirming that Prime would be receiving from Fig Tree shortly, information regarding the legal documentation relating to the assignment of the management rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">He also indicated that as part of the transition and pending issue of the legal documentation to the owners, it was agreed between Fig Tree and SCV that SCV would commence the transition of the management of the Fig Tree portfolio from 1 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The Managing Director also informed Mr Jaques that the staging of that transition allowed for the administration and rent collections to be still undertaken by Fig Tree with SCV commencing management operations in the day to day activities at community level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In this communication under the heading 'Key Objectives Transitional and Operational Requirements' there was a reference to audit reports being finalised over the next fortnight and becoming available to investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">There was also reference to the business model of SCV supporting direct employees as opposed to independent contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Under the heading 'Human Resources and Training' there was reference to Fig Tree independent contractors being provided 90 day contracts with SCV on the same terms and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">In the same lengthy letter, under the heading 'Catering Service' which has assumed substantial significance in these proceedings, the following passage appeared: 
 Over the past two months there have been several press articles which have been critical about our proposed food service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The SCV Group have over the years trialed numerous methods of delivering food to the residents which have ranged from cooked fresh to cook chill systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">SCV have found that the best method of ensuring consistency and quality over a wide geographic area is the cook freeze method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">

 
 The media and other misinformation have taken this to mean that residents will be receiving frozen packs of food and the residents will not receive any fresh food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">This is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">

 
 A meal is always made up of various components and there will be some components that will arrive at the community frozen and will need to be cooked on site or reheated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">This provides consistency in the food and quality across communities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The frozen components are only those of protein and no different to what you may prepare at home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">

 
 The food is still plated at the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Suppliers of the food are all HACCP and ANZFS compliant and comply with all state requirements and utilise nutritionists and dieticians in consultation with the SCV Group Catering Manager to assist in the formulation of recipes and menu's (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The benefit of the SCV catering service and system is the Residents can be offered two choices for lunch, up to five choices for the evening meal and can meet residents special dietary needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">

 
 The benefit to the community manager is reduced food preparation time of a minimum ten hours per week and a minimum three hours per week reduction in external food purchasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The benefit to the resident is the consistency of the catering service and the benefit investor (sic) higher resident retention and higher occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">
 I do note that Mr Jaques was not called by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">I am pressed by Fig Tree to draw an inference that Mr Jaques' evidence on this topic would not have been of assistance to Prime's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">In my view this raises a question of onus on the affirmation issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I will revert to that issue in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">On 30 and 31 July 2007 there was an exchange of emails between the personal assistant to SCV's Managing Director and the personal assistant to Prime's Managing Director advising that Mr Roberts had been speaking with Mr Jaques and they had requested that a meeting be arranged: 'Could you please liaise with Kim and advise availability for tentative appointment time of Monday, 6 th August 2007 at 2.30 pm in your office (level 2, 613 St Kilda Road, Melbourne, VIC, 3004)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">In a response confirming the meeting it was stated that the Managing Director of Prime, Mr Lewski would also attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">While there is no direct evidence of the meeting of 6 August 2007, Fig Tree suggests that surrounding evidence including emails on 7 and 10 August 2007 suggests that the meeting occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">On 7 August 2007 there was an email from Mr Roberts of SCV to Mr Jaques of Prime confirming arrangements for the meeting with SCV's operations and marketing team on 15 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">It indicated that he looks forward to 'meeting again'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">On 10 August 2007 there were three emails from Mr Roberts of SCV to Mr Lewski and Mr Jaques of Prime (via their personal assistants) referring to a previous meeting and a request for clarification of investor income and expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Fig Tree contends that when these communications are read together with the July Community Summary Reports, there is a strong basis for the conclusion that prior to the meeting on 15 August 2007, Prime by at least Mr Jaques and Mr Lewski knew: Fig Tree also relies on the fact that Mr Lewski accepted in cross-examination that he became aware of this proposition at about the time he received the reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Fig Tree says it is clear, taking these written communications together, that SCV had told Prime that SCV was intending to implement the cook freeze method which was described in its 30 July 2007 letter referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It is also clear, according to Fig Tree, that SCV informed Prime that SCV proposed a maintenance and refurbishment program and also intended to implement a system for national suppliers which would involve transfer and termination of the supplier and service provider contracts with a transfer of those contracts over to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Again, Mr Lewski accepted that he was aware of this information at the time he received the reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Mr Lewski also confirmed that at the time he received the reports he was aware that SCV had proposed changes in the way in which the community managers would be employed including that they be employed by signing a new contract and also that SCV had issued 90 day transitional contracts in many cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In an email exchange on 10 August 2007 between Mr Roberts of SCV and Mr Jaques of Prime and Mr Lewski via his personal assistant, reference is made to the 'previous meeting'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The suggestion is that the 6 August 2007 meeting which had been proposed did in fact take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">I accept that there can be little doubt that by mid-August Prime was receiving a deal of information of a practical nature concerning management issues which it now contends were of significant importance to the question of whether it had sufficient information to elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">There are further questions, however, of whether it had sufficient information of the practical ramifications of proposed changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">In this regard Prime, in contrast to Fig Tree, points to the significant practical information that it did not have until September or October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">On the day preceding the above communication (9 August 2007) in an email between SCV and Mr Jaques of Prime, SCV requested approval for expenditure on a replacement clothes dryer for Elizabeth Vale 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Mr Jaques raised a question concerning the expenditure and gave a direction in relation to a replacement machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">On 13 August 2007 there was a similar communication concerning taps sets; and also a similar communication on 14 August 2007 concerning hot water systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">These communications support conduct consistent with constituting affirmation according to Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">There was also a significant report dated 15 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Investor reports for the month of August 2007 were prepared on Village Life letterheads but signed by SCV 'managing on behalf of Village Life Ltd'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">In those reports, two pages concerning the villages at Hackham 1 and Hackham 2 expressly referred to poor press over recent times due to troublesome residents attempting to create issues with 'SCV's new system and processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">This has resulted in some residents leaving the Community because of the media attention'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">There was reference to new residents moving in and confidence concerning the impact of marketing campaigns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">There was additional reference in these reports to food changes yet to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Fig Tree asserts that this documentation shows continued knowledge by Prime concerning SCV managing the villages and of changes to the food system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Fig Tree also argues that it provides additional support for the proposition that such knowledge was being received in circumstances which alerted Prime to the possibility of the existence of alternative rights in the sense contemplated by an election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">I will address this submission below in the Analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">On that day (15 August 2007) there was a meeting attended by Messrs Lewski and Jaques on behalf of Prime and by SCV's Managing Director, Mr Roberts, Christopher Bassett, chief operations officer and Mr Buckner, then SCV's chief financial officer and two other representatives of SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">There is very little direct evidence of this meeting other than the contents of notes apparently prepared by Mr Buckner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">He was called to confirm he created the notes but neither he nor anyone in attendance could give detailed evidence as to what was discussed at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There are topics recorded on Mr Buckner's notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">They include 'Landlord's right of termination', 'convert to retirement villages', 'new residency agreements not to disadvantage existing residents', 'SCV assignment doc-include prov re-home care', 'caretaker's training for RV compliance assessment', 'legal representatives swap details', 'Prime Trust will produce own PID' and a variety of other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Mr Lewski's evidence as to the meeting of 15 August 2007 was that to the best of his recollection 'we discussed the contents of the Community Summary Reports'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">He said that he informed Mr Roberts that the reports did not contain any significant content relating to the villages of which he had not been previously aware and that Mr Roberts agreed with that observation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Fig Tree says that the diary note of the meeting provides incontrovertible objective evidence that other topics were discussed at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">If that submission is intended to suggest that any or each topic on the diary note was discussed, I cannot accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">It is not clear whether this was a list of topics which might form an agenda for discussion or an aide-memoire, or whether or not the discussion on those topics actually ensued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Again, Fig Tree relies on the fact that Mr Jaques, who may have been able to corroborate the evidence of Mr Lewski if it were true, was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Fig Tree strongly contends that the evidence of Mr Lewski should be disbelieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Mr Lewski referred to the fact that at the 15 August 2007 meeting there was a brief discussion but not in any detail, on the reports relating to each of the Prime villages; that there was no discussion of any changes to the Village Life System; that SCV did refer to incomplete negotiations between it and Fig Tree; he stated that if the commercial arrangements were resolved then SCV would seek Prime's consent for an assignment of the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">On this topic, Mr Lewski gave evidence that he expressly reserved Prime's rights on the assignment question pending further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Although Fig Tree contends that Mr Lewski's evidence on this topic (amongst several) should not be accepted, he was not challenged in cross-examination on this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">This was obviously a very important issue as it went, amongst other things, to the question of whether or not at this stage Prime was conveying to SCV either directly or as Fig Tree's agent that Prime would agree to the assignment, thereby electing to affirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In my view the absence of cross-examination of Mr Lewski's evidence on this topic means that Fig Tree's submission is not open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">To the contrary, and in any event, I consider that his evidence should be accepted, it being inherently plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">At no time had Prime formally or informally done other than keep its position open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">It was clearly still gathering information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It knew its consent would be needed when it had that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">There is no evidence at all of Prime in any sense, internally or externally, saying that it would consent to the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Fig Tree also submits that Mr Lewski's evidence that he does not recall other aspects of the discussion at the meeting should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I disagree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">I note that even the author of the diary note had no recollection of the content of the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">This is not particularly surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Nor is it so in relation to Mr Lewski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Further, it is unclear what it is that Fig Tree asserts was conveyed to Prime at this meeting which gave Prime the requisite knowledge to elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">In all the circumstances described above, Prime submits it was not at any time, prior to or during August 2007 provided with sufficient information regarding the changes which as a matter of fact had already been implemented as between Fig Tree and SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Alternatively, it was not informed of the further changes that were expressly proposed, especially regarding food services, so as to require a conclusion that Prime had been put to its election whether or not to accept those changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The difficulty for Fig Tree is that it had effectively stepped out of the picture and had been able in significant measure to achieve the objective internally expressed by one of its managing directors, to 'get away from SCV'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Specifically in relation to the communications between 15 and 16 August 2007, there was no evidence that Fig Tree was aware of any of the content of the communications between Prime and SCV on those dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">There is, therefore, no evidence of any direct communication to Fig Tree by Prime of an affirmation and accordingly even if anything associated with the 15 August 2007 constituted an affirmation by Prime, the absence of unequivocal communication by Prime to Fig Tree would preclude that contention succeeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">There is no evidence of any other communication from Fig Tree or SCV to Prime prior to 13 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">On the day after the meeting (16 August 2007), emails were exchanged between SCV and Mr Jaques of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">SCV requested approval for expenditure at the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">In a letter from SCV on the same day, there was reference to the 15 August 2007 meeting; reference to further expenditure and costing; reference to the residential tenancy agreement; and to the electronic version of the report, presumably of the day before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">It confirms that: 
 Mark has advised that he will liaise with you directly regarding the various other points raised with you in yesterdays' meeting as some of these will form dialogue with Mike Gordon as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">

 
 Bill, please don't hesitate to contact me directly should you require any further information relating to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">
 On 23 August 2007 in a Fig Tree Managing Directors' report it was recorded: Operationally, SCV is managing the village on a day to day basis, despite their now representing that it lacks the appropriate real estate licences to do so --- on their now developed logic that they are just doing it for Village Life under Village Life's real estate licences, which is an onerous (sic erroneous) conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">However, the pragmatic position is that SCV is operating the villages and imposing its systems as was intended and , in so doing, taking full responsibility for the day to day management of the villages, as was contemplated by the Assignment Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">(emphasis added) Once again, Prime points to the fact that this information was not conveyed to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Prime says it expected the Village Life System to apply not that SCV would operate the villages and 'impose its own system as was intended'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">There were further requests for expenditure on each of 27 and 31 August, 4 and 6 September, 3 and 7 September, 10 September and 18 and 19 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">It is unnecessary to go into the detail but in each instance the requests were approved by Mr Jaques.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Fig Tree asserts that it is unequivocal conduct by Mr Jaques of Prime knowing and permitting SCV to perform the WMSAs and thereby communicating that fact to Fig Tree's agent, SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">These were small matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Taken in context, even taken collectively with all other pieces of information Prime had received, its knowledge at this stage as to the manner in which SCV would apply or was applying the Village Life System fell well short of comprehensive understanding of the changes in the villages likely to be effected by the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">There is also an indication in the 10 September 2007 expenditure request for a larger waste bin that in Mr Jaques response he asks the question whether the need for the bin was due to the change in the way that SCV is providing food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Fig Tree contends this shows clearly that Prime, through Mr Jaques, was aware of a change in the way that SCV was providing food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Prime, on the other hand, contends in its pleadings that it first became aware of the nature and extent of changes in the food system in late October 2007 after Mr Bosel reported observations he had made and received to Mr Lewski and Mr Jaques.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">It would certainly seem that Mr Jaques at least at this stage, 10 September 2007, had knowledge of some of the changes in the way that SCV was providing food at least in the Maryborough village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">However, a communication about expenditure on bins at one village is hardly the way in which Prime would be informed of significant and broad ranging changes to the food system to apply universally in all villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">On 13 September 2007 Fig Tree wrote to Prime proposing that the existing WMSAs be terminated and replaced by Prime entering into new agreements with SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">It enclosed a proposed new agreement and invited Prime to consult with its professional advisors and to contact one or other of the two named senior executives in the event there were any questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The proposed agreement did not suggest any relevant change to the obligations owed by Fig Tree under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">In particular, the proposed new agreements with SCV still provided for all of those obligations and notably there was no change to the provisions which provided that the villages would be managed in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Fig Tree contends that the effect of the agreement and the Assignment Agreement was that SCV would be obliged to continue to manage the villages in accordance with that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Although the proposed new agreement still contemplated that manuals and therefore the Village Life System could be altered, notably the power to alter that system would still lie with Fig Tree and it was not proposed that power be transferred to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">But it is necessary again to focus on Prime's complaint that its concern was not confined to what was required under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Rather, its main concern developed on learning of the changes that were actually taking place in purported performance of the WMSAs subsequent to execution of the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">On the following day, 14 September 2007, there were monthly investor statements identifying the date of payment as 14 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The documents were on SCV letterheads addressed to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">It revealed the amounts accounted for on the statements for August 2007 were received by Prime's bank and accordingly that business was continuing in the usual way concerning accounting and banking receipts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Accordingly, Fig Tree argues, this reflected continuation of the mechanism as to how Prime performed its obligation to pay various accounts, that is, by permitting relevant amounts to be deducted from what was otherwise due to it, conduct which Fig Tree argues is consistent with or constitutes affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">On 23 September 2007, again, in the Fig Tree Managing Director's report to the Board of Management prepared by Mr Lonie about the assignment of management rights it was recorded 'operationally, SCV is managing the villages on a day to day basis ... however the pragmatic position is that SCV is operating the villages and imposing its system as was intended'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Once again, Prime complains that it was unaware of this fact --- indeed it was inconsistent with the obligations under the draft assignment agreement to operate the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">On 25 September 2007 the minutes of a Fig Tree Board meeting note the failure of SCV 'to explain the changes in their operating systems in comparison to Village Life'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Once again, Prime complains that it was unaware of this fact --- indeed it was inconsistent with the obligations under the draft assignment agreement to operate the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">On 28 September 2007, Prime's solicitors wrote to Fig Tree seeking further information and advising that they were reviewing the documents and would revert in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">However, on 3 October 2007, Prime purported to terminate the WMSAs and required Fig Tree to make arrangements to surrender management control and possession of each village to Prime by 17 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Prime in this communication relied on two grounds to justify its purported termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The first was that 'by purporting to assign its rights' Fig Tree had repudiated the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">The second was that 'by delivering management control and occupation of the villages to SCV Group', Fig Tree had repudiated the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">As pointed out above, the letter was sent without any further communication occurring between Prime and Fig Tree, notwithstanding the invitation expressed in the 13 September 2007 letter from Fig Tree to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">On 24 November 2007, Fig Tree's Managing Director's Report records: 
 the financial solution that emerged in February 2007 to sell the management rights was logical at the time but had turned into a nightmare as we have probably been to (sic-too) willing to compromise to collect the money and have thus let SCV get away with aberrations that, in any other circumstances, would not be acceptable '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">(emphasis added) 
 Of course Prime was necessarily unaware prior to termination of the Report or, more importantly of Fig Tree's view and whether Fig Tree's summary of the problem was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">It does, however, accord with the case Prime now advances and does not sit easily with arguments advanced by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Witnesses
 Each of the parties called oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Fig Tree was critical of Prime's witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">I have not accepted those criticisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">There were many objections raised to the content of witness statements and other documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">To have dealt with all of those objections in the course of the trial would have been cumbersome and would have substantially delayed witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">In most instances I reserved rulings on objections and took the evidence of witnesses subject to the ruling on the objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">The objections and my rulings on them are collected as an annexure to and at the end of these reasons in Appendix A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Generally speaking, the oral evidence for each of the parties was given by witnesses in one of four categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Each of the parties called company officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">In the case of Fig Tree, those officers were Mr Stephen Lonie, the company Managing Director; Mr Robert Dubery, the Company Secretary; and Ms Anne Kratzke, the Field Manager and Food Standards officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">In relation to Prime, it was Mr Bill Lewski, the Managing Director and Mr Michael Bosel, the General Manager who commenced in September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Evidence was also given by officers of SCV, specifically the Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary, Mr Glenn Buckner and the National Business Manager of SCV, Mr Ian John Minett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The second category of witnesses was the category of managers of the various villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Witnesses falling into that category were, for Fig Tree: 
Mrs Christine Nash (Village Life Hervey Bay, Queensland) 
 And for Prime: 
Ms Natalie Donnelly (Village Life Earlville, Queensland);
Ms Karen Dean (Village Life Hackham 1 and Hackham 2, South Australia);
Ms Marilyn Mausolf (Village Life Christie Downs, South Australia);
Ms Christene Hodgson (Village Life Gladstone, Queensland); and
Mr Mark McLean (Village Life Townsville, Queensland)
 The third category of witnesses were residents at the villages specifically: 
Ms Brenda Jackson (Village Life Christie Downs, South Australia); and
Mr Jack Hirst (Village Life Evanston, South Australia).</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Finally, there were expert witnesses giving opinion evidence on the manner in which the villages were managed at various times in relation to the various topics referred to above and the consequences of such management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The nature of the food changes was addressed in the evidence of the on-site managers called by Prime, namely, Mrs Donnelly, Ms Hodgson and Mr McLean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">It also came from the evidence of Ms Kratzke and Mrs Nash called by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Evidence was given by Mrs Christine Nash, the on-site manager in Hervey Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Mrs Nash said that as an independent contractor of Village Life Hervey Bay she was required to adhere very closely to Village Life's procedures manual which set out the content of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Important features of that system as it operated between 2002 and 2006 included the requirement that residents of the village would be provided with three meals per day prepared by the on-site managers from fresh ingredients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">She said that the Village Life System also required that lunch be provided to residents in the communal area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Residents were encouraged to come from their rental units to the communal dining area to dine with other residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The communal dining arrangements allowed on-site managers to assure themselves of the wellbeing of the residents through the meal book, a diary displayed in the communal dining room so that residents could notify village managers in advance of missing a meal and requiring their meal to be put aside for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Mrs Nash noted that if a resident did not appear for a meal without recording their name in the book that she or her husband who was the other on-site manager of Village Life, Hervey Bay would check on that resident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">From 2006 Fig Tree permitted on-site managers to prepare takeaway meals for residents two nights a week so long as they did not do so on consecutive nights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">Fig Tree also permitted the managers to prepare one takeaway lunch per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Those meals were still prepared by the on-site managers from fresh ingredients and the managers were required to inform Fig Tree (or Village Life as it then was) of the particular days on which takeaway meals were provided to the residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">This system continued in operation until SCV assumed management of the villages in around September 2007, according to her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In particular, the way in which lunches and dinners were prepared changed insofar as the protein component of those meals, that is, meat, eggs and vegetable proteins were typically ordered from outside suppliers and delivered on a frozen basis to the village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Although residents continued to eat lunch meals in the communal dining areas, they were required to collect their evening meal in takeaway plastic containers from the communal dining area at lunchtime after the meals had been thawed for one to two days beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Under the SCV system residents retained the option to leave their evening meal in the communal fridge and to eat in the communal dining area at a time convenient to them although in practice, no resident ever did that in the experience of Mrs Nash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Evidence was given by Ms Dean, one of the village managers, that under the new food system introduced by SCV, she as a manager could only give the residents precooked roasts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">She could not go to a butcher and buy the fresh roasts if she wished to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Secondly, under the new SCV food system, the food came in plastic containers similar to typical rectangular Chinese takeaway style containers and the managers were restricted to dealing with food suppliers including local butchers who were nominated by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">She said that in addition to the prepared food being delivered by the food suppliers, they were to be heated and plated by Ms Dean and her partner but also served with vegetables and fruit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The lunch was always either precooked or pre-prepared and the evening meals were a combination of pre-prepared food and other food, although most of it was prepared and came in prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Ms Dean gave evidence that on Christmas day she and her partner resumed serving fresh food, that is, buying in fresh meats from their own supplier because notwithstanding the fact that they were still working for SCV, she received a phone call to return to the village urgently to deal with what staff described as a riot in the dining room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Residents had taken the evening meals from the fridge, thrown them everywhere, banging on the door and saying they had had enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Ms Dean says she was unable to contact SCV to have variations made to the set menu so took matters into her own hands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Ms Dean gave evidence that she could recall being informed by residents who were leaving the villages that they were leaving because they were not used to eating this type of food and they had been under the impression when joining the villages that there would be managers on duty all the time, that dinner could be eaten in the dining room and those matters were not followed through.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">There was not much evidence of this in the written complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Ms Dean said that she would ask the residents to write down their concerns of that nature but the general response was that they did not want to cause any trouble and they just wanted to forget about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Another manager, Ms Marilyn Mausolf, gave evidence that under the SCV system she would be cooking the vegetables and reheating the 'protein' for lunch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">She said that SCV dinners were put into containers and put into the community fridge for the residents to take home to their units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Initially SCV sent food to the village at Christie Downs by way of its supplier which was referred to as a 'starter pack' but the food was insufficient to feed the residents of the village and she received bad feedback from the residents in relation to the food that was introduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">She explained in cross-examination that she would not be prepared to live on the food which was supplied by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Mrs Christene Hodgson, another village manager, gave evidence that at the Gladstone Village the communal dining room did not have a microwave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">She said that if she had not received an item that had been ordered from SCV's food supplier, she was not able to get a similar item from a local supplier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">She also gave evidence that she had been informed in Bundaberg (at a SVC forum) that she would be doing things a lot differently with SCV than she had been with Village Life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">In particular, she was told that she would not be required to cook any longer under SCV but that 'we would just be regenerating protein and preparing side salads and vegetables that we would have previously ordered [from SCV Group's food supplier]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Evidence was also given by Mrs Donnelly who was the on-site manager of Village Life, Earlville.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Her evidence was that SCV directed her to manage Earlville in accordance with the provision of her contract of employment with SCV rather than in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">She said that when SCV took over the management of Earlville, she no longer referred to the Village Life manuals for guidance about the management of the village as the SCV model was quite different from the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">She said that Earlville changed from the Village Life System of food preparation and delivery to the SCV food system on 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">She was instructed by SCV that she and her husband were permitted to serve only one meal per day in the communal dining area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">She said that residents had an option of eating their take home meal in the communal dining area when it was open, although there was no microwave in that area so residents could not reheat a take home meal from there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Under SCV, Mrs Donnelly and her husband were paid for no more than three hours work per day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">She said that prior to 31 October 2007, when the SCV system of food service was introduced, the only frozen food which Mr and Mrs Donnelly served to residents of Earlville were frozen peas, frozen beans and corn cobbs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">In contrast to this, Mrs Donnelly said that she was required to prepare and serve the frozen ready prepared food provided by the supplier nominated by SCV both at lunch and for the evening meal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Her evidence was that it was permissible for her and her husband to supplement the SCV meals with desserts which they had prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Mr and Mrs Donnelly did not have time, however, to prepare dessert within the three hours per day for which they were paid by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Ms Brenda Jackson, a resident of Village Life, Christie Downs gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Her evidence was that since it opened up in around 2003, residents prior to SCV's management of the village had never taken more than one takeaway lunch meal and never more than two takeaway evening meals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Another resident, Mr Jack Hirst said that he left the Evanston Village in November 2007 after the SCV food had been introduced 'because of the quality of the food that we was (sic-were) getting deteriorated'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">He could only experience the SCV food system for a month prior to leaving the Evanston Village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">It was said that month was enough for him to make his decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Findings
 The summary of the communications between May and the end of July 2007, according to Fig Tree, is that Prime had knowledge of the substance and effect of Fig Tree's ASX announcement that a formal Assignment Agreement had been entered into for a total consideration of $14 million subject to conditions precedent and that Fig Tree was in the process of obtaining Prime's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Fig Tree says that Prime was informed of the involvement of SCV and the nature of that involvement particularly in relation to the division of management tasks and responsibilities allocated as between SCV and Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Fig Tree contends that Prime knew that SCV had an obligation to operate the Prime villages in accordance with the Village Life System; that Fig Tree's intention was that Prime would receive legal documentation from Fig Tree within a short period of time after 30 July 2007; that SCV were completing audit reports of the villages which were the subject of the Assignment Agreement to be made available to Prime and other village owners; that SCV had engaged former Fig Tree managers on 90 day contracts to allow adequate time for Fig Tree's independent contractors to assess the SCV employment contract and finally that SCV having over the years trialled several methods of delivering food to residents ranging from 'cooked fresh' to 'cooked chill' systems, found the 'cook freeze' method to be the best method and that the frozen components of the SCV meals were 'no different to what you may prepare at home'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">What Prime stresses, however, is that there was crucial information not communicated to it or otherwise known by Prime which was relevant to Prime's election to affirm or terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Prime points to the fact that there is no evidence of any communication from Fig Tree to Prime before the end of July 2007 which provided details of the Assignment Agreement, its implementation, or changes that SCV had either already made or were to make to the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">A dominant consideration in this regard is that the 30 July 2007 letter from SCV to Prime addressed in some detail the food delivery system which SCV proposed to use, however, according to Prime the representations made in the letter stand in stark contrast to the evidence from the managers regarding the food actually delivered under the SCV system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Prime contends and I so find that the innocuous language of the communications from Fig Tree or SCV to Prime in the May, June and July 2007 period was not notification to Prime of the full nature of the changes in respect of the management of the Prime villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Prime was assured that there would be no changes to its current contracts, being the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Prime contends and I accept that (relatively soon after entry into the Assignment Agreement of 30 May 2007) Fig Tree had knowledge or opinions to which Prime did not have access as to: 
(a) the extent and permanency of Fig Tree's handover to SCV; 
 
(b) SCV's plans to introduce a management system that was materially different to the Village Life System; and 
 
(c) the quite different and, in some respects, poor performance by SCV of its management responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The information which Prime did not have or was not communicated to Prime was that on and from 1 June 2007: 
(a) SCV had assumed operational management responsibility for all of the villages;
 
(b) Fig Tree had ceased to distribute its existing promotional brochures as a result of a legal determination that the brochures misrepresented the current services provided by SCV;
 
(c) SCV planned to provide a food service in the Prime villages that was to be different from the Village Life System or that there was at least a possibility of the Village Life System being varied by SCV; and
 
(d) that SCV's changing of the Village Life System model would impact on village owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">I find that as at 21 June 2007, Prime was unaware that it was the view of Fig Tree officers that SCV's poor management of the villages was 'destroying [Fig Tree's] business' and that SCV's management of the transition of responsibilities in respect of the villages had been 'nothing less than poor' (see the Managing Director's Report to the Board).</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Also by this date, Prime was unaware that Fig Tree's operations would be reduced to 'skeleton staff' and be relocated to SCV's offices in Maroochydore by the end of July 2007; that cash flow was a key issue for Fig Tree and the immediate critical issue for Fig Tree was to get the new WMSAs signed off by the owners so that Fig Tree could settle the remaining $13.5 million as soon as possible; that SCV had altered the terms of engagement of on-site village managers from an independent contract to a contract of employment; that SCV proposed variations of the Village Life System to suit its own purposes; and that SCV had failed to provide Fig Tree with any transition plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Further, Prime contends and I find that by 20 July 2007 it was unaware that: 
(a) Fig Tree considered that the transfer of the operational management responsibilities to SCV on 1 June 2007 had been premature; that SCV's 'on the ground' performance had been poor; and that SCV was incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">(b) Fig Tree was aware that 'the SCV system that we have let them introduce, is not identical to the Village Life System', raising the prospect of village owners contending that 'there is a fundamental failure to deliver the prescribed outcomes in accordance with the original management contract';
 
(c) Fig Tree faced difficulties in maintaining the integrity of the Village Life System due to the departure of its operational staff; and
 
(d) Fig Tree was rapidly shedding any real capacity to manage the Prime villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">On and after 24 July 2007, Prime was unaware that Fig Tree planned for all Fig Tree on-site managers, human resources and other personnel other than some accounting and administration staff to be made redundant by 24 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Notice of termination to staff was given on 25 July 2007 effective 24 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Fig Tree emphasises for the purpose of the affirmation case, that the events in 2007 illustrate that Prime had ample knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The point is made that Prime did not call most of its Board members, its company secretary, its solicitors, other senior executives, members of the DDC to deal with the question of Prime's knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">In particular emphasis is placed on Prime's failure to call Mr Jaques who was the director to whom the 30 July 2007 letter was sent and whom had several meetings with SCV and email exchanges with SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Fig Tree contends that in accordance with Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 the unexplained failure to call any of these witnesses, particularly Mr Jaques, should lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted Prime's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">In my view this submission overlooks the fact that Fig Tree has the onus on the affirmation point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">I would need to be satisfied that Fig Tree had established on the balance of probabilities that Prime had sufficient relevant knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">If Fig Tree does not get to that point, the rule in Jones v Dunkel cannot be used to fill gaps in Fig Tree's case: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298 at 308, 312 and 320-321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Fig Tree has not discharged its onus of proving that Prime did have knowledge of the significant matters that Prime has emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">THE NATURE AND EFFECT OF CHANGES UNDER SCV 
 Much of the summarised documentary evidence goes to the affirmation issue on which Fig Tree had the onus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">However this is a threshold issue in relation to whether Prime has established a repudiation by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">For Prime's part it places significant emphasis on the Village Life model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">It contends that prior to 2006, the model which Fig Tree had developed involved physical design features and operating systems which I have described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">In the confidential annexure I have focussed on some particular features of the system which Prime submits were of importance and why that was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">To give these reasons some context, confidential detail aside, it is necessary to discuss the evidence albeit at some level of generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Food, Managers' Terms and Residency
 Ultimately when evidence was adduced in relation to food changes, it was in relatively narrow compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">In saying this I do not consider that it was insignificant or insufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Prime contends that even if the Assignment Agreement had no effect because conditions precedent to it had not been satisfied, it was nevertheless clear on the evidence, particularly the evidence of the on-site managers and Fig Tree's own admissions that Fig Tree had in fact ceased to perform its obligations under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Accordingly, it had in practical terms effected an assignment of its performance obligations to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Prime says this is a natural conclusion suggested by steps actually taken by Fig Tree and SCV including the fact that Fig Tree released the on-site managers from their contracts and SCV entered into fresh contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Those new contracts were not expressed to be conditional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Secondly, SCV introduced longer term rental contracts to which SCV was named a party, requiring a bond to be paid and signing direct debit facilities to be paid to SCV not Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Additionally, from June 2007, SCV instructed on-site managers to use SCV documentation as the villages were being 're-branded'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Finally, by correspondence delivered to on-site managers from SCV, it was clear that SCV considered that they had taken over exclusive operational management of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Prime says that on any view, whether by effective assignment or by installing SCV as an agent manager, Fig Tree ceased to perform all or substantially all of the management functions at the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Fig Tree implemented new permanent arrangements inconsistent with the Village Life System in relation to food provided to residents and the manner in which it was prepared and served, engagement of on-site managers and conditions of tenancy for residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Prime argues Fig Tree manifested an intention to no longer perform its obligations under the WMSAs or at least, not in accordance with all the terms of the WMSAs and in particular the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">In relation to this issue, Prime contends that the food changes went well beyond anything that might be considered a variation or modification of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">The food changes on Prime's argument were fundamentally at odds with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Prime points out that there is no tenable suggestion that the changes were not intended to be permanent and had Prime not intervened they would have been permanent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">At [33]-[37] above, I summarised the factual assertions made by Prime in the three areas it pleads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The evidence on those topics is analysed further below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">For present purposes, however, I record that in my view, on the evidence, Prime has made good most of its complaints --- particularly in relation to food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">It must be emphasised that by no means all of the complaints were specifically proven at each village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Indeed far from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The complaints, however, comprise a collection of changes to be introduced (or which had already been introduced) at all of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">It was a new management system across the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">ANALYSIS 
 Repudiation --- the Principles
 In Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal Land Council v Sanpine Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 61 ; (2007) 233 CLR 115 , the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayden and Crennan JJ at [44]-[56]) held that a right to terminate a contract arises in respect either of a breach of an essential term or a serious breach of a non-essential term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The High Court held: 
 [44] ... conduct ... which evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract or to fulfil it only in a manner substantially inconsistent with the party's obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">... may be termed renunciation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The test is whether the conduct of one party is such as to convey to a reasonable person, in the situation of the other party, renunciation either of the contract as a whole or of a fundamental obligation under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">... 

 
See also Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632 and Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The High Court reached its decision not upon the ground of breach of an essential obligation, but upon application of the doctrine in relation to intermediate terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The contractual obligations with which Sanpine failed to comply were inessential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">On the true construction of the contract, not every breach would justify a termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The obligations were intermediate terms, but the breaches of the respondent were in a number of respects gross and their consequences were serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">The majority in the High Court also said at [44]: 
 There may be cases where a failure to perform, even if not a breach of an essential term ... manifests unwillingness or inability to perform in such circumstances that the other party is entitled to conclude that the contract will not be performed substantially according to its requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">This overlapping between renunciation and failure of performance may appear conceptually untidy, but unwillingness or inability to perform a contract often is manifested most clearly by the conduct of a party when the time for performance arrives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">In contractual renunciation, actions may speak louder than words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">
 While the ordinary remedy for breach of contract is an award in damages, a sufficiently serious breach may entitle termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">The answer to whether there has been repudiation by a sufficiently serious breach of a non-essential term may be influenced by whether the breach will give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he or she should obtain from the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Identification of the benefit is therefore important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">It is to be considered in light of the language of the contract and the circumstances in which the parties contracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">To complete this topic, regard should also be had to other aspects of the legal analysis by the majority in Koompahtoo (citations omitted).</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">After consideration of the well-known exposition in Tramways (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632 comparing conditions and warranties by Jordan CJ, their Honours said: 
 48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">What Jordan CJ said as to substantial performance, and substantial breach, is now to be read in the light of later developments in the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">What is of immediate significance is his reference to the question he was addressing as one of construction of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">It is the common intention of the parties, expressed in the language of their contract, understood in the context of the relationship established by that contract and (in a case such as the present) the commercial purpose it served, that determines whether a term is "essential", so that any breach will justify termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">

 
 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">The second relevant circumstance is where there has been a sufficiently serious breach of a non-essential term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">In Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd , the English Court of Appeal was concerned with a stipulation as to seaworthiness in a charterparty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Breaches of such a stipulation could vary widely in importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">They could be trivial or serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">The Court of Appeal held that to the accepted distinction between "conditions" and "warranties", that is, between stipulations that were in their nature essential and others, there must be added a distinction, operative within the class of non-essential obligations, between breaches that are significantly serious to justify termination and other breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">This was a recognition that, although as a matter of construction of a contract it may not be the case that any breach of a given term will entitle the other party to terminate, some breaches of such a term may do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Diplock LJ said[14] that the question whether a breach by one party relieves the other of further performance of his obligations cannot always be answered by treating a contractual undertaking as either a "condition" or a "warranty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Of some stipulations "all that can be predicated is that some breaches will and others will not give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract; and the legal consequences of a breach of such an undertaking, unless provided for expressly in the contract, depend upon the nature of the event to which the breach gives rise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">

 
 50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">In this way Diplock LJ set the policy of the law favouring certainty of outcome through the classification of terms as conditions against that which encourages contractual performance and favours restriction of the right to terminate to cases where breach occasions serious prejudice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">As it is put in the eleventh edition of Treitel: 

 
"[T]he policy of leaning in favour of classifying stipulations as intermediate terms can be said to promote the interests of justice by preventing the injured party from rescinding on grounds that are technical or unmeritorious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">" 
 
 
 Perhaps the adoption of other taxonomies for contractual stipulations might achieve similar outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">However, Hongkong Fir was decided in 1961 and has long since passed into the mainstream law of contract as understood and practised in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">

 
 51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">It may be true that this Court has yet to accept Hongkong Fir as an essential element in the grounds for decision in any particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">However, in Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd , Mason ACJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ referred to Hongkong Fir with evident approval and said that the concept of the intermediate and innominate term brings a greater flexibility to the law of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">With that in mind, it was entirely appropriate for Campbell J to proceed with an analysis of the facts in which Hongkong Fir was applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">

 
 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The practical utility of a classification which includes intermediate terms, and the consequent greater flexibility of which the Court spoke in Ankar , appears from several consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">First, the interests of justice are promoted by limiting rights to rescind to instances of serious and substantial breaches of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Secondly, a just outcome is facilitated in cases where the breach is of a term which is inessential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">

 
 53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">As will appear later in these reasons, we rest our decision in the appeal not upon the ground of breach of an essential obligation, but upon application of the doctrine respecting intermediate terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">
 Repudiation --- Fig Tree's General Contentions
 The case which Fig Tree meets in the Prime cross-claim is that there has been either renunciation or repudiation by breach of an essential term or alternatively a sufficiently serious breach of a non-essential or intermediate term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Fig Tree contends that the promise to manage in accordance with the Village Life System could not possibly be an essential term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Fig Tree argues that such a promise is a classic example of an intermediate or innominate term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">For reasons discussed in the next section, I accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Fig Tree contends that at its highest, Prime's case would only reveal that during the transition period provided for in the Assignment Agreement, Fig Tree failed to prevent SCV from departing from the Village Life System in certain respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Accordingly in those respects it may be argued that Fig Tree had broken its promise to manage in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">Fig Tree says that the highest Prime's evidence comes in relation to that alleged breached is in the following respects: As addressed below, I consider that this summary significantly understates the impact of the SCV changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">As a point of principle, Fig Tree contends that the benefit to which Prime was entitled under the WMSAs is the maximisation of its financial return from the properties over a 25 year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">A central plank of Fig Tree's case on repudiation is that Prime and its witnesses have exaggerated the alleged seriousness of the breach and the inadequacy of damages as a remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">In relation to the question of damages, Fig Tree argues that Prime's own business records tendered during cross-examination reveal that on 28 February 2008, Prime published to the ASX its Financial Report and made other public announcements, none of which suggested that any material loss had been suffered by Prime as a result of Fig Tree's actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Although Mr Lewski explained this on the basis of a materiality threshold, Fig Tree says that his explanation was unconvincing for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">First, despite Mr Bosel conceding that in April and May 2008, Prime had commissioned CB Richard Ellis to conduct valuations for eight out of the 12 villages in the Fig Tree portfolio, no evidence was led from those valuers nor sought to be tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">On the basis of Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298 , it was submitted it should be inferred that their evidence would not have assisted Prime's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Further, Fig Tree submits that when on 14 July 2008, Prime released to the market its Directors' assessment of the outlook for the financial year ended 30 June 2009, the reference to the valuations in that release revealed only a 'small downward movement on the Fig Tree Portfolio'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">It attributed that small downward movement to increases in discount rates since the previous valuation rather than any actions of Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Fig Tree also argues that the expert opinion evidence called by Mr Ludlow did not take into account and was not based on any of the material in relation to the valuation reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">It is argued that while there has been some diminution in occupancy rates of the villages, there is no admissible evidence as to causation of that diminution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">Fig Tree objected to Mr Ludlow expressing an opinion about the causal nexus and while I allowed the evidence subject to objection, I have concluded that Mr Ludlow's evidence is admissible for reasons expressed in Appendix A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">Fig Tree also contends that Prime's evidence 'is unreliable and exaggerated', first, as to the severity of the damage to Prime as a result of the departure from the Village Life system and, secondly, on the basis that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the systems which SCV sought to introduce according to the evidence of Professor Capra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Professor Capra gave evidence as to the advantages of serving pre-prepared food of the kind offered under the SCV food system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Her evidence was to the effect that such food is not shown to be less nutritious than freshly prepared products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">There was also evidence from Ms Dorrett as to the advantages of the pre-prepared food of the kind manufactured by Prepared Foods Australia which was the predominant supplier of the prepared food under the SCV system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Ms Kratzke also said that one of the advantages of pre-prepared food was that the quality of the meal became less dependent on the cooking skills of the on-site managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Significantly, Fig Tree suggests that the only evidence which exists and is uninfluenced by the litigation is the contemporaneous business records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">It says those records tell a very different story from the evidence adduced by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">From that source, it is evident, according to Fig Tree, that: As to all of these submissions I observe that the fact that the extent of damage may not either have been significant or then known to be significant does not mean that a breach may not be serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">The law permits termination for repudiation when a serious breach of an intermediate term has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Terminating may prevent significant damage being sustained in the future as a result of a serious breach of an intermediate term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">No Repudiation by Entry into the Assignment Agreement
 The Assignment Agreement makes it a condition precedent to any assignment of the WMSAs that Prime's consent be obtained (cl 2.1(e)(ii)) or that Fig Tree agree with the owner of the wholesale complex (Prime) to terminate its 12 agreements with Fig Tree and enter into new agreements with SCV on terms substantially similar to the terms of Prime's agreements with Fig Tree (cl 2.1(e)(v)(B)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">Clauses 2.1 and 9.1 of the Assignment Agreement relevantly to this issue provided: 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 

 
 2.1 Completion is conditional upon the following:
 ...
 (e) in respect of a Wholesale Complex: 

...
 
(ii) the parties obtaining any necessary consent or approval of a third party to the assignment or novation of the Wholesale Management Rights Agreement for that Wholesale Complex to the Purchaser with effect from the Completion Date; and
 
 
(iii) the parties generally obtaining all other statutory consents and approvals that may be reasonably required to give effect to this agreement or the transactions contemplated by this agreement; and
 
 
(iv) the parties generally obtaining all other third party consents and approvals that may be reasonably required to give effect to this agreement; and
 
 ... 

 SPECIFIED CONTRACTS
 
 9.1 The Vendor agrees to use its reasonable endeavours and to act promptly and reasonably in seeking to either: 

 
 (a) obtain the consent of: 

 
(i) the parties to the Specified Contracts ( Third Parties ); and
 
 
(ii) the Bodies Corporate,
 
 
to the assignment or novation of the Specified Contracts with effect from the Completion Date; or
 
 
 (b) terminate the Specified Contracts and enable the Purchaser to enter into contracts with the Third Parties to the Specified Contracts on terms either substantially similar to the terms of the Specified Contracts or otherwise on terms acceptable to the Purchaser acting reasonably on or before the Completion Date ( New Specified Contracts ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">
 I accept Fig Tree's argument that any transfer of rights and obligations under the Assignment Agreement was subject to obtaining Prime's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">If consent were not obtained, the contemplated assignment would have no force and the WMSAs between Prime and Fig Tree would continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Fig Tree could not force Prime to give consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">However, by cl 9.1 of the Assignment Agreement, Fig Tree bound itself to attempt to obtain Prime's consent to assignment or novation in favour of SCV or to terminate each WMSA and enable SCV to enter into new contracts with Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Both options led to the result that Fig Tree could no longer perform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Fig Tree contends that the only way this could work as a renunciation was if cl 9.1 were interpreted such that if consent or a new agreement were not forthcoming, Fig Tree was nevertheless unequivocally promising SCV that it would terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Fig Tree says this would be a 'ridiculous construction'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">I agree that this is not the preferred construction even though Fig Tree was keen to obtain payment and walk away swiftly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">The better construction to be given to cl 9.1 is that Fig Tree would use its best reasonable endeavours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">Such a clause would be implied at law in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">Fig Tree contends that given the value which the Assignment Agreement attributed to the WMSAs, namely, a sum in excess of $3.5 million, SCV could be taken to be unwilling to proceed unless the conditions were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">I accept Fig Tree's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Taken in isolation, I do not consider that entry into the Assignment Agreement constituted a repudiation of the obligations under the WMSA by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">Without Prime's consent, no assignment would be valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">(No consent has been given).</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">On a different argument, Fig Tree also contends that it may subcontract its obligations under the WMSAs without Prime's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">A contract may expressly or impliedly prohibit vicarious performance, the question being one of construction in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">In Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 40 ; (2006) 149 FCR 395 Finn and Sundberg JJ observed at [59]: 
 It characteristically is said that it is a question of construction whether a contract itself or particular rights or obligations involve personal considerations such as to render the contract or those rights unassignable, or the obligations not delegable: see eg Tolhurst v Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900) Ltd [1903] AC 414 at 416---17; National Carbonising Co Ltd v British Coal Distillation Ltd (1936) 2 All ER 1012 at 1017; Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd v Telstra Corp Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 104 at 118---20; see also Furmston, (ed), 6.299, 6.301---6.324; Chitty on Contracts , [19-053]; cf Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract , [8.6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">However, given the particular purpose for which the contract and its terms are being construed, implicit in the question of construction are, ordinarily, issues of characterisation and of inference in which the significance to be attributed, variously, to identity, to the qualities or attributes one or both parties are expected to exhibit and to the character of the parties' relationship, can loom large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">

 
See also Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 104 , at 118-120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Of course, the legal barrier to assignment of rights is very much lower than the legal barrier applicable to assignment of obligations under a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">As to the proper construction to be given to the question of whether performance can be vicarious, Fig Tree contends that the focus of the terms is on the mode of performance, namely, that the villages be managed in accordance with the Village Life System rather than on any particular person or attribute of Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">I agree that the focus is on the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">However, Fig Tree places very considerable store in the intellectual property that it has developed in the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">The Village Life System for all practical purposes is synonymous with Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">That is at the essence of the concerns which Prime has about the assignment to SCV of the obligations under the contract in circumstances where retention of reliable performance of the Village Life System cannot be guaranteed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">If there is one aspect of the WMSAs which is central to the relationship between the parties, it is the performance of the Village Life System or more accurately, Fig Tree's Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">(That does not mean that each component of the Village Life System is an essential term).</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">That the parties contemplated that the WMSAs could be assigned is a relevant consideration in deciding whether that assignment could be without consent of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">Objectively viewed, what would have been in the minds of Fig Tree and Prime at the time of execution of the WMSAs was that if all of the services provided under the WMSAs and, in particular, in the context of the provision of Fig Tree's Village Life System could be substantially guaranteed, in effect, on assignment of the contract, then there would be no proper reason for objection to the contract being assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">But the contractual requirement for consent was the very means of ensuring those objectives were attained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">I accept Fig Tree's submission that it is necessary to have regard to the wide range of tasks involved in managing the villages such that it would be improbable that the parties intended that Fig Tree would carry out those tasks through its employees only and through no other means such as by engaging independent contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Clearly the evidence reveals that Fig Tree has always delegated the task of on-site management to husband and a wife management teams engaged by independent contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">However, the question is not whether some tasks such as changing a light fitting can be delegated to independent contractors but whether the performance of the Village Life system necessarily entails that it be performed, at least in a supervisory sense, by Fig Tree rather than (in a supervisory or other sense) by some other third party whom Prime has not had the opportunity to confirm can and will manage in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">Once it can be seen that there is a personal component of each of the WMSAs, namely, the provision by Fig Tree of the Village Life System, it is clear in my view that Fig Tree cannot assign the entirety of its obligations under the WMSAs without Prime's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The fact that it may seek to assign its rights becomes a different but academic issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">While Fig Tree emphasises that the WMSAs contain no term prohibiting assignment, it does not follow that the WMSAs contemplate that assignment is permissible without consent being obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Fig Tree contends that cl 22.2(f) in providing that a reference to a party includes the successors and permitted assigns of the party means 'permitted assigns' in the sense of permitted under the contract not permitted by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">In light of the personal nature of the obligations of Fig Tree under this contract, a proper construction of the agreement requires that 'permitted assigns' be permitted by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">These are each commercial contracts of substantial value as far as Prime is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">It was entitled to protect its position by refusing assignment unless there was a guaranteed performance of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Management in Accordance with the Village Life System was not an Essential Term
 As to the benefit to which Prime is entitled under the WMSAs, Fig Tree argues that Prime's benefit is to obtain the maximisation of its financial return from the properties over a 25 year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">The return is dependent, Fig Tree says, entirely on occupancy rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">Fig Tree says that the parties must be taken to have identified what would be a substantially unacceptable occupancy rate in cl 1.3 by providing that if occupancy falls below 50% for a continuing six month period, Prime will have the right to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Fig Tree says that it is significant that the only fall in occupancy rates which Prime thought were serious enough to warrant the expression of a termination right was if the rate fell below 50% for a continuous six month period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">Accordingly, Fig Tree says that Prime's argument that the benefit to which it was entitled was the benefit of having Fig Tree manage the villages in accordance with the WMSAs is unacceptable because it is clear that the WMSAs were about money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">I have considerable difficulty with this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">There is an obligation to manage in accordance with the Village Life System under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Each contract specifically identifies at the outset that compliance with that obligation is the very means by which Prime will maximise its investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">It is clear that the parties have not expressly identified the promise to manage in accordance with the Village Life System (or any other promise) as being an 'essential term'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Moreover the nature of the promise is one which is referable to a variety of other documents which fall within the definition of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Those documents cover many matters, some of which are important and some of which are trivial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">The WMSAs themselves do contemplate that departures might occur and set out a regime to deal with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">The contract also contemplates that there will be modification of the Village Life System and it appears to me that this is an important consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">In relation to potential breaches, Fig Tree relies on seven references in the WMSAs to possible breaches taking place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">(These are set out in Annexure B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Fig Tree relies on four references in the WMSAs to modifications of the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">These are also set out in Annexure B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">The WMSAs were very long term arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">Prime is described as an investor and Fig Tree is described as the manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Clearly it was expected that Fig Tree would handle problems which might arise from time to time in operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">It would also seek a maximised return for the investor over a period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">It is improbable, in my view, that the parties would have contemplated that each and every operation or compliance difficulty, no matter how trivial and how brief, could give rise to the possibility of termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">Identification of anticipated small potential breaches and provision of a regime for dealing with them, and provision for modification appear to me to be valid arguments which on balance, lead to a conclusion that the promise to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System was an important but not an essential term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">The Promise to Manage the Villages in Accordance with the Village Life System was an Important Intermediate Term
 As Fig Tree correctly points out, Prime has the onus of proof on the repudiation case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Prime contends that the several departures from the Village Life System which were outlined in its pleading are to be regarded as evidence of renunciation by Fig Tree and as being sufficiently serious breaches of a non-essential term of the WMSA which justify termination by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">(Prime also contends that the failure to manage in accordance with the Village Life System is a breach of an essential term but I am not satisfied that the term is essential).</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">A significant feature of Fig Tree's case is that it was not required to obtain Prime's consent to any amendment to its Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Fig Tree contends that the fact that the WMSA has contemplated that Fig Tree could unilaterally amend the content of the documents which defined the Village Life System was of particular significance when it comes to applying the legal test for repudiation in relation to any alleged departures from the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The documents falling within the definition of the system cover a wide range of matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Some of them are clearly less important than others; some of them are quite detailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Fig Tree contends, correctly, that some of the clauses self evidently could not amount to promissory terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">The promise to manage in accordance with the Village Life System would be better characterised as an intermediate term, albeit an important one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">This does not mean that Prime has no remedy in the case of breach of such a term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Its protection in the event of such a breach may be found in its ability to terminate pursuant to cl 1.3 if the occupancy rates fall low enough for long enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Equally, in circumstances where there is a sufficiently serious breach of an intermediate term, Prime may be able to treat that breach as constituting a repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">Management in Accordance with the Village Life System after the Assignment Agreement - Food Changes
 As to the seriousness of the departure from the Village Life System in relation to food, Fig Tree contends that the departure was trivial for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Fig Tree accepts that in relation to the description concerning food in the Village Life System Manuals, there were many pages devoted to the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">But Prime in its pleaded case only points to these aspects of those many pages not being complied with under SCV: 
(a) The food to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">As to this, the essence of Prime's complaint was that SCV required managers to order frozen food supplies from external contractors using a common menu nominated by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">There is no dispute that the frozen food supplies related to some components of some but not all lunch and evening meals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">
(b) A second aspect of the complaint about the SCV food was that SCV did not stipulate the minimum nutritional requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">This could only be relevant, argues Fig Tree, if it was demonstrated that the residents were not served a diet under SCV which did meet their nutritional requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">Fig Tree argues that Prime did not adduce evidence of such a case and Prime withdrew reliance on Mr Bosel's evidence to the extent of complaints about nutritional value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">
(c) The places of which and the manner in which food for the residents would be prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">This essentially replicated the complaint in (a), although it was also pleaded that SCV 'did not permit' managers to prepare fresh cooked meals but required them to use frozen food supplies which they were then required to regenerate and make available to residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Again, Fig Tree, accepts on the evidence that the frozen food supplies comprised part but not all lunch and evening meals and that the procedure described related to evening meals only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">
(d) The places at which and manner in which food was to be provided to the residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">Again, Fig Tree accepted that this was a reference to the five extra take home evening meals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">Accordingly, the substantive changes made under SCV about which Prime complains according to Fig Tree were: 
(a) the introduction of pre-prepared food in relation to components of the lunch and evening meals, although not all such meals; and
 
(b) the introduction of five extra take home evening meals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">Read in the context of what was required under the Village Life System as a whole in relation to food, it is submitted that these two departures were trivial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Breakfast which was one third of the meals offered to the residents was unchanged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">It is accepted that the two changes did not comply with the Village Life System but Fig Tree does not accept that those changes were sufficiently serious as to justify termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Another reason the introduction of the pre-prepared food was not a significant departure from the Village Life System according to Fig Tree was that it was something which Fig Tree itself had considered doing at some stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">Secondly, the on-site managers of the Prime villages could and did serve pre-prepared or frozen food under the Village Life System albeit not from a source nominated by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">Fig Tree argued that the system had many uncontested advantages such as enabling the choice to be offered in situations for the evening meal, being able to ensure consistently high quality food, reduction of costs associated with meal production, less wastage, reduction of the likelihood of food poisoning, reduction of energy consumption, reduction of costs associated with maintaining equipment used in preparing food and less dependency on the cooking ability of the on-site managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Fig Tree argued that it was an acceptable option for a food service which must cater to the residents at a facility such as the Prime villages within a limited budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">In this context Fig Tree emphasised that the residents of the Prime villages were not paying significant sums to stay at those villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">Fig Tree argued that for what they paid, they received housing, laundering of some items and three meals a day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">The expectation of what could be provided by way of food in such circumstances had to be measured by reference to what was paid by the residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Fig Tree accepts that a number of residents and some managers were generally dissatisfied with the changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">But as to this, Fig Tree argues that the residents of the villages were elderly and undoubtedly resistant to change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">It will never be known whether given time and further training of the on-site managers as to techniques in relation to the preparation and presentation of the pre-prepared food, the changes to the food would have been regarded as acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">Fig Tree pointed to the fact that there was evidence of other residents not being unhappy with the changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">Mrs Nash, for example, gave evidence that the residents at the Hervey Bay Village liked choosing their evening meal and liked having the flexibility of being able to have their evening meal in their units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">As to this submission, I would observe that to their credit, many elderly residents would attempt to see 'the glass half full' and adjust to deleterious changes in their conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">This does not mean that in the longer term Prime's investment would not suffer if the changes imposed were sufficiently serious departures from the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">As to these arguments, the question will always come back to an analysis of the seriousness of the breach or breaches, if any.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Prime has never argued that trivial departures could constitute serious breaches entitling termination for repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">The Food Changes were a Serious Breach of the Village Life System Promise
 I do not find the argument on the triviality of the food changes persuasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">If there is a contractual method of supplying food which is objectively viewed as a matter of central importance to the contracting parties and to elderly people in retirement villages, the 'expectation' of what should be provided should be measured by what the contract itself provides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">The totality of the evidence on the food changes established that while there were no material changes to the breakfast arrangements, there were the following changes in relation to lunches and the evening meal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Those meals were no longer prepared on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">Instead: 
(a) The practice was that residents would nominate the meals that they wished to consume for a period of up to a week in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">Those meals were described by SCV in relation to their protein component.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">This was the title given in SCV's internal literature and some correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">The evidence showed that it referred to meat, egg and vegetable protein ingredients in what SCV referred to as being 'wet dishes';
 
(b) managers would purchase the protein components from approved suppliers, in particular, from Prepared Foods Australia rather than from various local suppliers of their choosing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">They would do this rather than prepare and serve the meals that had been prepared on site from fresh ingredients;
 
(c) the protein components from the meals were delivered in a frozen form to each village several days before it was required;
 
(d) the meals were thawed out by managers for a period of some 24 to 48 hours prior to their consumption by the residents;
 
(e) in the case of lunches, the frozen components were heated and then, depending on the actual meal provided, they would be combined with vegetables or salad which was prepared by the on-site managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">The combined meal would be served to residents in the community dining rooms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">However, in the case of the evening meals, those meals would be thawed and would be added to salad or vegetables and then made available at lunchtimes for residents to collect and to take back to their units in order to reheat them and to eat them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">Fig Tree contends that the residents were, in theory, able to leave their dinner meals in the community rooms or to bring them back to the community rooms in the evening for the evening meal and to reheat them and eat them there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">This is clearly an impractical, inconvenient and unseemly practice which is probably why, as pointed out by Fig Tree's witnesses, the residents did not exercise that theoretical option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">In any event, the microwave ovens in the community rooms were not always designed for such purposes, if they had them at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">The concept of the residents queuing to share the use of a small domestic microwave so as to dine together would be a significant departure from the previous food delivery system under the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">Mr Bosel of Prime in his report in connection with Hervey Bay recorded that food presentation viewed for lunch was extremely poor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">He recorded that meals were provided in plastic containers which had been raised by the management team as a very poor process for their residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">He said that comments by family or residents spoken with on the day gave rise to concern as it appeared that residents no longer have a satisfactory main meal served during the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">In relation to Gladstone, in discussions with the managers it was reported that both managers had commented that residents and family were very concerned as to the food quality and service given that all meals were now prepared and sent from Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Of the two residents with whom he spoke, both expressed their regret that the 'family' daily lunch had now been replaced with 'plastic food'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Mr Bosel expressed the opinion that unless there was a significant change in the focus of the village, that vacancy levels would continue to fall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">In relation to Earlville, Mr Bosel recorded that the new food system was to be introduced at the end of the month and 'was causing a great deal of resentment from both the residents and the management team'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">In relation to Townsville 1 --- Wulguru, it was noted that the changeover to the new system had caused similar issues to be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">In relation to Townsville 2 --- Condon, Mr Bosel reported that there was little incentive for the relief management team to increase occupancy and both had confirmed that they would not be working with the operator beyond the next few months due to the unsatisfactory changes that had occurred in the villages, particularly around the new catering arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">Mr Bosel also explained in his cross-examination that his concern about the possible adverse effect on Prime's investment in the 12 villages had been ameliorated by the fact that the food service under the Village Life System had been reintroduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">However, he said that the impact in the changeover at the time that SCV was managing was traumatic especially in relation to two villages and especially in relation to reputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">He says that he did have concerns about significant damage to the value of the villages and he reported those concerns to Mr Jaques.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">Nevertheless, he did agree with senior counsel for Fig Tree that Prime's financial reports for the half year ended December 2007 did not reflect any material loss to Prime or any loss of value in relation to the Fig Tree portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">But he went on to say that there was no mention of any material loss or value in relation to the Fig Tree portfolio at that stage because Prime did not have the valuations then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">However, it is true that there was a small amount of reduction only, in July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">The method of provision of food by SCV was a significant and serious departure from the method described under the Village Life System and which had been operated by Fig Tree prior to the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">A change of such significance without consultation with the owner of the villages, was predictably bound to cause significant repercussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">I would not infer that the food changes were insubstantial simply because Prime did not react to them earlier than it did --- nor would I infer that Prime accepted them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">In my view the changes both as to the nature of the food and the system for the delivery of food to the residents was very substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">To raise this issue for the first time in the SCV letter of 30 July 2007 and in the community summary reports sent by SCV to Prime in August 2007 was inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">I accept Prime's submission that the references in the documents were ambiguous and buried amongst other information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">As Mr Lewski observed, there was no detail and substance in the reports and he certainly did not pick up any significant impact that they may or may not have suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Prime's submission is that in fact it did not know about the nature of the food changes proposed or ultimately implemented until mid-October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">The period from mid-September to mid-October was the time at which Prime engaged the new General Manager (Aged Care &amp; Retirement Operations), Mr Bosel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">It was early October 2007 when Mr Bosel toured the Prime villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">I have previously indicated that I accept the evidence of Mr Bosel as to what he found and I also accept his denial that his tour was exclusively or predominantly for the purpose of gathering information to be used as evidence against Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">His evidence was that his initial purpose was to familiarise himself on his recent appointment with the Prime village operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">Nevertheless, of course, as the tour unfolded he became aware of and concerned about the changes to food delivery and manager's conditions which he observed and which were reported to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">He prepared reports for Mr Lewski who at that stage was overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">In those reports, Mr Bosel expressed his concerns at the standard of food service under SCV and he described the reports that he had received from managers and residents concerning the changes in food service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">It also recorded Mr Bosel's concerns arising from the change to the managers' conditions and, in particular, to the reduced financial incentives to maintain the performance of managers and occupancy at the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Fig Tree's own literature as to the importance of food unsurprisingly coincides with the importance placed on that aspect by Prime and more importantly, objectively viewed, the importance of the food system under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">The parties to the WMSAs worked on the premise that food was probably the single most important aspect of managing a Village Life site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">I have separately recorded in the confidential annexure the details which Fig Tree had focussed on in its literature on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">In light of the confidentiality, I do not propose to repeat that detail in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">In my view, the totality of the evidence called by Prime in particular does give rise to the conclusion that the nature and the impact of the changes introduced by SCV led to deep concern and dissatisfaction amongst managers and occupants of the villages concerning the reduced quantities of food (Jackson, Donnelly and Hirst); the reduced quality of the food in terms of edibility (Jackson, McLean, Donnelly and Hirst); concern at the residents' capacity to safely store and reheat the food in their units which were not designed for the purpose (evidence of Dean, Donnelly, Hodgson and Hirst); and concern at the reduction in the scope for communal dining and social interaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">I should indicate that insofar as there was a reference to safety in this aspect of the evidence, I treat that evidence only as being a departure from the previous system insofar as the location of delivery of food was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Although Fig Tree contended that such breaches would have to be established in relation to every one of the 12 villages before there could be a conclusion as to repudiation of obligations under each of the WMSAs, in my view that is not so or at least not in the sense of requiring detailed evidence to be called on all topics from all villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">The obligation contained in the Assignment Agreement for SCV to manage in accordance with the Village Life System appears to be a matter of lip service only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The reality is reflected in Fig Tree's internal documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">It was always intended that SCV would manage in accordance with its own system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">The significant impact of SCV being permitted to do that is also evident from Fig Tree's own internal documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Importantly, the evidence of Ms Kratzke and Mr Lonie was that the changes that had occurred reflected initial stages of implementing a new system that would be applied across all of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">The changes in the nature and delivery of food and in the managerial system were intended to apply at all of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">There was the following exchange with Ms Kratzke in cross-examination: 
 When SCV took over responsibility for managing aspects of the villages, you were involved in organising the roll-out, as it were, of a new system for preparing and serving food to residents in the villages which SCV was now looking after.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">Is that correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">--- 

 
 I was responsible in assisting with that roll-out, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">

 
 And you know from your role as a regional manager that roll-out was across all of the villages that SCV took responsibility for?</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">--- 

 
 Not all, no 

 
 It was intended or planned to be rolled out to at least all of the villages that Prime owned?</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">--- It was intended, yes, but that didn't occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">
 Ms Kratzke went onto explain that it did not happen at Townsville, Wulguru because the managers there did not sign the permanent employment contract with SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">She also explained that the new method for preparing and serving food to residents started to be introduced in the different villages from about the dates that the managers at each of the villages signed the new permanent employment agreements with SCV and that was typically mid to late September and then continuing through the balance of September and October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">She also explained that the new permanent employment contracts for the on-site managers under the SCV model only paid the managers for 38 hours per week per couple even though they were required to do whatever work was necessary to complete the tasks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Ms Kratzke accepted that if a manager at a village prior to, for example, May 2007 had adopted the kind of arrangements concerning food and management that applied under the SCV model, it would not have been regarded (operationally, I infer) as compliance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">Prime did not know at this time that Fig Tree was seriously disappointed with the performance of SCV; that Fig Tree expected that SCV would simply introduce its own system rather than apply the Village Life System and Prime was not aware at that stage of the extent of difficulties being occasioned by the departures that SCV were implementing from the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">Nevertheless, in my view, Prime is entitled to rely upon all matters which have now become apparent to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">That includes the matters discovered by Mr Bosel on his tour and his report, the matters unearthed in the course of discovery given by Fig Tree in the litigation as well as Prime's own preparation for the litigation in proofing managers and occupants of the villages concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">The principle flowing from Shepherd v Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359 is that the termination of an agreement may be justified by proof of circumstances existing prior to such termination but of which the party terminating the agreement was unaware of until a later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">Starke J at 373 held: 
 The fact that the appellant's misconduct was unknown to the respondent at the time of the termination of the agreement is quite immaterial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">If there were, in fact, any circumstances in existence at the time of the termination of the agreement which could have justified the respondent in so terminating it, then it may justify the termination by subsequent proof of those circumstances (Smith's Law of Master and Servant, 5th ed., p. 107; Taylor v.

<sentence id="s787">
 When applied to the circumstances under examination in this case, Prime was entitled at trial to support its actions taken on 3 October 2007 by reference to events which existed but which were not known to it at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">Although Prime must justify an election to terminate by reference to a legal right to do so it may justify it on any ground available at the time of the election: Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Co v Ansell (1888) 39 Ch D 339 ; Shepherd v Felt [1931] HCA 21 ; 45 CLR 359 ; Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd [1938] HCA 66 ; (1938) 61 CLR 286 at 305; per Latham CJ; Sunbird Plaza Pty Ltd v Maloney [1988] HCA 11 ; (1988) 166 CLR 245.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">There is no need for it to prove that at the time of the election there was knowledge of the ground which ultimately justifies the election: Thompson &amp; Morgan (UK) Ltd v Erica Vale Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 335 at 347.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">It is not restricted to that ground, Rawson v Hobbs [1961] HCA 72 ; (1961) 107 CLR 466.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">The residents were accustomed to a style of food preparation and delivery which Fig Tree itself clearly contended was of pivotal importance to the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">It was entirely foreseeable and reasonable that elderly residents as Fig Tree describes them would indeed be seriously resistant to change from a system of delivery of food upon which central importance was placed by Fig Tree in the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Whether or not there was an effective assignment or whether it be by installing SCV as its agent to manage the villages, the WMSAs were repudiated by Fig Tree by ceasing to perform all or substantially all of its management functions in the Prime villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">It did this by permitting or directly implementing new arrangements which were intended to be permanent and which were inconsistent with the Village Life System in relation to the nature and delivery of food provided to the residents and in connection with the engagement of on-site managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">Taken alone, I would not regard the changes in conditions of tenancy for residents as being a significant departure but taken with the other breaches is supportive of the conclusion that Fig Tree was renouncing or repudiating its obligations under the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">It was a renunciation in the sense described in Koompahtoo [2007] HCA 61 ; 233 CLR 115 that it evinced Fig Tree's intention to no longer be bound by the contract or to fulfil it only in a manner substantially inconsistent with obligations under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">Equally, the conduct constituted a repudiation in the sense described in Koompahtoo of each WMSA as being a sufficiently serious breach of an intermediate term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">In my view it is clear that the WMSAs cannot be assigned without the consent of Prime first being obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">The fact that the WMSAs refer to others who may replace Fig Tree has no bearing on the proper construction of the agreement on the consent point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">There is a critical difference between assigning contractual rights on the one hand and assigning contractual burdens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">There may be no need to obtain consent for the assignment of the benefit of the contract but the obligation to perform a contract can rarely be assigned without consent from the other party first being obtained ( Pacific Brand Support &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 40 ; 149 FCR 395 at [32] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">I also consider that the WMSAs are in the nature of a contract for personal performance for the reasons I have explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">The Village Life System was guarded carefully by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">It was only Fig Tree's system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">The performance of the WMSAs in accordance with the Village Life System was at the heart of the bargain constituted by the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">Fig Tree may have had the right to amend the Village Life System but the factual evidence was that it had not done so in any significant way until entry into the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">To the contrary, it had adhered to that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">The only reasonable inference is that Fig Tree believed the Village Life System to be the superior method of managing villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">Clearly Prime shared that belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Changes to the Terms and Conditions of Appointment of Managers and Terms of Residency
 The pleaded case for Prime in relation to this issue was as follows: 
 From about August 2007 SCV purported to implement new permanent arrangements concerning:
 ...
 (d) the terms and conditions on which on-site managers at each Village were engaged: 

 Particulars 

 
SCV:
 
 
(i) required on-site managers to terminate their contracts for services to [Fig Tree] and enter into contracts of service with SCV or its related entities such as SCV Group Limited;
 
 
(ii) capped the hours of work for which each on-site manager was to be paid at approximately 3 hours per day, and removed the former incentive system under which [Fig Tree] would pay bonuses to managers according to the number of occupied units in each Village;
 
 
(iii) terminated the former arrangement whereby on-site managers were provided with accommodation in an on-site manager's unit, and instead required managers to pay rent for their accommodation in such units;
 
 
(iv) required managers to use external service providers for services such as laundry, gardening and maintenance work rather than providing a budget for such services which could be used either to engage external service providers or remunerate managers or their staff for performing the work themselves, as appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">Prime further refers to and repeats the particulars as to the changed conditions regarding food preparation work set out under subparagraphs 39(a) to (c) inclusive above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">Fig Tree argues that some of the on-site managers were unhappy with the changes to their conditions because they perceived that they were being paid less to do the same job (even though they were now receiving benefits such as paid leave which they did not have before and it was not intended that they would perform certain work such as the laundry).</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Again, in my view, it was entirely foreseeable and reasonable that on-site managers would be far less satisfied with the engagement conditions and the limited amount of pay they received on the change from the Village Life System to the SCV system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Because an overwhelming number of on-site managers and residents did not give evidence about their perception of the changes, Fig Tree says this should lead to an inference that most of them were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">I would not be prepared to draw that inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">An inference of the nature described in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298 is not one that the Court must draw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">In my view, the changes to the food system in particular and to a lesser extent, the engagement system, were so obvious that one needed to hear from only a handful of people to express the entirely reasonable and foreseeable concerns about the effects of introduction of such changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">Such evidence as there was, it is said, eventuated out of the efforts of Mr Bosel who went to the villages shortly after the termination with the express goal of 'digging up dirt on Fig Tree'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">Again, I am not persuaded by the submission of Fig Tree that Mr Bosel's express denial that he was digging up dirt on Fig Tree was disingenuous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">Given the position in which he was placed and the concerns which were emerging at that stage, it would be essential to review the existing portfolio of villages in order to ascertain whether the areas of concern and non-performance by the operator would lead to a decline in value of the investment by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">There is no evidence that the changes which occurred diminished Prime's return from the properties let alone deprived Prime of substantially the whole benefit of the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">However, while this may be so, it was early days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">Prime should not be required, in my view, to stand by idly watching significant non-compliance with an aspect of the WMSAs which on any reasonable view could have the capacity to diminish the extent of occupancy in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">In relation to Townsville 2 --- Condon, Mr Bosel reported that there was little incentive for the relief management team to increase occupancy and both had confirmed that they would not be working with the operator beyond the next few months due to the unsatisfactory changes that had occurred in the villages, particularly around the new catering arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">Fig Tree contends that there is no evidence that these changes diminished the on-site managers' package.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">Although the changes may or may not have diminished the package, they became employees of SCV rather than independent contractors of Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">In that way they became entitled to statutory conditions such as paid superannuation contributions, four weeks annual leave and sick leave as well as access to relief staff during their four weeks leave and food paid for and provided by SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">Further, Fig Tree argues that the alteration of the on-site managers' package was a matter between Fig Tree/SCV and its on-site managers and only became relevant to Prime if the packages diminished the return to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">In any event according to Fig Tree, those alterations were not established as having been made prior to 3 October 2007 except in relation to Gladstone and Hervey Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">As to Hervey Bay, Fig Tree says that the change occurred just over two weeks before the date of the purported termination on 3 October 2007 and in the case of Gladstone, the change occurred barely ten days before 3 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">Fig Tree argues that there was no requirement under the Village Life System that the on-site managers be engaged on the terms pleaded relating to the number of hours for which the on-site managers would be paid or the ability to perform services such as laundry other than engage an external service provider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">If they are capable of being regarded as breaches of the WMSAs which Fig Tree does not accept, they could not be regarded on Fig Tree's argument as being breaches of such seriousness as would justify termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">I accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">In relation to the food delivery system, I have concluded that the breaches were sufficiently serious (in relation to an important intermediate term) such that taken alone, the breaches warranted termination by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">There seems to be little challenge and, in any event, I accept that it is established that the departures from the circumstances in which managers would be employed (as pleaded and set out above) was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">Fig Tree's argument is that although there were changes, there is no indication that the changes caused any damage at all to Prime and in fact that the changes may have been for the better.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">I do accept that there was departure from the Village Life System of some substance in relation to the engagement of managers but I do not consider that taken alone, the changes would constitute a sufficiently serious breach of an important or intermediate term such as to justify termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">The least serious of the three breaches of the Village Life System in my view was the change in residency arrangements in respect of occupants of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">The evidence appeared to establish that there had been a departure from previous arrangements but it could not be said on the evidence that the departure was a serious breach of the obligation to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">The breach concerning residents, taken alone would not, in my view, warrant termination of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">Affirmation --- the Principles
 Did Prime affirm the WMSAs despite Fig Tree's serious breach?</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">The elements of affirmation do not appear to be controversial ( Wallace-Smith v Thiess Infraco (Swanston) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 49 ; (2005) 218 ALR 1 at [85] - [86] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">The three elements required are: Affirmation does not depend on intention to maintain the contract, notwithstanding a breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">Rather it is '... an effect which the law annexes to conduct which would be justifiable only if an election had been made' ( Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 at 55).</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">Prime stresses that words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that it was consistent only with the exercise of one of two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other ( Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634 at 646 per Stephen J referred to with approval in Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) [1993] HCA 27 ; (1993) 182 CLR 26 at 38).</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">The consequences of election may be serious for the party electing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">Generally it involves abandoning a right that is available ( Immer at 39 per Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">These points were reiterated recently in Agricultural and Rural Finance Pty Limited v Gardiner [2008] HCA 57 ; (2008) 83 ALJR 196 at 50 and 59.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">It is also essential that to constitute an election to affirm rather than an election to accept a repudiation, the conduct must be consistent with the continued existence of the contract ( Carr v JA Berriman Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 31 ; (1953) 89 CLR 327 at 348).</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">Continued performance, however, does not constitute affirmation when there is a reservation of the rights to terminate ( Wallace-Smith [2005] FCAFC 49 ; 218 ALR 1 at [87] - [89] , [151] and [330]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">In this regard the evidence of Mr Lewski which I accept concerning the reservation of Prime's position at the 15 August 2007 meeting (albeit the meeting was with SCV not Fig Tree) is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">Where knowledge is necessary to make an election effective, it must be knowledge of facts giving rise to the right to elect not simply knowledge of the right itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Fig Tree's position appears to be that the effluxion of time establishes affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">But given the number of villages involved, the complexity of the issues, the reality is that the time concerned was relatively brief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">The first occasion on which Prime was asked by Fig Tree to make a decision was on 13 September 2007 when Prime received replacement WMSAs and was asked to sign them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">Prime at that time was never confronted with the opportunity to choose between two alternatives before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">Even if this were not so, mere delay alone cannot constitute conduct sufficient to amount to an affirmation: Ellison v Lutre Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 399 ; (1999) 88 FCR 116 at [55] per von Doussa, Mansfield and Goldberg JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">It is an important consideration, in my view, that delay alone cannot 'itself constitute conduct sufficient to amount to affirmation': Ellison at [55] per von Doussa, Mansfield and Goldberg JJ referring to Elders Trustee &amp; Executor Co Ltd v Commonwealth Homes &amp; Investment Co Ltd [1941] HCA 31 ; (1941) 65 CLR 603 at 618 and Sargent [1974] HCA 40 ; 131 CLR 634 at 656.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">See also Hoy at 226 per Rares J and The Law of Rescission (O'Sullivan et al, Oxford University Press, 2008) at 23.55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">The non-defaulting party is certainly entitled to time within which to decide what its response will be to the breach of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">Nothing prior to September 2007 started time running from Prime's perspective for the purposes of any delay assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">Prime contends in this regard that nothing about its conduct unequivocally or even on the balance of impressions conveyed its approval of an assignment of the kind that Fig Tree in fact proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">There was no Affirmation on the Evidence
 Prime says further that in light of the limited information or knowledge it had about the practical ramifications of the SCV system rather than the Village Life System, nothing in its conduct was or was ever taken by Fig Tree as being a communication of Prime's agreement to any assignments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">Nothing about Prime's conduct unequivocally or even on the balance of impressions conveyed its approval of an assignment of the kind Fig Tree had conditionally implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">On the affirmation case, Fig Tree contends that the evidence of Mr Lewski should be rejected unless it is corroborated by other reliable evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">According to Fig Tree, not only was there no corroboration of Mr Lewski's evidence in relation to reserving Prime's position but it was not supported by the only objective evidence as to what occurred at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Fig Tree places reliance on Mr Buckner's notes and the letter sent the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">If it is not already clear, in my view, neither of these documents displaces the evidence of Mr Lewski as to reserving Prime's position, which evidence I accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">The topic may not have been an issue which Mr Buckner thought was of particular concern to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">It may have been an issue which Mr Buckner sought not to highlight in his notes or the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">He cannot recall what was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">I also do not accept Fig Tree's argument that it was unnecessary to put to Mr Lewski that his evidence about reserving the position of Prime was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">I do accept the legal submission that if the witness is otherwise generally impugned, that it is not necessary to put every single proposition of falsity to the witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">The test is one of fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">The reservation of rights point, in my view, was such a significant point, that Mr Lewski should have been tested on it if it was proposed to contend as Fig Tree have now done that much of Mr Lewski's evidence should be rejected as he was an unreliable witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">Fig Tree also argues that even if the reservation of rights in the terms it was described by Mr Lewski was made, it is a very narrow statement and applied only to the proposed future conduct of Prime's consent for assignment being sought by Fig Tree or SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">Fig Tree contends that no reservation was made about the conduct which had occurred before 15 August 2007 or about the changes of which Mr Lewski and Mr Jaques were aware.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">Fig Tree contends that the reason no reservation was made was because they have by their conduct at that stage communicated affirmation in relation to those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">I do not accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">In my view there is no evidence to support the contention that there was unequivocal conduct of Prime constituting affirmation with knowledge of the facts said to constitute the repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">This is for two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">First, there was not sufficient knowledge at that stage to constitute affirmation and secondly, there was simply no unequivocal conduct affirming the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">Fig Tree contends that the evidence of Mr Lewski in relation to the reservation of Prime's position rested on the foundation of Mr Lewski's 'false evidence' that the alleged conversation with Mr Roberts from SCV was 'the first time anyone had directly told (Mr Lewski) of Fig Tree's intention to seek an assignment of the WMSAs'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">I do not accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">Fig Tree submits that Mr Lewski's statement that '... the first time anyone had directly told me of Fig Tree's intention to seek an assignment of the WMSAs' is a 'ridiculous one' and 'utterly inconsistent with the objective evidence', in particular, 'the final PDS and its various previous iterations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">I do not accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">The evidence given by Mr Lewski was of being 'directly' informed of Fig Tree's intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">While it is true that the professional advisors made reference to assignment in the PDS which he approved, I take Mr Lewski's evidence on this topic to mean that no one from Fig Tree had directly told him of the intention to seek an assignment of WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">That indeed is what he said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">There is no evidence inconsistent with such a statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">When it is understood in that way, the evidence is entirely plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Fig Tree also attacks Mr Lewski in relation to his understanding following the 15 August 2007 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">Specifically, Fig Tree point to the evidence of Mr Lewski that it did not occur to him following the 15 August 2007 meeting that SCV would change the way in which the villages were operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">Referring to his state of mind at 13 September 2007 (almost a month later), he said that he 'did not realise that SCV Group also proposed to change the village arrangements regarding how food was to be prepared, the terms and roles of the on-site managers ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">Fig Tree contends that these propositions cannot stand given Mr Lewski's 'concessions' during cross-examination that he had received, prior to the 15 August 2007 meeting, the community summary reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">However, this overlooks the fact that the community summary reports both in the view of Mr Lewski and in objective fact did not descend to the detail in relation to the breaches of which Prime complains and their effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">Mr Lewski said that the 13 September 2007 letter was the first correspondence which made him think that Fig Tree intended no longer to perform the WMSAs and that it confirmed to him that SCV had been in operational control for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">Fig Tree contends that these statements are 'utterly disingenuous' when compared with the objective evidence of the final PDS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">In my view, once again, Fig Tree misses the point which has been made by Mr Lewski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">It is a big leap from the minor disclosure on which Fig Tree seizes to a clear revelation of the matters which constituted the breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">Mr Lewski himself, in my view, clarified these matters and not in a manner as contended for by Fig Tree which was 'unintelligible' although I do accept that it was slightly confusing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">He said: 
 ... What I mean to say there is that is the first instance in which evidence of how the operational changes had been implemented at the villages became that I became aware from the feedback that I got from Bosel, who undertook visitations to the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">(emphasis added) 
 Once again, Mr Lewski is focussing on the manner of implementation of the operational changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">It was reports as to the actual manner of implementation which was also the subject of complaint by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">Mr Lewski repeated this again in a different way in cross-examination speaking about the middle of October being the first realisation of what was ' physically being implemented in the Fig Tree villages operationally ' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">I reject Fig Tree's submission that Mr Lewski's evidence should only be accepted if it is relevantly corroborated by other reliable evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">Mr Lewski did not profess a perfect memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">Nor did he present as an advocate for Prime's cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">His evidence was plausible and in my view, candid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">Similar attacks were made on Mr Bosel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">Again, I consider that Mr Bosel, like Mr Lewski, gave credible and plausible evidence which I accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">Fig Tree pleaded affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">Fig Tree, accordingly, has the onus of proving it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">The onus of demonstrating that the non-defaulting party is precluded from relying on the breach to terminate the contract rests on the party that is in default --- Cockerill v Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 227 at 279 per Cooper J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">My view is that Prime never had sufficient knowledge to be put upon its election; that it was never confronted with two inconsistent alternatives; that it never unequivocally adopted the WMSAs by its own actions; and that it never communicated any affirmation of the WMSAs notwithstanding the breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">The Extent of Prime's knowledge
 As to knowledge, however, something more should be said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">Fig Tree relies on a chain of documents in the months leading up to the purported termination by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">It says those documents taken together clearly demonstrate that Prime had sufficient knowledge to be put upon its election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">I have also indicated why I do not believe that is so but insofar as knowledge is concerned, it is not sufficient in my view for Fig Tree to say that Prime's witnesses should not be believed and a Jones v Dunkel inference should be drawn in relation to those whom it did not call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">Even in relation to knowledge, the onus is on the party in default who relies on the pleaded affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">The innocent contracting party must be 'confronted' with two mutually exclusive courses of action between which it must in fairness to the delinquent party make a choice --- Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810 at [224] - [225] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">There cannot be a confrontation of that nature unless the innocent party has knowledge on which to elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">It has been said that the quality of that knowledge must be 'full knowledge' --- Sargent [1974] HCA 40 ; 131 CLR 634 at 642.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">The majority of the High Court said in Immer (No 145) [1993] HCA 27 ; 182 CLR 26 at 39 that 'the consequences of election may well be serious for the party electing; in particular, election involves the abandoning of a right that is available'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">Knowledge is required not only of the facts but of the circumstances surrounding the facts: Sargent at 642.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">It has also been said election is not to be lightly inferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">Rares J in Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 810 at [257] indicated that there must be 'full and frank disclosure' before a party can be put in a position where an election was necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">While Prime does not advance a case that Fig Tree has not been frank in its disclosure, it has certainly pointed to significant matters of which Fig Tree was aware but which were not conveyed to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">They are matters of which Prime was not aware and matters of which Prime would need to be aware in order to have the necessary knowledge in order to elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">Communication
 Finally, there was clearly no communication of an unequivocal act constituting an affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">The proper inference on the evidence from Fig Tree's own perspective was that it would not have treated Prime as having actually communicated its approval until it had signed the WMSAs enclosed in the 13 September 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">This evidence was contained in the cross-examination of Mr Dubery but quite plainly there was no act which could clearly constitute communication of the affirmation at any point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">At no time prior to late September 2007 did Prime have knowledge of the true nature of the changes contemplated by the Assignment Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">During June and July it was told that legal documentation would be provided later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">The documents were in fact provided in late September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">The documents reveal that Prime was expected to contract with SCV with whom it never proposed to bargain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">RELIEF SOUGHT BY FIG TREE AND PRIME 
 The preceding conclusions do not fully resolve the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">I have concluded that Prime's complaint in part is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">Fig Tree asserts and seeks a declaration that Prime's media release to the ASX on 4 October 2007 was misleading and deceptive conduct in trade and commerce in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">While that assertion might be considered to fail if the repudiation argument is made good, it is still necessary to examine the actual complaint about and content of, the media release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">This is to be done against a background of my conclusions on repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">It is necessary to examine the text of the media release which Prime forwarded to the ASX on 4 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">The media release was in these terms: 
 Prime Trust owns 12 retirement style properties that are subject to individual 20 year Wholesale Management Services Agreements ("WMSA") with Village Life Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">These properties represent a relatively small component (circa 6%) of gross income flows to Prime Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">Earlier this year Village Life Ltd announced it had sold its management rights to SCV Group Ltd and shortly thereafter SCV Group Ltd announced that it had taken operational control of these premises .</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">

 
 Following advice from senior counsel, the Responsible Entity on behalf of Prime Trust has advised Village Life Ltd that it does not have the power to assign its rights and responsibilities in each WMSA without Prime Trust's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">It is not the intention of Prime Trust to consent to the assignment and we consider each WMSA to be repudiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">

 
 Prime Trust emphasizes that this matter will have no adverse consequences for the existing residents of the properties; for them it is business as usual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">Similarly, no adverse impact on returns to Prime Trust unitholders from this action is anticipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">(emphasis added) 
 Fig Tree complains that the media release represented expressly or by implication that: 
(a) it had sold or transferred the management rights under the WMSAs to SCV unconditionally;
 
(b) it had sold or transferred the management rights under the WMSAs to SCV without seeking the consent of Prime; 
 
(c) that Fig Tree was no longer involved in the management of the villages; and
 
(d) that Fig Tree had repudiated the WMSAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">There is a merger of two concepts in the complaints raised by Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">One is the complaint that the media release wrongly suggests that there was a repudiation by an unconditional assignment agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">I have already held that entry into the Assignment Agreement alone was not, in my view, a repudiation because on a proper construction of the Assignment Agreement, it was subject to obtaining the consent of Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">While I recognise that Prime advances an argument that under the Assignment Agreement Fig Tree was implicitly obliged to assign the rights in any event whether or not consent was obtained, I do not accept that this is the better construction of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">As indicated, in my view, there was an obligation for Fig Tree to use its reasonable best endeavours to obtain Prime's consent but it is most unlikely that SCV would have considered itself bound to proceed with the Assignment Agreement if the consent was not obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">However, insofar as the media release is concerned, I do not believe that it does suggest that Fig Tree assigned its rights and responsibilities without obtaining consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">First, it refers to Fig Tree making an announcement of its sale of rights and then it refers to Prime informing Fig Tree that it could not do so without obtaining consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">It then says that Prime will not consent and it goes on to say 'we consider each WMSA to be repudiated'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">All of that is correct until the last quoted portion which is clearly a statement of opinion in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">But it would be artificial to assert that the media release represents that by entry into the Assignment Agreement alone, without first obtaining consent, was a repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">The emphasised words '... and shortly thereafter SCV Group Ltd announced that it had taken operational control of those premises', make it clear that the release as a whole and taken in context is directed to the actual events at the villages, not simply the sale of rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">It was true that SCV had taken operational control, it was true that SCV made an announcement to that effect and significantly, it was the taking of operational control by SCV, that is to say, by Fig Tree relinquishing operational control (particularly in relation to the food component of the Village Life System) to SCV which constituted the repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">It was the practical operational control being relinquished by Fig Tree to SCV in a manner which failed to ensure that the villages would be managed on an ongoing basis in accordance with the Village Life System which constituted a renunciation or a repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">Accordingly, the content of the media release was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">FURTHER ALTERNATIVE RELIEF SOUGHT BY PRIME - SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 
 Prime argues alternatively, if Fig Tree is held not to have repudiated the WMSAs and is further to be entitled to remain as manager, the WMSAs do require it to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">Prime seeks an order for specific performance to enforce that requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Prime argues that Fig Tree must be held to the terms of the WMSAs and be required to reinstate all of the arrangements which were presented as constituting the Village Life System prior to July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">The same factual issues are reiterated in support of this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">In this context, it is irrelevant that Fig Tree in February 2008 purported to 'take back' or 'resume' its management of the villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">As was held by Barwick CJ in Ogle v Comboyuro Investments Pty Ltd [1976] HCA 21 ; (1976) 136 CLR 444 at 452-453, a repudiation cannot unilaterally be withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">The Chief Justice followed that observation with the remark that only a consensual act could do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">In relation to the order for specific performance which is sought by Prime, Fig Tree contends that such an order should not be made because: 
(a) it is a dangerous one because of the practical implications which would flow from it;
 
(b) there would be difficulties for Fig Tree in knowing what would be required by it by reason of such an order; and
 
(c) it is not the relief which is sought by Prime in its cross claim nor is there any factual or any legal foundation for such relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">In support of these contentions Fig Tree says that Prime, in seeking that the pre-July 2007 practices be reinstated and remain in place for some 20 years is seeking a dangerously unrealistic order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Fig Tree says that it may be presumed that there will be changes to health and hygiene issues, food service and other aspects of managing a retirement style village in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Some of those changes may be imposed by legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">Others may arise because of an increased knowledge and understanding in the areas of medicine and food research, especially nutrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">Further, as it is entitled to do, Fig Tree argues, Fig Tree itself might determine that modifications to the Village Life System will improve the services it can offer Prime as manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">Prime's order proposes that Fig Tree not be permitted to modify the Village Life System to take into account any of those matters and remain fixed for the next 20 years in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">Fig Tree contends that such an order would be dangerous because it would have the capacity to expose Fig Tree to penalties or, indeed, to expose residents to health risks that could have been avoided had Fig Tree not been so restricted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">Secondly, such an order for specific performance would give rise to uncertainty on the part of Fig Tree as to precisely what would be permitted and what would not be permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">Would it be permitted to modify the Village Life System at all in accordance with the existing WMSAs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Fig Tree argues that a good example of uncertainty which Fig Tree would face arises in relation to the conditions of tenancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Fig Tree argues that a critical deficiency in Prime's approach to the application for specific performance lies in the lack of articulation of the practices which it says must be reinstated and must remain in force for the duration of each WMSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">Although it is unnecessary to resolve the issue in light of my conclusion that Fig Tree has repudiated the WMSAs, if I am wrong on that conclusion, I record that I would accept Fig Tree's submissions and I would not have ordered specific performance for the reasons advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 As an additional defence to Fig Tree's claim, Prime raised in closing arguments an argument that the announcement it made to the ASX was conduct in relation to financial services and thus excluded from the operation of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) by virtue of s 51AAB of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">As the media statement by Prime was, as I have found, accurate, it is unnecessary to consider this additional defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">CONCLUSION 
 Although Fig Tree asserts that the benefit for which Prime contracted was simply the benefit of earning rental income in the villages (and terminating if occupancy fell below a certain level), I disagree with that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">In the recitals to each of the WMSAs, Prime's objective is recorded as being to obtain the benefit of maximising the return on its investment by having each village managed under the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">This passage makes it clear, objectively, that Prime made a decision to contract with Fig Tree because it would manage in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">It chose to do that not simply to ensure that rental income would not fall below the minimum level at which it could terminate but rather to ' maximise the return on its investment ' by having the villages managed under the Village Life System (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">By causing the significant changes to the food delivery services to be implemented, Fig Tree manifested an intention, regardless of the terms of the Assignment Agreement to no longer be bound by its obligations under the WMSAs to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">Fig Tree's conduct in practically handing over the management of these food services to SCV amounted to a serious breach of an important intermediate term (to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System).</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">Insofar as delivery of food to residents in the villages was concerned, the breach of the obligation to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System was a serious breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">It was a serious breach of an intermediate or innominate term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">This conduct entitled Prime to treat Fig Tree's breach as constituting a repudiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">Its acceptance of the repudiation and thus terminating the contract was justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">My analysis of the facts as presented by the evidence is that whatever the contractual obligations under the Assignment Agreement, Fig Tree in reality was simply walking away from its obligation to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">It was handing over control to SCV in a manner which precluded Fig Tree having any practical ability to deliver management of the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">Because the Assignment Agreement required Prime's consent to the assignment, entry into the Assignment Agreement taken alone, was not the renunciation but walking away from its obligations after entry into the Assignment Agreement and before the consent of Prime was obtained and in a manner in which no capacity to deliver management in accordance with the Village Life System was maintained, indicated an intention to no longer be bound by the obligation under the WMSAs to manage the villages in accordance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">Accordingly, Prime is entitled to the declaratory relief it seeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">Fig Tree's claim must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">I will make the following orders: Confidentiality Order: 
(a) The Confidential Annexure to these reasons is to be available to Judges of this Court and to the parties but otherwise is not to be copied or reproduced by any of the parties or their legal representatives ('advisers') save to the extent necessary for the purposes of considering and/or conducting an appeal.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1004">(c) The parties have liberty to apply within 21 days to vary the terms of these confidentiality orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">The application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">The cross-claim is allowed in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">
 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 The respondent, Prime, was entitled to and did lawfully accept the conduct of the cross-respondent, Fig Tree and Fig Tree's agents and subcontractors as a repudiation of the Wholesale Management Services Agreements made between Prime and Fig Tree and that the Wholesale Management Services Agreements are accordingly terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">Unless any other order is made within six weeks, and subject to receipt of written submissions from the parties to be filed and served within 21 days, the applicant is to pay the costs of the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Orders 2, 3 and 4 be stayed for a period of 14 days.</sentence>

 APPENDIX A --- RULINGS
FIG TREE'S OBJECTIONS 
 Fig Tree's objections and the Court's rulings were as follows: References Fig Tree's objection Prime's concession or answer Fig Tree's reply RULING Brenda Jackson 
 
 
 
 The whole Relevance in relation to the 11 other WMSAs than the WMSA in respect of Christie Downs Fig Tree's evidence established that the procedures before, during and after SCV were "systems" applied across all Villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">Witness gives direct evidence of operation of the system in one Village: provides a basis for inference as to operation of system generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">Objection withdrawn Ruling unnecessary Paragraph 3 Relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">Breach of the hearsay rule as to the 3 rd sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">Relevant to establish importance of food service (see also eg., Independent Contractors' Manual, Module 8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Not hearsay: direct evidence of making of statement, not relied on as evidence of truth of the contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">Objection maintained The statement that Village residents would be provided with three fresh meals each day and all their laundry would be done cannot be evidence as to the truth of the statement being hearsay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">The fact that the statement was made nevertheless can be admitted as going to the importance of the food service to a resident and to the managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">That is capable of being relevant to the seriousness of any breach and/or the importance of the term requiring compliance with the Village Life System.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">Paragraph 8 Impermissible means of the proof of the contents of documents; Breach of the opinion rule in relation to the operation of a contract; relevance Strike second sentence Second sentence is struck out by consent
Objection is maintained to remainder of paragraph; no submission has been made by Prime to support admission of remainder of paragraph Objection upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">The second sentence has been struck out by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">The balance of the paragraph is simply an expression of a state of mind, belief or opinion which is neither admissible or relevant.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1025">Direct evidence of reading and source of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">Objection maintained The objection is upheld on the basis that it is secondary evidence of the contents of a document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">The brochures are in evidence and it is an obvious inference that they are used to promote the services which Village Life were offering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">Whether those services include the services to which the witness deposes is simply a matter of reading the document.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1033">The views are on the topic of the consequences of the alleged breach.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1040">The opinion on the quality of the food and the consequences of the food which was served, in my view, can be expressed by a village manager who is the person charged with the responsibility of that issue.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1045">Objection is maintained other than in relation to hearsay evidence; no submission has been made by Prime to support admission of evidence The hearsay objection having been withdrawn, the objection on the basis of opinion will be disallowed for reasons previously expressed concerning par 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">As to the material referring to un-named residents leaving because they had researched unidentified media reports relating to SCV, there is an objection on the grounds of relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">Given the identification of that particular topic within par 9, the passage '... and also because of media reports relating to SCV which they had researched.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">' will be struck out of par 9 on the grounds that it is not relevant to any pleaded issue.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1059">Paragraph 11, from the words "On or around 3 September 2007" onwards Relevance Relevant to show Fig Tree conduct in transferring responsibilities (including responsibility for engagement of managers) to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">Objection maintained The passage 'On or around 3 September 2007' onwards contains material which is irrelevant to the pleaded issues except to the extent that it establishes that Fig Tree had transferred management responsibilities, specifically the responsibility for the engagement of managers to SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">However, as that is well established by other evidence including Fig Tree's own evidence, I would allow the objection on the grounds of relevance.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1063">Strike out last two sentences of paragraph 12 Last two sentences of paragraph 12 struck out by consent.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1065">I would have allowed the objection in relation to that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">As to the balance of these paragraphs, Prime has made no submission to support the admission of the remainder of the material in par 12 or in pars 13-22.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1078">There is no obvious hearsay as such.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1090">Arguably it is in Ron's and my interest to allow occupancy levels to decrease as we will need to do less work to earn our weekly salary, however, I believe that it is important for the morale and culture of the village that it remain full'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">
 Although in my view, it is permissible for the manager who is in charge of the village to express an opinion about the nature of services supplied, this particular evidence is essentially comment or argument.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1093">Paragraphs 29 - 32 Relevance Relevant: see eg., Prime Defence par.39(d) at particulars (iv) Objection maintained The objection in relation to par 29-32 is that it is not relevant to a pleaded issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">Technically, in my view, the evidence is relevant to pleaded issues specifically the Prime defence at par 39(d), particular (iv).</sentence>

 Mr Alan Ludlow --- the Whole Affidavit 
 Fig Tree objects to the whole of the evidence of Mr Alan Ludlow on the grounds of relevance - s 56(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (Evidence Act) --- and a breach of the opinion rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">It is asserted that the whole of the affidavit seeks to prove the existence of facts about the existence of which the opinion was expressed (s 76 of the Evidence Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">Mr Ludlow is a senior valuer engaged on behalf of Prime to provide an independent expert opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">I disallow the objection on the grounds of relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">While it is true that Prime is not claiming damages, the question of the materiality or importance of the compliance with the Village Life System is central to the question of whether, if there is a departure from that system, the departure constitutes a repudiation of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">Mr Ludlow's evidence goes to the question of whether or not the events which are said to have taken place at the various villages are significant or otherwise to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">I would accept that it is not open to an expert ordinarily to base his opinion on hearsay information received as a result of discussions held at the various villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">However, if the content of those discussions is otherwise proved in evidence, then it is open to him to express a view in relation to those facts on the assumption that the facts exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">I do not consider that Mr Ludlow's expert evidence can be taken as being evidence of facts which underlie the opinion in any way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">The facts which were put to Mr Ludlow, hypothetically for his opinion were the facts pleaded by Prime in pars 39(a)-(f) of Prime's further amended defence and cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">Mr Ludlow has not purported to prove that those facts have existed but he has expressed a view as to whether those changes would have a bearing upon the capacity of a retirement village to attract and retain residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">It is open to Mr Ludlow to express those views as an expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">The objection is disallowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">In doing so I make clear that I do not regard anything Mr Ludlow has said as constituting evidence of facts as distinct from expressing a view based on the assumption that the pleaded changes occurred.</sentence>

 Ruling on document 'MFI A5' --- the 15 August 2008 meeting notes
 Mr Minett is the National Business Manager for SCV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">There are common directors between SCV and SCV No 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">The records of the two companies are held in the same location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">Mr Minett was subpoenaed to produce documents pertaining to Prime concerning the matters at issue in this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">On 28 July 2008 he produced a document entitled 'SunnyCove file memo conference Prime Trust' dated 15 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">Various initials appear on the top of the file memo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">The file memo has been marked for identification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">Mr Minett confirmed that the file memo was taken from a file called Prime Trust which is located in SCV's central office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">He was unable to identify the handwriting on the document (subsequently it has been identified).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">Fig Tree seeks to tender the document pursuant to s 48(e)(i) of the Evidence Act as a part of business records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">The tender of the document is opposed for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that there is nothing on the face of the document which would indicate that its content was communicated to anyone, let alone to Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">It is submitted for Prime that the document could quite as easily be some internal notes of topics which the unidentified author was considering raising but never raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">As against that, Fig Tree point to the content of a letter which is in evidence dated 16 August 2007, the date after the file memo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">That letter is from Christopher Bassett, Chief Operations Officer of SCV (which embraces SunnyCove) and is addressed to Mr Lewski at the Prime Retirement &amp; Aged Care Property Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">The letter reads: 
 Dear Bill 

 
 Following yesterdays discussions please find the following information as requested; 

 Residential Tenancy Agreement --- Village Life 
 
 ... 

 Report on Elizabeth Vale 2 
The letter continues:
 
 I am reliably informed that an electronic version of this report may have already been forwarded on to you so please disregard if this is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">
 Senior counsel for Fig Tree points to the fact that the statement concerning the electronic version of the report is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">The letter continues: 
 In relation to the Toowoomba visit we hope to walk this site sometime Friday morning the 17 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">

 
 We are currently costing out the retro fit of kitchens for resident units and will advise as soon as this information is received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">

 
 Mark has advised that he will liaise with you directly regarding the various other points raised with you in yesterdays' meeting as some of these will form dialogue with Mike Gordon as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">

 
 Bill, please do not hesitate to contact me directly should you require any further information relating to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">... 
 The letter in evidence purports to be have been copied to Kim Jaques and Mark Roberts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">The initials at the top of the file memo include MR (consistent with Mark Roberts) CB (consistent with Christopher Bassett) GB, J and D. It also refers to Kim Jaques (to whom the 16 August letter was copied) and Bill (consistent with the addressee of the 16 August letter).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">The file memo also notes in its first line, consistent with the 16 August letter 'sample copy of tenancy agreements to Prime Trust'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">It also notes on the first page of the memo 'Eliz Vale, 1 Report to Prime Trust'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">In the case of a business record, authenticity may be proved in different ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">It may be proven by the evidence of a person who participates in the conduct of the business and who compiled the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">Authentication is straightforward in the case of an author who is called, but in this instance the author is not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">On the other hand, there is other evidence and in particular there is the evidence of the 16 August 2007 letter the contents of which are consistent with the notes contained in the file memo being prepared by an officer of SunnyCove.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">I am satisfied that the record is a legitimate business record for the purpose of s 48(e)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">In expressing that view, I express no view as to the probative value of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">The observations as to the parallels between the file memo and the letter sent the following day are drawn upon only in order to establish authenticity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">As observed by Austin J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 ; (2005) 216 ALR 320 at [131] once such documents are adduced in evidence it is open for the defendants (as they were in that case) to show that they have no probative value, for example, by establishing that they were drafts not acted upon or that they were based on assumptions or scenarios not widely held within the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">As observed by Austin J, the law does not overload the authenticity requirement by including within it an obligation for the tendering party to rebut all such possibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">Issues going to the ultimate probative value of the documents cannot be assessed and do not bear on authentication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">MFI A5 will become exhibit 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">Ruling --- Report of Professor Sandra Capra - 30 July 2008
 Professor Sandra Capra is a Professor of Nutrition in the Faculty of Health and Science at the University of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">It is accepted that the Professor is a highly qualified nutritionist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">Objection, however, is taken to parts of the contents of a report which she has prepared on instructions from Fig Tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">Objections were taken to a number of paragraphs on several grounds but predominantly objection is on the ground of relevance and expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">As to expertise, s 79 of the Evidence Act entitles a person who has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience to express opinions on matters substantially based on that knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">Prime says that the Professor's opinions are not based on specialised training or expertise, that her opinions extend beyond her area of expertise and are not, in some instances, relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">The Professor's experience is extensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">Apart from her formal qualifications, the Professor has supervised the professional practices for food service management for 20 years in numerous facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">The thrust of the Professor's evidence is to comment upon the different types of food service systems, how they are described and how they are implemented and how certain expressions are used in the industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">It is not uncommon in technical fields for words which may have a common meaning in ordinary usage to take on a more particular meaning within that industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">Whether or not the views so expressed by the Professor will ultimately establish this is a different question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">In my view she is qualified to express the views on those topics which are set out in her report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">As to the objection on the basis of relevance, one of the issues in dispute is whether Fig Tree has breached its obligation to implement the Village Life System in relation to the provision of food and food services at the villages owned by Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">There are several issues such as whether there is a breach, whether it is a serious breach, what is the nature of the term which has been breached and what are the legal consequences which follow from a combination of some or all of those factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">It is clear from the pleadings and the cross-examination that Prime wishes to emphasise both the practical and legal importance of compliance with the Village Life System in the context of food services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">The evidence of the Professor in my view is relevant to the issue of the degree of compliance that was necessary and the degree of compliance and manner of performance which might in a practical setting be reasonably expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">The proper construction of the contract will always be a matter for the Court but I consider her evidence on those topics may be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">The weight to be attached to it will be a matter for submission in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">
