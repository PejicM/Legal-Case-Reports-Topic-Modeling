<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal against an order of the Federal Magistrates Court of 25 July 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal in connection with refusal of a protection (class XA) visa under s 65 of the Migration Act 195 8 (Cth) ( SZHWI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1025).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Under s 36(2) of the Act the criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is (relevantly) a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol (meaning, in accordance with s 5(1) , the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Section 474 of the Act protects "privative clause decisions" (defined to include decisions with respect to protection visas) from challenge other than on the grounds of jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">When the matter was called for hearing this morning the appellant did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Minister sought summary dismissal of the appeal under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which permits summary dismissal if an appellant fails to appear at a hearing relating to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In support the Minister tendered two letters (one from the Court Registry dated 8 January 2009 and one from the Minister's solicitors dated 4 February 2009) notifying the appellant of the hearing and advising of the possible consequences of a failure to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I am satisfied that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the appellant's failure to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I am also satisfied that, in any event, the documents relating to the appeal do not disclose any jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">My reasons are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant is a citizen of Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He arrived in Australia on 6 June 2005 and applied for a protection visa on 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Minister's delegate refused the application on 1 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of this refusal on 6 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal affirmed the decision on 9 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This Court, on an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court, quashed the Tribunal's decision by orders dated 15 June 2007 and remitted the application for review to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Tribunal conducted a further hearing and affirmed the decision under review on 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The appellant again appealed to the Federal Magistrates Court and that Court dismissed the appellant's claim on 25 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 13 November 2008 this Court, pursuant to an application for leave to extend time, permitted the appellant to file an appeal against the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The appellant's notice of appeal to this Court specifies three grounds which may be summarised as follows: - (i) the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider the serious nature of the appellant's claims of errors by the Tribunal, (ii) the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider the effect of the appellant's employment at the Nepalese Embassy in Thailand given that the Maoists are presently in power in Nepal, and (iii) the Tribunal failed to consider the appellant's status as the parent of a child who had been kidnapped and asked to pay a donation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The second ground of appeal may be rejected immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Federal Magistrates Court dealt with (and thus considered) the appellant's claim that his previous employment in an "esteemed position by the Royal Nepalese Embassy" meant that he would be persecuted on return to Nepal by the new Maoist regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Insofar as this second ground related to a new Maoist government, the Federal Magistrates Court said: 
 [48] To the extent that what is stated in Ground Three seeks to assert that the Maoists "have now formed a government in coalition" in Kathmandu, this was not a claim made before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It was open to the Tribunal to proceed on the only independent evidence in this regard available to it (that is, evidence as at the date of the making of its decision).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">If events in Nepal have subsequently changed in this regard (and the Court is aware of current and recent media reports concerning the formation of a new government in Nepal, and its move from a monarchy to a republic) then such events post date the Tribunal's decision and do not assist in revealing jurisdictional error on its part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">

 
 [49] It may be that such events may be relevant in other contexts, and may be of assistance to the applicant in relation to the Minister considering exercising his powers available under ss 48B or 417 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">But they do not assist the applicant in the current proceedings before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">

 Sections 48B and 417 of the Act, referred to by the Federal Magistrates Court, empower the Minister to make certain decisions in favour of an applicant for a protection visa (despite other provisions of the Act) if satisfied it is in the public interest to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I agree with the conclusion of the Federal Magistrates Court that the appellant's claims about the circumstances in Nepal that postdate the Tribunal's decision cannot found any claim of error by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Insofar as this second ground related to the appellant's position at the Nepalese Embassy and potential profile in Nepal, the Federal Magistrates Court (at [39] to [47]) identified the way in which the Tribunal had dealt with this claim and concluded that the appellant sought an impermissible review of the Tribunal's findings on the merits (namely, that the appellant's position would not mean that the appellant had such a profile as to give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution as claimed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I agree with this analysis, as well as the Court's observations in these paragraphs rejecting the appellant's claims about the Tribunal concluding that the appellant could relocate to India or Kathmandu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">As the primary judge said, the Tribunal considered that the appellant would live in Kathmandu if he returned to Nepal and that there was not a real chance of persecution for a reason relating to the 1951 Convention if he did so (being findings open on the material available to the Tribunal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The first ground must also be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court disclose a comprehensive assessment of the appellant's claims of error by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Those reasons also show that the Federal Magistrates Court did not limit itself to the grounds on which the appellant relied but also considered (at [50] to [55]) whether the Tribunal complied with its obligations under s 425 of the Act ("The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review") and to give the appellant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The third ground claims that the Tribunal was bound to consider the appellant's status as the parent of a child who had been kidnapped and asked to pay a donation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal's reasons for its decision of 31 October 2007 disclose that the appellant attended the further hearing and gave evidence about, amongst other things, the kidnapping of his son which prompted the appellant to move his family to Kathmandu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal noted inconsistencies in the appellant's claims about the abduction and concluded that it was not satisfied it had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Tribunal, having regard to the material available to it, did not accept that the appellant would come to the attention of Maoists if he returned to Kathmandu by reason of the alleged abduction (which it also did not accept occurred) or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Hence, while the Tribunal accepted that the appellant may come within a social group of Nepalese who have lived and worked overseas there was no factual basis for the Tribunal to consider any alleged social group of parents of children who had been kidnapped and asked for a ransom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It follows that the third ground of appeal cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In summary, I agree with the following conclusion of the Federal Magistrates Court: 
 [55] In all, the issue on which the Tribunal's decision turned was the adverse credibility findings made in relation to some aspects of his claims to fear harm, and second, his ability to return safely to live in Kathmandu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On either the Tribunal's decision record, or either of the two transcripts before the Court, it is clear that the Tribunal put both issues to the applicant at the hearing, thereby enabling him to address those issues and provide explanations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In this regard, I am satisfied that the Tribunal fulfilled its obligations pursuant to s 425 of the Act, and its obligation in relation to procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

 
 Conclusion 
 [56] In all, I cannot discern jurisdictional error as it is said to arise from the grounds stated in the application, nor otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">For the applicant to succeed in this application before the Court, such error would have to be discerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In these circumstances, the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

 For the above reasons the appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Minister sought a fixed costs order in the sum of $3,452 based on the affidavit of Colin Thorpe, solicitor, sworn 9 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I consider that such an order should also be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jagot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Associate:
