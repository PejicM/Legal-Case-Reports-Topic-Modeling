 CONSENT ORDERS 
 On 15 December 2009, at the hearing of the application in this proceeding, I made the following orders by consent of the parties: The respondent (Wilson), from October 2007 to June 2008, in trade or commerce, falsely represented that its mobile security patrol services (Patrol Services) were of a particular standard, quality, value or grade, in contravention of section 53(aa) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Act) by representing to each of the 322 Customers listed (Customers) in column A of the attached schedule (Schedule) that Wilson had made the number of security inspections (Calls) that it had contracted to make, or had represented that it would make to that Customer's premises in a particular month and which are specified in column E of the Schedule (Contracted Calls), save for any Calls that were missed due to break-ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities (Permitted Missed Calls), when in fact, during the relevant month: 
(a) Wilson made the number of Calls specified in the corresponding row of column F of the Schedule (Actual Calls) to the premises of the Customers specified in the corresponding row of column B of the Schedule; 
(b) the Actual Calls fell short of the Contracted Calls; and
(c) Wilson missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Wilson, from October 2007 to September 2008, engaged in conduct in trade or commerce that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of section 52(1) of the Act by: 
(a) issuing monthly invoices (Invoices) to Customers:
 
(i) on the dates listed in column I of the Schedule;
 
(ii) for the amounts calculated by reference to the number of Contracted Calls; and
 
(b) representing to each of the Customers that Wilson had made the Contracted Calls to that Customer's premises in a particular month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls; and
(c) refraining from: 
 
(i) informing any of the Customers that it missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them; and
 
(ii) reducing the amount charged in the invoices or providing Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to the missed calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls;
 when in fact, during the relevant month:
(d) Wilson missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; and
 
(e) Wilson knew that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">BY CONSENT, THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 Injunctions 
 Wilson, whether by itself, its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever in connection with the supply or possible supply of Patrol Services in trade or commerce in Western Australia, be restrained for a period of three years from the date of the Court's order from issuing invoices to any customer of its Patrol Services for an amount calculated by reference to a number of Calls that it had contracted to make, or had represented that it would make to the customers' premises, unless, during the period covered by the invoice: 
(a) Wilson has made the agreed or represented number of Calls; 
 
(b) Wilson has charged only for the number of Calls actually made, on a "fee per call" basis; or
 
(c) if Wilson has missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson within 30 days after the date of the invoice:
 
(i) discloses that fact, and the total number of missed Calls or the number of missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, to that customer; and
 
(ii) pays to, or allows a credit or rebate to, that customer for each such missed Call pro rata to the monthly fee payable for the Calls that it had agreed to make, or had represented that it would make to the customer's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Other orders 
 Wilson, at its own expense and within 14 days of the date of this order, cause a letter to be sent to the Customers, in the terms and form as set out in Annexure A, advising of the Court's judgment, including its findings and the remedy granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Wilson, within 42 days of the date of this order, establish a compliance policy and associated complaints handling system, training and review system for its security business (including its Patrol Services business) in Western Australia in accordance with the program set out in Annexure B (Compliance Program).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Wilson maintain and operate the Compliance Program for a period of three years from the date of this order.</sentence>

<sentence id="s10">The Court also declared that Wilson breached section 52 of the Act, in that, during the period October 2007 to September 2008, Wilson, in the provision of mobile security patrol services, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by issuing monthly invoices to some customers for Contracted Calls without:
 
 
&#8226; informing those customers that Wilson had missed some Contracted Calls; and

<sentence id="s46">What follows are the reasons for the making of those consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">AGREED FACTS 
 The parties together submit that the Court should make the orders sought as set out in a minute of proposed consent orders, having regard to the conduct of the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In that regard, the parties through their solicitors signed a statement of agreed facts dated 4 December 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Court received this statement of agreed facts at the hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">As explained further below it appears to the Court that it is appropriate to regard the statement of agreed facts in determining whether or not to make orders in the proceeding by consent of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The statement of agreed facts provides as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The applicant is, and was at all material times, a body corporate established by s 6A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The respondent, Wilson Parking Australia 1992 Pty Ltd (Wilson), is, and was at all material times: a company duly incorporated and carrying on business in Australia; and a corporation within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Wilson is in the business of, among other things, providing mobile security patrol services (Patrol Services) to Customers in Western Australia through its security business division in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Wilson performs Patrol Services by causing its patrol officers to conduct security inspections of Customers' premises (Calls).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Typically, a patrol officer will be assigned a schedule (known as a "run") of premises to attend and inspect during a shift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">That schedule typically includes premises owned by more than one Customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Because Patrol Services are generally performed: 
(a) at times outside normal business hours; 
 
(b) without necessarily leaving any independent record of performance; and
 
(c) in the physical absence of the Customers and their employees;
 
it may be difficult for Customers to determine whether or not patrol officers have performed any particular number of Calls during a period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">On various dates, Wilson entered into Contracts (Contracts) for the supply of Patrol Services with each of the entities listed (Customers) in column A of the Schedule attached to the accompanying Minute of Consent Orders (Schedule).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">But not reproduced in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It was a term of each Contract that: 
(a) in supplying the Patrol Services, Wilson would make a stated number of Calls at the Customer's premises in a specified service period (Contracted Calls); and
 
(b) Wilson would use its best endeavours to provide the Contracted Calls, however interruptions or delays (or both) caused by break ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities may prevent all of the Contracted Calls being carried out during each service period (Permitted Missed Calls).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">This clause of each Contract was referred to by Wilson and is generally known in the security patrol industry as a "shared services clause" (Shared Services Clause).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The purpose of a Shared Services Clause is to provide for the possibility that a patrol officer may be delayed or prevented from making a call to one Customer's premises during a run because the patrol officer needed to respond to a break-in or other emergency at another Customer's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">During the period October 2007 to June 2008 (Relevant Period), Wilson had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make all of the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">During the Relevant Period, for each month specified in each row of column D of the Schedule: 
(a) Wilson made the number of Calls specified in the corresponding row of column F of the Schedule (Actual Calls) to the premises of the Customers specified in the corresponding row of column B of the Schedule; 
 
(b) the Actual Calls fell short of the Contracted Calls by the number specified in the corresponding row of column G of the Schedule (Missed Calls); 
 
(c) Wilson Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; and
 
(d) Wilson issued monthly Invoices (Invoices) to the Customers on the dates listed in column I of the Schedule for the amount due to be paid by the relevant Customer for the Contracted Calls for the relevant month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The amount of each invoice corresponded with the amount chargeable for the Contracted Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">By issuing each of the Invoices, Wilson represented to each Customer that it had made the Contracted Calls in the preceding month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls (Call Representations).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Call Representations were false because: 
(a) the Actual Calls for each Customer fell short of the Contracted Calls by the specified number of Missed Calls in column G of the Schedule; and
 
(b) Wilson Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">From October 2007 to June 2008, Wilson knew: 
(a) that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to perform the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers; and
 
(b) the matters set out in [15] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">From October 2007 to September 2008, Wilson refrained from: 
(a) informing any of the Customers of the number of Missed Calls;
 
(b) informing any of the Customers that it Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; 
 
(c) reducing the amount charged in the Invoices to less than the amount chargeable for the Contracted Calls; and
 
(d) providing the Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to any Missed Calls; 
 
when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In October 2007, Wilson operational management in Western Australia identified to Wilson senior management in Victoria that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to perform the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In early November 2007, Wilson senior management authorised and directed operational management to raise and pay credits to Customers for Missed Calls which were not Permitted Missed Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Due to a failure at an operational management level in Western Australia, credits, while provisioned in November, were not actually paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">From July 2008, Wilson was made aware of the ACCC's investigation of the conduct that is the subject of these proceedings, including the failure to pay credits or inform Customers about any failure to perform the Contracted Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Credits were then raised and paid by Wilson to Customers, backdated to and including October 2007 for Missed Calls, which were not Permitted Missed Calls, between October 2007 and June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Wilson has raised and paid credits for all Missed Calls to Customers, whether or not they are Permitted Missed Calls, as follows: 
(a) in September 2008, Wilson processed $84,104 worth of credits for the period October 2007 --- January 2008;
 
(b) in September 2009, Wilson processed $146,214.89 worth of credits for the period February 2008 --- July 2008;
 
(c) from August 2008, Wilson has issued a manual adjustment note after each monthly invoice, crediting Customers for any Missed Calls during the month covered by that invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">CONTRAVENING CONDUCT 
 In the light of the agreed facts, the parties accept that Wilson contravened the Act in the manner alleged by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The ACCC alleges that by making the Call Representations and refraining from informing its Customers of the true position, Wilson engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It is understood that the conduct will be misleading if it induces or is capable of inducing error: Parkdale Custom Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is not necessary to prove that anyone has in fact been misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The ACCC further alleges that by making the Call Representations Wilson falsely represented that services were of particular value in contravention of s 53(aa) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">A representation is false if it is contrary to fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">If the representation is not correct then it is false even if it is not false to the knowledge of the person making the representation: see Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 29 FLR 212 , per Franki J at 217; Darwin Bakery Pty Ltd v Sully [1981] FCA 115 ; (1981) 51 FLR 90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In this regard the ACCC point to the Invoices issued by Wilson at material times that represented to Customers that they had received the security services bargained for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Court accepts it is open to characterise the conduct of Wilson in the manner agreed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">ORDERS SOUGHT 
 Where a person has contravened s 52 and s 53(aa) of the Act, in a case such as the present, it is open to the Court on the application of a relevant party to grant relief of the following order: In this case, the parties agree that declarations, injunctions and non-punitive orders should be made under s 86.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The ACCC advised the Court that it does not seek refunds or compensation orders under s 87 because: The ACCC suggests the Court may not make an order under s 83 of the Act, because this matter is proceeding on the basis of admissions rather than a contested trial and refer in this regard to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 559 ; (2002) 190 ALR 169 at 183 -184, per Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Whether or not his Honour's observations referred are intended to stand for such a hard and fast rule does not need to be determined here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The ACCC's enforcement mode in this case need not be questioned on the facts agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Court also observes that the ACCC has not commenced proceedings under Pt VC of the Act and accordingly no pecuniary penalties may be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The parties agree that declarations should be made in terms of proposed orders 1 and 2 of the minute of proposed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Court has a wide discretion under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to make declarations of right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The declarations: The principles stated in Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 and applied by this Court in cases such as Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] support the making of the declarations in that: The proposed declarations are directed to the determination of a legal controversy not dealing with abstract or hypothetical questions, in that, 
 &#190; the ACCC has alleged and Wilson admits to engaging in conduct in contravention of the Act;
 
 &#190; the proposed declarations determine that the conduct alleged contravened the Act in the manner stated;
 
 &#190; the ACCC is responsible for enforcing the Act and therefore has a real interest in seeking the proposed declarations;
 
 &#190; the relief sought is not hypothetical and the making of the proposed declarations will result in real consequences including vindication of the ACCC's claim that Wilson contravened the Act; will assist the ACCC in performing its statutory duties in relation to consumer's of small business because it may alert, or may be used to alert, relevant individuals and market participants of the kind of conduct that may contravene the Act; Wilson is a proper contradictor because it is a party whose conduct is referred to in the proposed declarations and who has an interest in opposing them; and the making of the proposed declarations is in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">They will serve to mark the Court's disapproval of the particular conduct engaged in, in contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I am satisfied that the declarations should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">To the extent that it is suggested that the Court should not make declarations in such circumstances, where public rights are an issue, unless there is "evidence" before the Court, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought on the basis of the information currently before the Court, including the statement of agreed facts signed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">See generally my observations in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 at [49] --- [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">So far as the injunctions are concerned, the Court has the power under s 80 of the Act to make them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In the nature of public interest injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Consequently the injunctions are statutory in nature and not granted pursuant to the Court's equitable jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As s 80(4) and s 80(5) of the Act suggest, the Court has a wider jurisdiction to grant the injunction under s 80 than at general law, although traditional equity principles are not irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">See ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Injunctions can be made under s 80 if it is in the public interest to do so: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 200 ALR 491 at [212] and [216].</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The public interest may warrant the making of an injunction notwithstanding the contravener is not likely to repeat that conduct: see Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 300, per Toohey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41 --- 811 at [32].</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In this case an injunction is sought in the public interest to reduce the risk that Wilson will engage in similar conduct in the future that contravenes Pt V of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I accept that the admitted facts disclose a sufficient nexus between the conduct alleged and the orders sought: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1987) 148 ALR 339.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I also accept that the proposed injunction is sufficiently clearly and precisely stated to be capable of being complied with and would not require Court supervision: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [26] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The particular injunction sought to some extent requires Wilson to comply with the law, however it also has regard to the actual practices of the respondent and the circumstances in which it deals with Missed Calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It provides for refunds to Customers in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It is apparent therefore that the injunction if granted does more than admonish the respondent to comply with the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In the circumstances I consider the injunction to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The parties also request the Court to make orders pursuant to s 86C that would cause Wilson to send a letter to Customers advising them of the Court's judgment, findings and the remedies granted and also requiring Wilson to establish and maintain a compliance policy for three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The letter to Customers will achieve the result of advising them of the nature and extent of Wilson's conduct in contravention of the Act and the outcome of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It will protect consumers by alerting them to the fact that the conduct occurred, increase their awareness of the type of conduct that may breach the Act and encourage Customers to ensure that they receive the services to which they have contracted, and it is appropriate for such orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The compliance policy is intended to prevent further incidence of the conduct in future by ensuring that Wilson has procedures in place to educate its employees about the type of conduct that may breach the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">These compliance orders are consistent with the purpose of s 86C which is raising awareness of the type of conduct that may contravene the Act and as to the outcome of particular litigation: as to which see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41 --- 517.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">CONCLUSION AND ORDERS 
 For these reasons I am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in the minute of proposed consent orders should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Barker.</sentence>
