<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Mr Cumins, the respondent in the bankruptcy petition brought by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, seeks discovery of documents by motion dated 21 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">BACKGROUND 
 
2 The respondent, Mr Cumins, invested in excess of $5 million in what he described as "Infomercial Schemes" between 1996 and 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">An "Infomercial", according to the respondent, is an advertising film which is generally shown on television and promotes a product in an informative and objective style.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 On 23 October 2000, the applicant issued Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows:
 Year Ended Amount 
 1996 $ 3,344,884.24
 1997 $ 2,836,956.98
 1998 $12,954,263.05
 TOTAL $19,136,104.27
 
4 Those assessments were related to tax deductions claimed by the respondent in connection with his investments in the Infomercial Schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Those tax deductions were disallowed by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">5 On 23 November 2000 the applicant issued further Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows: 
 Year Amount 
 1995 $ 243,360.31
 1996 $ 123,141.55
 1998 $2,619,580.49
 
 TOTAL $2,986,082.35
 
6 In February 2001 the applicant filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to recover from the respondent the amounts of both the October and November 2000 assessments as well as interest and other charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">7 On 3 August 2001 the respondent commenced review proceedings in the AAT in respect of each of the applicant's decisions to disallow the respondent's objections to the assessments issued on 23 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In February 2005 the respondent withdrew the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The respondent says that he did so because he did not have the assistance of the promoters of the Infomercial Schemes including Mr Peter Leslie Ambrosy and that without his assistance it was not possible for him to present his case in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Pursuant to s 42(A)1B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , the affect of the withdrawal was that the AAT proceedings were considered to have been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">8 In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Infomercial Management Group Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 262 at [58] the Supreme Court of Victoria held that certain Infomercial schemes were a fraud on the investors, if not on the Australian Taxation Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These schemes, so claims the respondent, were the ones in which he had invested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">9 Importantly, other than in relation to a very small sum comprised in the 1998 assessment, none of the November 2000 assessments concerned the respondent's investments in the Infomercial Schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The assessment for 1998 for $2,619580.49 was subject to objections by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">These objections failed as did a subsequent review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In February 2005 an appeal to this Court from the decision of the AAT was dismissed by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The November 2000 assessments for 1995 and 1996 have never been the subject of an application for review or legal challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 On 15 June 2005 a summary judgment was entered in the Supreme Court proceedings against the respondent for the sum of $38,084,522.24 including interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The respondent did not consent to the judgment but did not oppose it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The amount of the judgment attributable to the assessments made on 23 November 2000 was $4,778,969.82 including interest charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The amount of $243,360.31 contained in the amended assessment issued on 23 November 2000 in respect of the 1995 financial year was not included in the judgment sum because it had by then been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However interest on this sum was claimed in the writ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">11 On 17 March 2006 the Deputy Commissioner issued a bankruptcy notice which was duly served on the respondent requiring payment, within 21 days after service, in the amount of $38,051,066.24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The amount demanded comprised the sum of the judgment less an amount of $33,456 described in the bankruptcy notice as "payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">12 On 23 August 2006 the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal in the Supreme Court (CACV 107 of 2006) out of time, to set aside the summary judgment on the basis that he was defrauded by the promoters of a tax avoidance scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In February 2007 a single judge dismissed the respondent's application for an extension of time to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In February 2007 the respondent filed an application for review by the Court of Appeal, which was ultimately dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">13 The respondent also failed in proceedings in this Court by which he had sought to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">This culminated in his appeal to the Full Court (WAD 361 of 2006) being dismissed on 24 December 2007: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">14 In November 2007 the respondent applied to the AAT to reinstate the proceedings which had been dismissed in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">15 On 29 January 2008 the District Registrar made orders that the respondent be permitted to use all documents filed in the AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Orders were also made that the applicant give discovery of any document recording or relating to any record of any kind dealing with any Running Balance Account as defined by s 8AAZA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) established by the applicant in relation to the respondent since 1 July 2000 as well as any record of any kind dealing with the receipt and application of payments made on behalf of the respondent to the applicant since 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Discovery in accordance with those orders was given by a list of documents filed on 6 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It comprised 19 volumes of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">THE DOCUMENTS 
 
16 It is only the balance of the documents set out in the motion which are now sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">These are contained in paras 1(a) and 1(b) as follows: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That the Applicant give discovery of any document in its possession, custody or control (including any communication, note or memorandum of a conversation, note or memorandum of a meeting, memorandum, note, report, working paper, or any draft thereof) recording or relating to: 
 
 (a) the Respondent since 1995;
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Applicant's investigations into the Infomercial Projects between 1995 and 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 
 
 
 
 

17 It is said that the documents are required in order to prepare the respondent for addressing this Court on the merit of the underlying debt in accordance with Wren v Mahony [1972] HCA 5 ; (1972) 126 CLR 212 at 224.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In other words the respondent seeks to go behind the Supreme Court summary judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">18 The respondent filed an affidavit sworn on 15 March 2007 in support of his opposition to the petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">He has filed further affidavits sworn by him on 6 December 2007, 21 January 2008 and 13 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">19 The applicant submits that it would be oppressive to be required to discover these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Ms Yen-Lin Chong, a litigator employed in the Legal Services Branch of the Australian Taxation Office deposes as follows: 
 
 
 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Some of the documents in the applicant's possession, custody or control pertaining to the respondent since 1995 and the applicant's investigations into the Infomercial Project between 1995 and 2003 are contained in two six-foot high double-doored cabinets and approximately fifty lever arch files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 
 
 
 
 64.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The volume of documents which fall into the categories identified by the respondent are so voluminous that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 64.1. the time required to locate, identify and inspect the documents would take weeks, if not months, as would the process of preparing a list of discovered documents; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 64.2. the process of discovery would be a very costly and time consuming exercise to the extent of being oppressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I verily believe that the time and cost of discovery in the terms sought by the respondent would grossly outweigh the benefit, if any, obtained and would only serve to further delay the determination of the applicant's petition for bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 
 

20 The respondent submits that the list of documents filed in these proceedings on 6 February 2008 has created areas of interest which should be the subject of further discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In particular he submits that:
 
 
 (a) the Applicant appears to have kept running balance accounts in relation to him, this being in issue in the Full Federal Court Appeal (WAD 361 of 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the garnishee payment for June 2005 seems to have been paid to the Applicant but not credited in Applicant's account history for him in accordance with the method employed in relation to the other garnishee payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) there should be a record of when the Applicant became aware of PAYG withholding payments which are absent from the running balance accounts furnished to him to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

21 Orders were made by Registrar Jan on 29 January 2008 in terms of paragraph 1(c) of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This responds to the respondent's submissions set out at para 20(a) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The matter of garnishee payments had been the subject of a prior affidavit of Nola Kathleen Rice, an officer employed within the Australian Taxation Office, sworn 28 August 2006 in response to an application by the respondent to set aside the bankruptcy notice in which at [19] she sets out the garnishee payments on behalf of the respondent received by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In his affidavit sworn 5 September 2006 in that same action the respondent [3] responds by annexing the notices of assessment but otherwise taking no issue with Ms Rice's summary of payments, including in particular that any payments made by the respondent have been omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The garnishee payments are further explained in the affidavit of Yen-Lin Faith Chong sworn 19 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The matter raised in written submissions set out at para 20(c) above was not explained and it is difficult to discern its relevance to any matter at issue in the Bankruptcy proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">22 No submissions were made as to why all of the applicant's documents in respect to its investigations into the Infomercial Schemes between 1995 and 2003 should be discovered other than to the effect that they must be relevant to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I do not regard that as satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">No attempt was made by counsel for the respondent to articulate an issue, or answer, or a possible answer to the Bankruptcy petition to which any of these documents would be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I do not regard what the respondent deposed to at paras [29]-[30] in his affidavit of 23 August 2006, in relation to his Notice of Appeal in the Supreme Court, as support for the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">These statements of the respondent's belief are conjectural and argumentative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">They were not the subject of specific submissions by counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">23 Likewise, no attempt was made to justify the need for discovery of all documents in the applicant's possession, custody or control relating to the respondent since 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">24 At a further hearing on 10 March 2008, it was submitted by the respondent that the summary judgment figure had been overstated by $243,360.31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">This is the Amended Tax Assessment figure issued on 23 November 2000 for the year ended 30 June 1995 and set out at para [17.1] of Ms Chong's affidavit sworn 29 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">25 It is common ground that this amount has already been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">26 The evidence of Ms Chong in her affidavit of 29 January 2008 which was before the Court at the first hearing is to the effect that the amount of $243,360.31 was not included in the summary judgment amount: [68].</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">That figure is not amongst those which comprise the debt of $38,032,100.01 claimed in the creditor's petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">27 The document which the respondent relies upon in his attempt to controvert this fact is the Notice of Amended Assessment for the year ended 30 June 2005 which is at p 82 of the affidavit of Ms Chong of 29 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It contains the figure of $243,360.31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It was however paid after the Assessment was issued and before Summary Judgment was entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">I do not accept that there was any such overstatement in the Summary Judgment amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">28 On 21 February 2008 the respondent's solicitors wrote to the applicant's solicitor enclosing a copy of a letter sent by the ATO to the respondent dated 15 November 2000 together with a number of attached schedules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">29 The respondent submits that Ms Chong's statement in her supplementary affidavit [3] that she had not previously seen the letter from the ATO to the respondent dated 15 November 2000 together with enclosed schedules justified the respondent's concerns about the adequacy of the applicant's discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">30 The letter concerned set out how income tax returns for the respondent and the Cumins Family Trust for the financial years 1995 and 1998 would be amended in accordance with the position papers previously sent and the attached schedules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">One of the attached schedules, which was for the year ended 30 June 1998, disclosed an adjustment figure of $9,375 for "Interest re monies borrowed re: Infomercials".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">31 It was not said why the fact that Ms Chong had not seen the letter and its attachments before gave cause for concern as the adequacy of the applicant's discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In the circumstances, it does not provide any cogent reason for ordering the further discovery sought by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">32 I am not persuaded that it is necessary to discover these documents: Federal Court Rules O 15 r 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Further it would, in my opinion, be oppressive in the circumstances identified in the affidavit of Ms Chong sworn on 29 January 2008 to order discovery as sought in paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">33 The motion will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
