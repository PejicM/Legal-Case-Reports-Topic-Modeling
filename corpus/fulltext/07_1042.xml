 BUCHANAN J: 
 
1 This judgment deals only with a question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 15 June 2007 I ordered that Mr Walsh's statement of claim and application be, respectively, struck out and dismissed ( Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 880).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Costs were reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Written submissions have now been made about that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The respondent seeks its costs in relation to both the notice of motion dealt with in the earlier judgment and of the proceedings as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It submits, in relation to each, that costs should follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 Although the respondent's submissions made a formal distinction between the costs of the notice of motion and the costs of the proceedings as a whole in my view it is not necessary to give them separate consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Consideration of the notice of motion disposed of the proceedings in their entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">There are no features of the proceedings, or the notice of motion, which require that individual attention be given to each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 In the ordinary course the respondent is entitled to its costs unless there was some particular feature of the proceedings which suggests that the Court's discretion should be exercised in a different way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Walsh's written submissions do not really come to grips with the principles which govern the award of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He has not advanced any matter which would require or justify an exercise of discretion against the respondent, so far as costs are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 In the circumstances it is appropriate that costs follow the event and I will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Associate:
