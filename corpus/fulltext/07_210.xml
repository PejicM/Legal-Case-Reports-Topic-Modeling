<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of India who arrived in Australia on 17 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 2 February 2004 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa.</sentence>

<sentence id="s6">The appellant attended the hearing, was assisted by a Hindi interpreter and gave oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 13 July 2004 the Tribunal was reconstituted due to the retirement of the member who had conducted the original hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 On 31 August 2004 the appellant was sent a letter pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") informing him of the reconstitution of the Tribunal.</sentence>

 GROUNDS BEFORE THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 

5 By amended application filed in that Court on 19 May 2005 the appellant sought a review of the decision of the Tribunal on the ground that the Tribunal did not accord the appellant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He contended that the Tribunal had been reconstituted "against the system" and that the interpreter had failed to interpret his claims correctly and "suppressed" him from speaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant asserted that the invitation to provide further submissions without granting another hearing was "unusual".</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Further, the appellant claimed that the use of the same interpreter to assist him at the second hearing, after the appellant had complained about his earlier performance, amounted to procedural error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 

6 The Federal Magistrate found that the reconstitution of the Tribunal was undertaken consistently with s 422 of the Act and that it did not constitute a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 The learned Magistrate found no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal arising from the allegations of errors of translation, "suppression" and the use of the same interpreter at both hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The appellant had not provided any evidence of errant translation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His Honour noted that no complaint was directed to the translation provided at the second hearing and that, at that hearing, the appellant had had the opportunity of telling the Tribunal about any material errors which had occurred at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He had not done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 NOTICE OF APPEAL 

8 By notice of appeal to this Court filed on 14 November 2006, the appellant raises the following ground: 
 
 "That the Learned Federal Magistrate failed to appreciate the harm faced by the appellant as the appellant was persecuted by the Muslim Student Association League and the members of the Indian National Lok Dal .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The appellant's case requires the judicial notice by this Court as the appellant's case was twice heard by the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appellant objections were as to the translation by the interpreter during the course of the interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On the second occasion the member of the RRT retried, on the second occasion another member heard the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This has resulted in the legal and jurisdictional error by the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">"
