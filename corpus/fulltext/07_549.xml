<sentence id="s0">
 
1 At one point I was minded to require the administrator to pay all the plaintiff's costs on a solicitor and client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">See my reasons in Hem, in the matter of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Cant (Administrator of the Deed of Company Arrangement of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2007] FCA 81.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Having reflected on the matter further and having considered the submissions by the administrator's counsel I am satisfied that my original view was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 In order to deal with the costs the application should be divided into several parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">First, there is the plaintiff's application to extend the time within which to appeal the administrator's rejection of his proofs of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That application came about because the plaintiff failed to bring his appeals within time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There is no reason why the administrator should bear the costs associated with the application for the extension while the application was before the registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In fact it has been agreed that the plaintiff should pay the administrator's costs of the application to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 The second part is the review of the registrar's refusal to extend the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The plaintiff succeeded on the review and should have his costs of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Next there are the appeals proper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In fact there were two appeals, one in relation to each proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Following the extension of time for the appeals the administrator reassessed his rejection of the proof for the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In due course that proof was admitted in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In effect, then, the plaintiff was successful and should have his costs of that appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 In a winding up the usual order on a successful appeal against the rejection of a proof is that the costs of the application (but not of the proof) be taxed on a party and party basis and paid out of the company's assets: In re National Wholemeal Bread and Biscuit Company [1892] 2 Ch 457, 461.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This follows the practice in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I think the practice should also apply to administrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It follows that the plaintiff's costs of prosecuting the appeal against the rejection of the proof of debt for the loan should be paid as part of the costs of the administration of Coulco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 The other appeal was in relation to the proof for wrongful dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The plaintiff was successful on that appeal and is entitled to his costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The plaintiff seeks these costs on a solicitor and client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 Here it is necessary to consider what are the duties of an administrator on receipt of a proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In my view his duties are the same as the duties of a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The duties were described by Lord Denning MR in Austin Securities Ltd v Northgate &amp; English Stores Ltd [1969] 1 WLR 529, 532.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He said that the liquidator's duty was "to enquire into all claims, to see whether they are well-founded or not, to pay the good claims, to reject the bad, to settle the doubtful, or, if need be, to contest them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">" But, in my opinion, the right of an administrator to contest a doubtful claim in court is not unqualified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">This is a case where he should have done more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">8 On 27 September 2006, the plaintiff offered to compromise his wrongful dismissal claim on the basis that he would reduce his claim from $75,000 to $37,500 with costs of $3,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The offer was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In deciding to reject the offer the administrator did not seek directions from the court as regards the course he should take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This is what liquidators can do: In re The Fruit and Vegetable Company Ltd (1912) 12 SR (NSW) 52; In re The Pastoral Finance Association Ltd (1922) 23 SR (NSW) 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">And an administrator can do the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Having failed to seek directions to protect his position the administrator put himself at risk on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The risk was that if the plaintiff did better than his offer, he might have his costs taxed on a special basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 In my view the plaintiff is entitled to his costs up to 11 October 2006 taxed on a party and party basis and thereafter on a solicitor and client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The date I have chosen is fourteen days after the date of the offer and is a reasonable time for the administrator to consider the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The costs will not be ordered against the administrator personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">That should only occur in the case of misconduct or negligence and I do not think that the administrator is guilty of either.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">10 There was some discussion whether the plaintiff's costs should be reduced for him having lost certain points that he had put forward in support of his appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I think there is no warrant for such an approach, especially in a one day case where the overall costs were not increased, or substantially increased, by arguments that failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">11 Finally, I must deal with the costs of the hearing on 3 October 2006 which were occasioned by the plaintiff's application to reopen his case and tender additional evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In my earlier reasons I said those costs should be borne by Mr Hem on a solicitor and client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">There is nothing in the parties' submissions that dissuades me from that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">12 I will make orders in accordance with the foregoing discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
