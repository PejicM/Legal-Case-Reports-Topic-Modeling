1 When I published my reasons in Fadu Pty Ltd v ACN 008 112 196 Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1965 , I directed that the parties file and serve draft minutes of order to give effect to my findings and reasons and to make submissions on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The differences between them that were evidenced in the hearing subsist still.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 As to the orders to be made, I should indicate that I intend to dismiss the Amended Application (which sought relief in respect of restraints of trade at common law) for the reason that, by virtue of s 4M of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth), the law relating to restraint of trade at common law was, in the circumstances, not capable of operating concurrently with s 87(3) of the TP Act, which was invoked by the first, fourth, seventh and eighth respondents ("the respondents") in their cross-claim of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">My so doing does not imply that the applicants did not enjoy any measure of success in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">But for the provisions of s 4M which in turn attracted the remedial provisions of s 87(3), the applicants would have been entitled to the relief they sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It was only the respondents invocation of s 87(3) --- and the respondents in the circumstances had the incentive to do so --- that resulted in a lesser success for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Accordingly, I will order that:
 
(i) the application be dismissed; and 
 
 (ii) on the cross-claim, the terms of clause 2 of the Deed Poll dated 30 September 2005 be varied so as to read as follows: 
 
 
 "2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Restraint Givers jointly and severally covenant that they will not (and that they will procure that their related entities do not): 
 
 
 
 
 2.1 Conduct, or be involved, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of, a laundry hire business; 
 2.2 ... 
 
 
 
 
 in any part of the area within the boundary line marked out in Appendix 'B' in the reasons for judgment published in this proceedings on 11 December 2007 for a period of three years after the Completion Date (as that term is defined in the Heads of Agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">" 
 

4 On the issue of costs, the applicants seek that the respondents pay their costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondents in turn seek an order that the applicants pay 75% of their costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Both sides of this matter enjoyed a real measure of success but neither side was successful on its primary case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The reason for this is because I found, in the circumstances, that the restraints in question contravened s 45(2) of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Though the respondents alone sought an order under s 87(3) of the Act to have the restraints varied --- the applicants positively opposed such an order --- the effect of my so ordering resulted in a lesser measure of success than either side of the litigation sought to secure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 It is well accepted that the general discretion conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to award costs is absolute and unfettered but that it must be exercised judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is equally well accepted that in the exercise of that discretion:
 
 (i) ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order;
 (ii) where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed; and
 (iii) a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties' costs of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In this sense "issue" does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or law.</sentence>

 Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at [11] approving Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 69 ALR 660; ATPR 40-748 at 48,136.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">See generally Dal Pont, Laws of Costs , ch 8 (2003).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 The present matter is not one in which it is appropriate in my view to attempt an issue by issue dissection of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In the view I have taken of proceedings, it is best described as a composite one in which matters dealt with in the application infused the cross-claim and, importantly, the manner in which I considered the discretion under s 87(3) ought properly to be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As I noted above, each party secured a measure of success albeit not the particular measure for which they held their respective hopes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Rather than attempting to apportion the costs of the application and cross-claim respectively, the appropriate course to take is to deal with the matter as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">So viewed, I consider the proper approach to take is to order that the respondents pay 50 per cent of the applicants' costs in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">This, doubtless, reflects a rough evaluation of the balance of the successes and failures actually experienced by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">But it fully reflects my own appreciation of the significance of the respective successes of the parties in the matter and, I would emphasise, of the consequences of the various forensic choices they made that contrived both the course of, and the shape of the issues in, the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Accordingly, I will order that (iii) the first, fourth, seventh and eighth respondents pay 50 per cent of the applicants' costs of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">7 I have made no orders in respect of the restraints imposed in the Heads of Agreement dated 5 August 2005 notwithstanding that the respondents "draft orders" seeks that I do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The reason I take this course is that such relief was not sought either in the application or in the cross-claim and so was not a matter in issue before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">No amendment of the pleadings was sought by any of the parties even after I had adverted to this situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>
