<sentence id="s0">
 The applicants seek eight categories of documents by way of further discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Six of the categories are sought upon the basis that they are necessary for their expert witness, Professor Rubinfeld, to complete his report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The other two categories comprise documents which were filed or served in proceedings in the Victorian Registry of the Court, Cadbury Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd &amp; Ors (VID 1377 of 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The background to the claim for the first six categories is to be found in two judgments of Tamberlin J, Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2007] FCA 1559 ; Jarra Creek Central Packaging Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2009] FCA 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Tamberlin J was the docket judge for the matter before he reached the age of Constitutional retirement on 31 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Tamberlin J's second judgment was delivered on 6 February 2009 when his Honour made orders for further discovery sought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He did so upon the basis of evidence from Professor Rubinfeld and "the unsatisfactory nature of the discovery to date".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The essence of what was ordered by Tamberlin J was the discovery of sales/price, costs of production and production data for corrugated fibreboard packaging (CFP) and pulp paper products (PPP), which are physical inputs in the manufacture of CFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">His Honour's orders covered the period from 1 January 1998 to 1 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The reason why discovery was ordered was that those documents were considered to be necessary for the purpose of enabling Professor Rubinfeld to construct an economic model to arrive at an opinion as to what would have been the true price of CFP and PPP but for the existence of a cartel between the Amcor respondents and the Visy respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The cartel is said in the Statement of Claim to have been formed in early 2000 and continued until November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The existence of the cartel is said to have been publicly exposed when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued a press release on 21 December 2005, the same day on which it commenced proceedings against Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The purpose of discovery of documents covering the period before and after the existence of the cartel is to enable Professor Rubinfeld to have documents covering a "clean period" before and after the cartel so that economic evidence may be given as to the "but for" hypothesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The period for which documents were to be discovered was determined as long ago as Tamberlin J's first judgment on the question in October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">His Honour accepted the need for clean period documents before and after the cartel period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He said at [14] of that judgment that he was not satisfied "at this stage" that documents outside of the eight year period were "appropriate or necessary" for the purpose of ascertaining a benchmark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicants now rely on evidence of certain deficiencies in the material produced, and on further evidence from Professor Rubinfeld to support the widening of the period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The essence of Professor Rubinfeld's further evidence is that the material provided to date does not have sufficient coverage or detail to enable him to conduct a reliable analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">There was some criticism by counsel for the Amcor and Visy respondents of the nature of Professor Rubinfeld's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, I am satisfied that it does demonstrate that the discovery of data for a wider period than that ordered by Tamberlin J is "necessary in the interests of a fair trial": Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Limited (No 4) (1995) 58 FCR 426 at 436 per Lindgren J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The "clean period" data which is sought places some emphasis on the post-cartel period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This is because of the inadequacy of the pre-cartel data discovered to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Although Professor Rubinfeld accepts that it is preferable to analyse data for the period prior to the formation of the cartel, he says that in the absence of such data, post-cartel material takes on an even greater importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Although some post-cartel material, namely from November 2004 to May 2006 has already been produced, Professor Rubinfeld says that this is "highly unlikely" to be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I accept this evidence and the reasons given for it, including the difficulties associated with the lingering effects of cartel behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I reject the suggestion of the respondents as to the lack of utility of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Nor do I consider that in litigation of this magnitude, the costs associated with the exercise are so burdensome as to warrant denial of additional discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The only real question is, as Tamberlin J observed nearly two years ago, to determine the suitable period before and after the cartel behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In doing so, I take into account the apparent inadequacy of the material going back to 1998 and the need to set a period after the existence of the cartel was made public, to take into account the possible lingering effects on competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Court maintains control over its own interlocutory orders, particularly those made for the management of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I am satisfied that I ought to make orders for discovery of the documents covering categories 1 to 6 in the Amended Notice of Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I do not consider it is appropriate to limit the period to 30 June 2007 as was submitted on behalf of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">To do so would fail to take into account the date on which the existence of the cartel is said to have been exposed, the potential lingering effects of the cartel on the market, and the inadequacy of pre-cartel data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Categories 7 and 8 seek, as I said earlier, documents filed in the Cadbury proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">These documents are sought in relation to the issues of liability and damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As to liability, the Amcor and Visy respondents do not admit either the existence of the cartel or that it was put into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Nevertheless, I do not consider that the documents identified in categories 7 and 8 are "necessary" within the terms of O 15 r 15 or Practice Note 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Nor are they "directly relevant" to the proceeding: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 366 at [21] --- [23] per Lindgren J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The issues in this proceeding are different from those in the Cadbury proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Such overlap as does exist is not sufficient to warrant the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">To the extent that the documents are sought on the issue of damages, I do not consider they are relevant or necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As was submitted by the respondents, any relevant documents are already covered by existing orders so that what is really sought is nothing more than the right to "fish" for further material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">One further order was sought on the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It was for leave to amend the existing Further Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The only contest between the parties was as to the proposed [89C].</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In my view, that paragraph pleads the allegations at such a level of generality that the respondents ought not to have to plead to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The deficiency could be cured by particulars but the applicants should be in a position to do so either now, or following the further discovery I will order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I therefore propose to refuse leave in respect of [89C].</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I direct the parties to bring in short minutes to reflect my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
