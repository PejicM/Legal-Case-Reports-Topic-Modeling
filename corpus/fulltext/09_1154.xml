<sentence id="s0">
 On 14 August 2009, I gave judgment in default in favour of the Australian Communication and Media Authority (the Authority) against, materially, the Fourth Respondent, Mr Simon Anthony Owen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 18 September 2009, I made orders in relation to, again materially, Mr Owen, which provided for a form of substituted service as well as for the provision of material directed to the subject of a hearing in respect of penalty to occur in the Court on 23 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Application has been made this afternoon ex parte for an order in the nature of a Mareva order in respect of Mr Owen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">That order is sought so as to prevent the frustration of a costs order which I made on the 14 August 2009 in favour of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr Owen is jointly and severally liable, along with other respondents against whom default judgment was entered that day, for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The amount of the Authority's costs has yet to be quantified, either by taxation or agreement with, materially, Mr Owen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I have evidence before me, from an experienced legal practitioner within the Australian Government Solicitor's office, the solicitor for the Authority, which satisfies me that, even allowing for whatever inefficiencies may attend the charging as between solicitor and client of costs calculated by reference to time costing, there is a likelihood that the taxed costs, as between party and party, of the Authority pursuant to the order which I made on 14 August 2009, will be at least $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In making that observation I am not to be taken, in any way, to be binding the Court's taxing officer to tax a bill at, at least, that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Rather, it is merely an observation, prima facie, on the material to hand, of a likelihood of a bill being taxed at, at least, that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That the Federal Court has power to grant an order in the nature of a Mareva order is established by cases such as Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Court being one established by the Parliament pursuant to the Constitution and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1982 (Cth) (Federal Court of Australia Act), the source of power is to be found in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It may be described aptly as part of the Court's incidental jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In this instance, the application is one in respect of a costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I am satisfied that the effect of the order as to costs, which I made on 14 August 2009, is indeed one which subjects Mr Owen to a joint and several liability: see in that regard Thiess Watkins White Construction Limited (in liquidation) v Witan Nominees (1985) Pty Limited (1992) 2 QR 452 , and Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Limited No 3 (1979) 42 FLR 213 at 223 and 224.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">An order in the nature of a Mareva injunction in support of a costs order, and even a costs order prior to taxation of costs, is not unprecedented: see Commissioner of State Taxation West Australia v Nechold Pty Limited (1995) 30 ATR 69 at 72(a); see also Jetwest Limited v Haddican (1992) 2 All ER 545 at 548(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The evidence read establishes, prima facie, a reasonable basis to suppose that, after 14 August 2009, and at a time when the order made that day had been drawn to his attention, if only at the behest of process servers engaged by the Australian Government Solicitor, Mr Owen has embarked upon a process of liquidating assets and so doing with a view to departing the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Of particular note, in that regard, again prima facie, is the offering for sale of a BMW motor vehicle, registration number "TXT", at what, it seems, is a considerable discount from what one might regard as the usual sale price for a vehicle of that make, age and kilometrage ($157,000 compared with an offering for sale of $129,000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Other items of personal furniture also seem to be being offered for sale via the internet by Mr Owen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The amount which is sought by way of freezing of assets is up to $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The time for return of an order is given the ex parte nature of the application made today, necessarily short.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It will be 1 October 2009 at 9.30am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As befits any applicant for ex parte relief, and especially an authority of the Commonwealth, there has been, commendably, full disclosure, both of matters going to jurisdiction, as well as discretion for and against, in the submissions made this afternoon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It seems to me that it is appropriate, against the background I have described, to make an order in terms of the draft presented to me, and altered slightly in the course of submissions, so as to protect the processes of the Federal Court from abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">For these reasons I make an order in terms of the draft which I have amended, signed and placed with the court papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I note that the Authority has given the undertakings in Schedule A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I grant leave, insofar as the same is necessary, for the applicant Authority to have that order passed and entered forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I reserve, as provided for in the draft, the costs of today's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
