 1 This proceeding was commenced by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") by originating process filed on 17 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The proceeding seeks relief in respect of an unregistered managed investment scheme known as "FullTank" ("the Scheme").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The Scheme was conducted by the second defendant, BTS Management Pty Ltd ("BTS"), under and by reference to the business name "Chargeitcards".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first defendant ("McDougall") is the sole director of BTS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The business name registration records that both BTS and McDougall carry on business under the name Chargeitcards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The evidence establishes that there are no registered managed investment schemes conducted under the names "BTS Management", "Chargeitcards" or "FullTank".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Further, neither BTS nor McDougall holds an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of financial services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Merkel J granted interim and interlocutory relief on 18 October and 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The orders made by Merkel J on 25 October 2005 included:
 
 (a) injunctive orders pursuant to ss 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") restraining the defendants from operating or promoting the Scheme; 
 (b) orders pursuant to s 1101B(4)(b)(i) of the Act suspending all internet websites within the power or control of the defendants promoting, advertising or offering the Scheme; and
 (c) orders pursuant to ss 601EE and 1323 of the Act appointing receivers of all the property of BTS and directing the receivers to investigate and report on the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">

The receivers subsequently filed a report with the Court on 22 November 2005 detailing the results of their investigation of the Scheme.</sentence>

 " THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 
 On the basis of the evidence contained in the affidavits and their respective exhibits filed by the Plaintiff: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">From September 2005 until October 2005 the Defendants contravened section 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 by operating an unregistered managed investment scheme defined in the Schedule to the Order ('the Scheme') which required registration as a managed investment scheme but was not so registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">From September 2005 until October 2005 the Defendants contravened section 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 by carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, by offering interests in the Scheme, without holding an Australian financial services licence.</sentence>

The defendants, BTS and McDougall consent to the orders in paragraphs 3 to 14 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">They do not oppose the making of the declarations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">OUTLINE OF THE FULLTANK SCHEME 
 
6 The Scheme was marketed by the defendants as a fuel club which allowed members to purchase fuel at a substantial discount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">This was to be achieved by issuing a debit card to each member investing in the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The debit card could be used to purchase fuel and other goods at fuel retailers through the EFTPOS system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The defendants promised a substantial discount on the cost of fuel, which varied from 80 per cent in September 2005 down to 50 per cent in October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">7 The defendants launched the Scheme and began accepting membership applications on 12 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Scheme became operational on 10 October 2005 when the first amounts were uploaded to debit cards issued to the investing members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The debit cards in question were stored value debit cards issued by EMerchants Holdings Pty Ltd.
 
8 As at 25 October 2005, the Scheme had 134 investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Of those investors, approximately 107 had paid their full subscription.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">By 25 October 2005, total funds invested in the Scheme amounted to $93,193.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The remaining cash balance of the Scheme as at 25 October 2005 was $33,150.22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">THE FULLTANK WEBSITE 
 
9 The Scheme was marketed by means of a website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The address of the website was http://chargeitcards.com/fulltank .</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The website represented to the general public that FullTank members could make very substantial savings on their fuel bill over a 20 week period by subscribing to one of FullTank's fuel plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">For a short time, the Scheme offered benefits over a 52 week period, but this was soon shortened to 20 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The available fuel plans were:

Potential investors could select a fuel plan from these options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">As the table makes clear, the numeric component of the fuel plan description refers to the dollar amount which would be credited to an investor's debit card each week for the period of the plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">10 As it stood on 12 October 2005, the FullTank website made the following representations:
 
 "Never pay full price for fuel again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">FullTank offers the worlds first and only fuel club that allows members to save 50% on all their fuel costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Members are supplied with an easy to use FullTank Debit Card that is loaded each week with their nominated weekly fuel requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">FullTank Cards can be used at all correctly coded (EFTPOS) fuel outlets across Australia, even if they have never heard of FullTank !</sentence>

 FAQs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Please read the follow information carefully as your questions and concerns should be covered here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 ... 
 
 Q8: How can FullTank pay for so much of my fuel ?</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 FullTank cannot disclose this information as doing so would forfeit it's intellectual property and therefore limit our ability to pass savings onto members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 
 Q9: What guarantees are there that your program is going to last the full 12 months or beyond?</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is a possible scenario that you may take everybody's money upfront, last say 2-3 months and then disappear with everyone's fees and not deliver on the fuel.</sentence>

<sentence id="s80">
 The price of fuel has no affect on FullTank except to say that you will get less fuel for your money when you fill up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" 
 

Similar claims were made on the website at other times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">As at 20 September 2005, the website claimed that members would save up to 80 per cent on all their fuel costs by subscribing to FullTank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">11 The website explicitly withholds any information about how members' funds would be invested and how the fuel savings would be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">THE USE OF SUBSCRIPTION MONIES 
 
12 McDougall was examined by ASIC on 11 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In the course of his examination, he said that the defendants intended to invest money provided by subscribers to the Scheme in various high yield investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In fact, the only investment made by the defendants was an investment in a foreign exchange trading account with Forex Capital Markets LLC ("Forex").</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Forex is based in New York, USA, and provides an online internet currency trading facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">13 McDougall apparently believed that he could make sufficient profits from online foreign exchange trading to fund the Scheme's obligations to its investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In the course of his examination, he said he expected returns of approximately 30 per cent per month with minimal risk of loss as a result of foreign exchange trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">This implies a return of 360 per cent per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In fact, the evidence is that in the first two weeks of online currency trading, the defendants incurred a loss of $2649.87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">14 Foreign exchange trading involves a high level of risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Some of these risks are referred to on the website maintained by Forex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">During the course of his examination by ASIC, McDougall said that he did not have any experience in the foreign currency market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He also conceded that investors in the Scheme were totally unaware that their funds were being used to invest in foreign exchange trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">15 It is clear that, unless McDougall and BTS made extraordinary profits from currency trading, the only way that the Scheme's obligations to its investors could be met would be through the use of membership fees paid by new investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">A Scheme which operates in this manner is commonly described as a "Ponzi" scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">ASIC's consumer protection website has described a Ponzi scheme in the following terms:
 
 "In these schemes the promoter promises investors a very high return on their investment and says it is secure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Part of the money deposited by early investors is then used to pay their first dividend cheques or interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">So long as the money keeps flowing into the scheme, payments can still come out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">However, the burden of future payments also keeps growing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The scheme inevitably collapses once people stop joining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">" 
 

16 BTS did not maintain accurate books and records of the transactions conducted under the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In their report to the Court, the receivers constructed a summary of cash receipts and payments into and out of the Scheme for the period from 12 September 2005 to 25 October 2005, and a table of the Scheme's available assets as at 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Of the $93,193 invested in the Scheme by investors, $30,000 was paid into a foreign currency trading account with Forex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">After accumulated trading losses of $2649 and certain fees charged by Forex, the available balance of $27,303 was recovered from Forex by the receivers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The invested funds were also used to make various private payments on behalf of McDougall and BTS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">For instance, McDougall caused $5044 to be paid to a company which provides horse racing software; a laptop computer was purchased for the private use of McDougall's sister at a cost of $1297; motor vehicle expenses of $2000 were paid in respect of McDougall's personal motor vehicles; school fees of $1000 were paid to the school attended by McDougall's children; and $4000 was paid into McDougall's personal Totaliser Agency Board account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">BTS also issued five fuel cards to members of McDougall's family despite the fact that they had not paid any membership fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Using the funds invested in the Scheme by other members, each of these cards was subsequently credited with $1000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE SCHEME 
 
17 After investigating the financial position of the Scheme, the receivers reported to the Court that the Scheme had an estimated deficiency before receivers' costs of $41,162.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Receivers' costs payable out of the assets under receivership are in the order of $40,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In large measure, the deficiency in the Scheme is attributable to the fact that total liabilities outstanding to members are $83,370, whereas the total assets available to the Scheme are only $49,423.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">18 The receivers concluded that if the Scheme were allowed to continue operating with the limited cash assets available to it, those assets would be dissipated in approximately 5 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In their opinion, the Scheme was fundamentally flawed, particularly given that the implicit rate of return required to refund the outstanding payments to investors was completely unachievable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">They recommended that the Scheme not be allowed to continue to operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF BTS 
 
19 The receivers also investigated the financial position of BTS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Their evidence was that BTS had an estimated deficiency of liabilities over assets of $118,561.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">CONDUCT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS 
 
20 After the Court made interlocutory orders on 25 October 2005, investors in the Scheme received an email from Mr Rob McMillan ("McMillan") on the subject of "FullTank Resolution Options".</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">McMillan is a member of the Scheme and an associate of McDougall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">21 The email to FullTank investors stated, inter alia :
 
 "By now you will have received a letter from Ferrier Hodgson (appointed receivers by ASIC) outlining ASIC's determination to close down Chargeitcards' FullTank program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Having read previous emails and perhaps speaking with you over the phone this may come as no surprise to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 As a result a new structure has formed an alliance with a large membership organisation that plans to take the new program both nationally &amp; internationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">But before this can happen, FullTank is required by ASIC to fully dissolve the original membership, resulting in the closure of the original program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 
 Most of you have indicated your willingness to continue your involvement in a fuel program &amp; it is FullTank's intention to honour their obligations however one of two things must happen before they can proceed with the new fuel program:..." 
 

The email went on to state that two options were available to investors: either they could elect to receive a reimbursement from the receivers, or they could elect to cease involvement in the original Scheme and to continue membership under a new structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The second option required investors to return a letter to BTS which stated that the investor wished to forgive BTS of any debt owed to the investor concerning the FullTank program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">22 McDougall told the receivers that he had caused the email to be sent out because he did not want any of the investors in the FullTank Scheme to lose money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">McDougall also said that he realised that the email may be a breach of the Court's interlocutory orders of 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">23 There is also evidence before me, which I accept, that members of the Scheme received telephone calls from an unknown person who said he was a fellow member who was making the call on behalf of McDougall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The caller told members that there would be new cards issued and not to be discouraged as the Scheme would reopen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">24 McDougall received a large number of letters from investors in the Scheme in response to the email by which those investors agreed to forgive any debts owed to them by BTS in relation to the FullTank program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">25 The evidence also shows that on 17 October 2005 BTS purported to assign the business name "Chargeitcards", the domain name www.chargeitcards.com , and the product name "FullTank" to Mr Timothy McDougall, who is McDougall's son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">26 Understandably, ASIC pointed to this material as indicating that there was a substantial risk that the defendants would repeat their contraventions of the Act , unless they were restrained from engaging in similar conduct in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">FULLTANK WAS AN UNREGISTERED MANAGED INVESTMENT SCHEME 
 
27 Relevantly, s 9 of the Act defines a managed investment scheme as a scheme that has the following features:
 
 "(i) people contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not); 
 (ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders); 
 (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 
 

 Section 9 excludes various entities, funds or schemes from the scope of this definition, but none of those exclusions is applicable in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">28 Section 601ED(1) provides, inter alia , that a managed investment scheme must be registered under s 601EB if it has more than 20 members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Neither the exemption in subs (2) nor subs (3) of s 601ED is applicable in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">29 Section 601ED(5) provides that a person must not operate in this jurisdiction a managed investment scheme that is required to be registered under s 601EB unless the scheme is so registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">30 Section 601EE(1) provides that if a person operates a managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) , ASIC may apply to the Court to have the scheme wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Court may make any orders that it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme in the event that ASIC makes an application of the kind described in s 601EE(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">31 On the evidence, the Scheme was a managed investment scheme that required registration, and it was not registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">By 25 October 2005, the Scheme had 134 members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It had approximately 127 members as at 17 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">32 Investors in the Scheme paid to receive a FullTank debit card and the rights and benefits which came with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Their subscription monies were pooled in bank accounts held by BTS which were invested by BTS at McDougall's direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The object was to produce financial returns which were promoted on the website as a saving on fuel costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">33 The members of the Scheme had no control over its day to day operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">They had no knowledge that the pooled funds were being partly transferred to a foreign exchange trading account with Forex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Nor did they know that subscription monies were being used by McDougall to pay some of his own personal expenses or those of his family and associates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">34 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 (" Pegasus "), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">His Honour said at [55]-[57]:
 
 "The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">
 6.</sentence>

 I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">He supervised others in their performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">
 
 I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus.</sentence>

35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">36 There is no doubt that McDougall was the person who formulated and directed the Scheme, and he was the directing mind and will of BTS in its day to day operations in relation to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Accordingly, I find that both McDougall and BTS operated the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">37 After these proceedings were commenced and after Merkel J had made interlocutory orders on 25 October 2005, McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in a different form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He procured McMillan to solicit members to forgive existing Scheme debts on the promise of equivalent interests in a new scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">38 The defendants were represented at the hearing of this proceeding by Mr Erlich of counsel.</sentence>

<sentence id="s177">Mr Erlich did not consent to the making of declarations of contravention, but he did not oppose that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">THE DEFENDANTS CARRIED ON AN UNLICENSED FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS 
 
39 Section 911A provides that a person who carries on a financial services business in this jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">In my opinion, both defendants contravened this provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">They carried on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services under the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">40 Section 761A provides that a financial service business is a business of providing financial services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">In my opinion, BTS was providing a financial service when it promoted, offered and issued memberships in the Scheme
 
41 To explain this conclusion, it is necessary to trace through the statutory concepts of "financial investment", "financial product" and "financial services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">42 Section 763B provides that:
 
 "For the purposes of this Chapter, a person (the investor) makes a financial investment if: 
 
 (a) the investor gives money or money's worth (the contribution) to another person and any of the following apply: 
 (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; 
 (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); 
 (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); and 
 (b) the investor has no day-to-day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">" 
 
 

43 Investors in the Scheme paid money to BTS who used it to generate a financial return or benefit for the member by providing a return that was applied to generate the fuel discount or saving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Investors intended that BTS would use their contributions to generate a financial return in the form of fuel discounts or savings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The members had no day-to-day control over the use of their contributions to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It does not matter that the Scheme failed to generate returns or benefits of the kind, or to the extent, represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It follows that, by investing in the Scheme, members made a financial investment within the meaning of s 763B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">44 Section 763A(1) provides that a financial product includes a facility through which, or through the acquisition of which, a person makes a financial investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The FullTank Scheme satisfies this description; it offers or represents a facility through which investors make a financial investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The Scheme is therefore a financial product within the meaning of s 763A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">45 The Scheme also constitutes a financial product within the meaning of s 764A(1)(ba).</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Under this provision an interest in a managed investment scheme that is not a registered scheme, but which is required to be registered by s 601ED(1) , constitutes a financial product for the purposes of ch 7 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">46 Section 761E(4) provides: 
 
 "Subject to this section, the issuer, in relation to a financial product issued to a person (the client), is the person responsible for the obligations owed, under the terms of the facility that is the product: 
 
 (a) to, or to a person nominated by, the client; or 
 (b) if the product has been transferred from the client to another person and is now held by that person or another person to whom it has subsequently been transferred--to, or to a person nominated by, that person or that other person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">" 
 

47 In this case, it is plain that BTS qualifies as an issuer of the financial product constituted by the Scheme or interests in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">BTS is a person responsible for the obligations owed under the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The website states that Chargeitcards is owned and operated by BTS and that Chargeitcards guarantees that if for any reason it was not able to maintain the weekly payments, then every member affected would receive a pro-rata refund of the first 10 weeks membership less any payment made to the members' card account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">By promoting, offering and managing the Scheme, BTS was dealing in a financial product for the purposes of s 766C(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">48 Section 766A(1)(b) provides that a person provides a financial service if they deal in a financial product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Accordingly, by dealing in a financial product BTS was also providing a financial service for the purposes of ch 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">49 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that BTS was carrying on a financial services business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It required a licence to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">As BTS did not hold a licence, it contravened s 911A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">50 I consider that McDougall, as the sole director and controller of BTS and as one of the registered owners of the business name Chargeitcards, was also carrying on an unlicensed financial services business in contravention of s 911A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Further and in any event, McDougall was acting as a representative of BTS in offering and promoting memberships in the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">As such, McDougall was only exempt from the requirement that he hold an Australian financial services licence if BTS itself held such a licence, and it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">51 Numerous cases have held that s 911A of the Act extends to a company director who conducts or is involved in a company's carrying on of a financial services business without an Australian financial services licence: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Giann &amp; Giann Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 81 ; (2005) 141 FCR 278; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Manito Pty Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 56; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 68.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">52 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that BTS and McDougall each contravened the provisions of s 911A by carrying on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of financial services under or in connection with the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">DECLARATORY RELIEF 
 
53 ASIC has sought declarations that the defendants contravened s 601ED(5) and s 911A of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">It is very clear that this Court has power pursuant to ss 21 , 22 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make the declarations that have been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">54 In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564, at 581-582, Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Their Honours added that it is a discretionary power which it is neither possible nor desirable to fetter by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise, although it must be recognised that it is a power confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In the same case, Brennan J emphasised that the making of a declaration, and the terms in which it is to be made, are in the court's discretion: at 596.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">56 The contraventions in this case were extremely serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It is an understatement to say that the Scheme involved extremely high risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The website promoting the Scheme misrepresented the nature of the investment and withheld vital information from investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The nature and extent of the risks attending the Scheme were not disclosed in any way to investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">No proper books and records were kept concerning the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Moreover, the Scheme's assets were dissipated, in part, on the personal expenses of McDougall and his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">57 McDougall also attempted to revive the Scheme in another form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">In doing so, he was prepared to act in breach of the interlocutory orders made by Merkel J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">There is a clear public interest in making declarations that will record the contraventions of the Act , and express the Court's strong disapproval of the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">58 The defendants do not oppose the making of declaratory orders in the form sought by ASIC, although they stop short of consenting to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the grant of declaratory relief in the form sought by ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">With one minor adjustment, I am satisfied that the terms of the declarations are clear and precise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The adjustment I have made is simply a revision of the definition of the Scheme set out in the schedule to the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 
 
59 ASIC seeks injunctive orders restraining the defendants from further operating or promoting the Scheme, and from further dealing in financial products in connection with the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">These orders are sought pursuant to ss 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In my opinion, these orders are entirely appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">60 In addition, ASIC seeks injunctive orders in the somewhat wider form set out in par 5 of the draft orders: see par 5 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">This form of order extends beyond the conduct of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In effect, it seeks to restrain the defendants from promoting, establishing or carrying on the business of any managed investment scheme that requires registration but which has not been registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">61 Although the defendants have consented to injunctive orders in this wider form, I propose to address the question whether ss 1101B and 1324 (1) authorise the making of injunctive orders in this wider form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Section 1101B(1) provides:
 
 
 "(1) The Court may make such order, or orders, as it thinks fit if: 
 
 
 (a) on the application of ASIC, it appears to the Court that a person: 
 (i) has contravened a provision of this Chapter, or any other law relating to dealing in financial products or providing financial services; or 
 (ii) ... 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 However, the Court can only make such an order if the Court is satisfied that the order would not unfairly prejudice any person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">" 
 
 
 

62 Section 1101B(4) is also relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">It provides, inter alia :
 
 "(4) Without limiting subsection (1), some examples of orders the Court may make under subsection (1) include: 
 (a) an order restraining a person from carrying on a business, or doing an act or classes of acts, in relation to financial products or financial services, if the person has persistently contravened, or is continuing to contravene: 
 (i) a provision or provisions of this Chapter; or 
 (ii) a provision or provisions of any other law relating to dealing in financial products or providing financial services; or 
 ... 
 
 ... 
 
 (f) an order restraining a person from providing any financial services that are specified in the order; and 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (j) any ancillary order considered to be just and reasonable in consequence of the making of an order under any of the preceding provisions of this subsection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">" 
 
 

It is significant that the orders may extend to orders restraining a person from doing a class of acts in relation to financial products or services if the person has persistently contravened a provision of the Chapter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">63 Section 1324(1) is also expressed in wide terms:
 
 
 "(1) Where a person has engaged, is engaging or is proposing to engage in conduct that constituted, constitutes or would constitute: 
 
 
 (a) a contravention of this Act ; or 
 (b) attempting to contravene this Act ; or 
 (c) aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene this Act ; or 
 (d) inducing or attempting to induce, whether by threats, promises or otherwise, a person to contravene this Act ; or 
 (e) being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of this Act ; or 
 (f) conspiring with others to contravene this Act ; 
 
 the Court may, on the application of ASIC, or of a person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct, grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, restraining the first-mentioned person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, requiring that person to do any act or thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">" 
 

64 Section 1324 permits the Court to grant an injunction "on such terms as the court thinks appropriate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">These words echo the concluding words of s 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("TPA") which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">These words were introduced into s 80(1) by a 1983 amendment to the TPA, which, to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500 at 508, freed the power conferred by s 80 from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">65 The operation of s 80(1) of the TPA was canvassed by the Full Court of this Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 (" ICI ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Lockhart J described s 80(1) as a public interest provision which attracts special considerations; it represents a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation: at 254-255.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">After referring to subss 80(4) and (5), Lockhart J said: 
 
 "Injunctions are traditionally employed to restrain repetition of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A statutory provision that enables an injunction to be granted to prevent the commission of conduct that has never been done before and is not likely to be done again is a statutory enlargement of traditional equitable principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Public interest injunctions are different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees, have decided are contrary to the public interest (contracts, arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely (s 45)), the misuse of market power (s 46) , the practice of exclusive dealing (s 47) , resale price maintenance (s 48) , price discrimination (s 49) , anti-competitive mergers (s 50) and unfair practices with respect to consumers (Pt V).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">These are legislative enactments of matters vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">" 
 

In his Honour's view, the section would in an appropriate case authorise the Court to grant an injunction against a respondent preventing him in engaging in conduct which is similar to the conduct which constituted, or would constitute, a contravention of the Act : at 261.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Lockhart J also agreed (at 261) with the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 632 that in an appropriate case the court may grant an injunction to restrain the respondent from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance notwithstanding that only some of the acts falling within s 96(3) were found to have been so committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">66 Gummow J said at 267:
 
 " Section 80(1) confers upon the court the power to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in pars (a)-(f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The power of the court to grant an injunction is controlled by the words 'in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 
 Thus, the terms of the injunction will not be 'appropriate' if, on its face, it operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The injunction should not prohibit conduct falling outside the boundaries drawn by s 80: see Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The same limitation applies to mandatory injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">It is, in my view, no support for the grant of an injunction which, from the outset, has an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 , to say that it is open for the party enjoined to apply under s 80(3) to vary the injunction so as to bring its operation wholly within proper limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The party in question should not be placed under any such obligation in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">" 
 

The statement that the terms of an injunction will not be appropriate if it "operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act " is somewhat ambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">However, at first blush at least, it suggests a narrower approach to s 80 than that described by Lockhart J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">67 French J said that s 80 was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V. His Honour added at 268:
 
 "There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The possibility remains open, by virtue of s 80(3) , that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">
 
 The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">This was a proper case for the grant of that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">" 
 

68 In ACCC v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197 at 202 at [D]-[E], after referring to these passages in ICI , Merkel J said:
 
 "The width of the power conferred by s 80 and its public interest character obviously give the Court great amplitude in determining appropriate injunctive orders in a particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">However there are limitations on the Court's power under the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Confinement of the power by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA, and in particular s 80 , is one limitation on the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">However, there are at least two further limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The power to make orders under s 80 is only enlivened in a proceeding which alleges that there has been a contravention of a provision of Pt IV , IVA or V of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">As was said by Gummow J in ICI at 267, the terms of an injunction granted under s 80 must, on their face, operate upon a range of conduct which has 'the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s 80(1) or 80 (1AA) there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">" 
 

69 It is implicit in Merkel J's judgment that an injunction under s 80 may extend beyond the specific conduct proven to constitute a contravention by s 80 and may, in appropriate cases, extend to conduct of the same kind or class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">There must, however, be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct that is the subject of the restraint and the conduct that was alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute (WA) [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 131, the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">70 Most recently, in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 , a Full Court (comprising Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI .</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Their Honours said at [30]-[31]:
 
 "His Honour's reference to terms having 'an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 ' is no more than a paraphrase of the actual words of the subsection 'such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">' That paraphrase, we consider with respect, does not illuminate the amplitude which should be given, as a matter of construction, to the grant of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">In our view, a more helpful guide to resolving the question of construction is afforded by this observation, also from ICI v Trade Practices Commission , of Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) at 256; 
 
 
 'In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pt IV or V of the Act ), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">' 
 
 
 
 This approach of Lochkhart J accords with the view often expressed by the High Court that discretions or powers entrusted to Courts should be read liberally for the relevant statutory purpose, without making implications or imposing limitations not found in the express words: Australian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at [77] and see generally for the cases Hewlett Packard v GE Capital [2003] FCAFC 256 ; (2003) 203 ALR 51 at [187] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">" 
 

Thus, the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">71 The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s 80 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">As the Full Court explained, this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court's power under s 80 and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction:
 
 "In our view, the need, suggested by the authorities, for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J's insistence that the power be exercised 'judicially and sensibly'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s 80(1) , not to the extent of the power to grant it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">If the Court considers that a complete prohibition, whether permanently or for a specified period, on a respondent's engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention, s 80 is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">This analysis of s 80 conforms, we consider, with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 at 504 [110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">" 
 

The Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus, as the evidence and the trial judge's findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would, unless restrained, commit further conduct of the same general kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">In these circumstances, it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention: at [34] and [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">72 In the present case, I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate, especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">There is, in my opinion, a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par 5 of the draft orders, and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">In all the circumstances, I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted, and that it will serve the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">WINDING UP THE SCHEME 
 
73 ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">A number of ancillary orders are sought, including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The defendants consent to these orders being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The first alteration, in par 7, identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par 9 are the individuals identified in the above par 7 of the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">74 In ASIC v Takaran Pty Ltd (No 2) (2003) 194 ALR 743 at 747-748, at [15], Barrett J made the following observation, with which I agree:
 
 "The fact that a scheme is being operated by its existing operators in contravention of statute activates a public interest in favour of not only its being wound up under s 601EE ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488) but also 'ensuring the transparency of the winding up process and the safeguarding of the rights of the contributories' by committing the winding up to an independent party ( Bells Securities Pty Ltd v LPG Mourant [2002] QSC 156 ; BC200202989 per Wilson J; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Product Management Group Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 343).</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">" 
 

75 In this case, it makes eminent good sense that the existing Court appointed receivers be appointed as the joint and several liquidators of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">76 The defendants have also consented to orders which are designed to ensure that the liquidation does not result in any shortfall to investors in the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Specifically, the defendants have consented to orders that they will pay to the liquidators the sum of $80,000.00 to be applied by the liquidators in accordance with s 556 of the Act as if references to the company were a reference to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">To guard against the risk that the sum of $80,000.00 is not sufficient to ensure that there is no shortfall in discharging all of the liabilities of the Scheme, the defendants have consented to a further order that they will pay any such shortfall to the liquidators within 21 days of receiving a call for payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] --- [98].</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">78 In the present case, I must bear in mind that the defendants have been prepared to consent to orders that will ensure that there is no shortfall in the winding up of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I also recognise that the solvency of BTS depends, ultimately, on the availability of support from McDougall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">In these circumstances, and given that ASIC has not sought a winding up order in respect of BTS, I have concluded that there it is not necessary to make a winding up order in respect of BTS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">This is not a case in which ASIC has suggested that the recovery for investors will be maximised by ordering a winding up of both the Scheme and the company which administered the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">THE RECEIVER'S COSTS 
 
79 On 6 December 2005, I made an order by consent that the costs and expenses of the receivers were determined to be $30,831.00 and that this sum be paid to them from the funds received by them in the course of the receivership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">The receivers have filed an affidavit which indicates that this figure was mistakenly calculated in that it did not make full allowance for all of the outstanding costs and expenses of the receivers at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Further receivership costs have been incurred since 6 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">80 The receivers' costs are addressed in par 9 of the orders I propose to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Paragraph 9 provides that the reasonable costs and expenses of the receivers (referred to in par 7) and of the winding up of the Scheme, including the professional costs and expenses of the liquidators, shall be paid out of the assets of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Paragraph 7 of the orders identifies the receivers as Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart and appoints them as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">I am satisfied that this form of order is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">COSTS 
 
81 The defendants have consented to an order that they pay ASIC's costs of the proceedings, and I will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">I certify that the preceding eighty-one (81) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young J.</sentence>
