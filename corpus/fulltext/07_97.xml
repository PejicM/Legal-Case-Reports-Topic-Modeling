 OUTLINE OF ISSUES 
 
1 In mid 1999 three businessmen, John Bax, Fred Gulson and John Reece, through their shareholdings in and directorships of BGR Corporation Pty Ltd, gained control of the Main Star One group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">That group was involved in the production, distribution and sale of tea tree oil and its products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Initially Mr Gulson's company, The Triad Health Products Group of Companies Pty Ltd, held 70.4% of the shares in BGR, Mr Bax's company, The Food Improvers Pty Ltd held 22.2% and Mr Reece's company, Karcor Holdings Pty Ltd, held 7.4%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Sometime shortly after the beginning of July 1999, Mr Gulson caused Triad to transfer 7.4% of the shares in BGR to Cordato Partners (Services) Pty Limited, a company controlled by his law school friend and a solicitor, Mr Tony Cordato.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece carried out the functions of the senior management of the businesses, which were known as Main Camp, after the takeover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They did so in accordance with a business plan which Mr Bax prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Mr Cordato provided the business with legal services, but did not play a role as a director or executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In July 1999 each of Triad, Food Improvers and Karcor entered into consultancy agreements, which Mr Cordato had drafted, with a Main Camp company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In July 2000 replacement consultancy agreements were made with BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">All the consultancy agreements provided for the payment to each consultant company of $20,833.33 per month for, inter alia, the provision of services by its respective principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 In March 2001 the consultancy fees ceased to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">There is a substantial issue as to the terms on which that occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Bax and Mr Reece say that invoicing of the fees was suspended but that in the future invoices could be rendered and payments would be made for services provided if and when the Main Camp group could afford to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato say that there was no arrangement deferring rendering, or for the payment of, consultancy fees if they had not been invoiced contemporaneously with the provision of the services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Later, after a dispute in 2002, Mr Reece relinquished his shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The holdings of the remaining three shareholders from then on were Triad 68%, Food Improvers 24% and Cordato 8% of the shares in BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 After Mr Reece's departure, Jim Gobert, an expert in the use of and applications of tea tree oil products, took up the role of marketing manager of the group as an employee, but not as a shareholder or partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 Eventually in about mid 2003, the payment of consultancy fees recommenced, but at much reduced rates, though there were increases later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Bax's and Mr Gulson's companies received consultancy fees thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 In early 2005 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Gobert were planning an overseas trip to market tea tree oil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Gobert was also to have discussions with European regulators about standards that were then being contemplated that would affect the sale of tea tree products within the European Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They arrived in Europe in the latter part of May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Gulson began to exhibit quite erratic behaviour as a result of a psychiatric condition which he had and which worsened during this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 On 29 May 2005, in circumstances which I will describe in more detail below, Mr Gulson, without any prior discussion with Mr Bax, summarily dismissed Mr Gobert in London for no good reason on the eve of important meetings with an Israeli customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Bax then said that he could no longer work with Mr Gulson and refused to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Gulson attended the meetings with the Israeli customer that had been scheduled the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">All three men made their way home, Messrs Bax and Gobert travelling together and Mr Gulson separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mr Gulson returned and immediately went to the Main Camp plantation in Northern New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">His erratic behaviour became more and more pronounced and caused alarm to the plantation manager, Mr Williams, and staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">8 On 8 June 2005 Mr Gulson met in Sydney with Mr Cordato and Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Gulson was adamant that Mr Gobert would not be reinstated, although Mr Bax had already re-employed him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Bax said that he would not work with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Cordato was at that time trying to hold what was obviously a highly fractious position together as best he could so that the parties could co-operate to effect the sale of the Main Camp undertaking and an orderly dissolution of the business relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, on 10 June 2005 Mr Gulson caused an extraordinary general meeting of BGR to be called for 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The business of that meeting was to remove Mr Bax as a director, ratify Mr Gulson's summary dismissal of Mr Gobert, and his termination of Food Improvers' consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Because Mr Gulson's shareholding was sufficient, the July meeting proceeded to do so with Mr Cordato's support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In the meantime, Mr Gulson had been admitted to the Northside Clinic psychiatric hospital for treatment for his condition which had by then become quite unstable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Thereafter, Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato substantively exercised control over the direction of BGR to the exclusion of Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In mid July 2005 Food Improvers and Mr Bax commenced these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 In mid September the 2005 the parties met and agreed to appoint an agent for sale of the Main Camp business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">After the meeting Mr Bax prepared two suggested methods of distribution one of which involved a recognition that Food Improvers was owed $500,000 for consultancy fees and that after payment of this amount, the balance of the net proceeds of sale of the Main Camp plantation and business would be distributed to the shareholders by BGR as a fully franked dividend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">After that distribution the shareholders would repay their loan accounts, which were substantial, and BGR would then make a further fully franked dividend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">This became known as 'option B'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Correspondence ensued in which Mr Cordato, acting as the solicitor for all of the defendants, confirmed that the distribution would be made in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">10 But once the sale had been completed, without notice to Mr Bax, the distribution was ultimately made simply on the basis of shareholding entitlements without any payment recognizing Mr Bax's claim for consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Earlier, when the Main Camp sale was about to be settled, Mr Cordato's solicitors' firm, Cordato Partners, issued 16 accounts totalling about $135,000 in respect of matters in which his firm had acted since 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Those accounts were paid very promptly from the sale proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">11 The proceedings have been conducted with considerable feeling on all sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">At issue are the claims that Mr Bax and Food Improvers make, namely that:
 
 
 &#8226; BGR was in effect a quasi partnership consisting of initially himself, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece, and later himself and Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr Cordato was more of a silent investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In this quasi partnership, Mr Bax was the managing director or chief executive, Mr Gulson was the corporate counsel and company secretary and Mr Reece, originally, was to be involved in running the Main Camp farm and marketing its products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Mr Gobert succeeded to Mr Reece's functions but not his equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">&#8226; Mr Gulson used his controlling shareholding in BGR and the ultimate alliance of Mr Cordato, to engage in oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">That conduct began with the summary dismissal in London of Mr Gobert in the middle of the overseas trip and then Mr Gulson's use of his majority shareholding to exclude Mr Bax from any role in BGR contrary to the quasi-partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Mr Gulson used his voting power to impose his will at the meeting of 1 July 2005, with Mr Cordato's support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">&#8226; Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato used and are using the resources of BGR to pay Cordato Partners for all of their companies' litigation costs against Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">They have excluded him from important decisions as to the terms of sale and the making of the distribution following the sale of Main Camp business, having previously represented to him that option B would be the method of distribution of the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">&#8226; Mr Gulson continues to cause BGR to pay Triad a consultancy fee of $20,833 each month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">&#8226; Mr Cordato and his firm ought not to act as solicitor for all of the defendants because it is oppressive or he has a conflict of interest and lack of independence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">&#8226; The parties actually entered into a contract to cause the distribution of the proceeds of Main Camp sale to be made in accordance with the methodology in option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 

12 Although there is a large number of evidentiary conflicts, the real substance of the dispute falls within a much narrower compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">At the heart of the case are the questions of:
 
 
 &#8226; how the parties agreed that they would conduct the Main Camp business in 1999;
 &#8226; what arrangement was made for cessation of payments of consultancy fees in March 2001;
 &#8226; the circumstances and consequences of the resumption of payment of the consultancy fees;
 &#8226; the justification for the respective parties' positions in May and June 2005;
 &#8226; the question as to whether the conduct of BGR by Mr Gulson alone or with Mr Cordato gave rise to a right to relief on the just and equitable ground or amounted to oppression of Food Improvers;
 &#8226; whether there was a contract for the distribution of the proceeds of sale of the Main Camp business in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 

 MID 1999 --- BASIS OF RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES 
 
13 When negotiations for the acquisition of the Main Star One group were reaching their conclusion, Mr Bax was chief executive officer of the Ink Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">He had been a fellow of CPA Australia (an association of chartered accountants) since the early 1980s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Prior that he held senior managerial roles, including chief financial officer of a publicly listed trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">14 The principal companies in the group were:
 
 
 &#8226; Main Camp Holdings Pty Limited, which owned land known as Main Camp on which a tea tree oil farming business was operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">That involved the growing of tea trees, distillation of tea tree oil, selling the tea tree oil and the supply of tea tree mulch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Some other agricultural activities were also conducted on the property including the running of cattle, growing of soy beans, barley and timber.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">&#8226; Main Camp Corporation Pty Limited purchased tea-tree oil from Main Camp Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It sold Main Camp branded tea tree oil to domestic and international customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">&#8226; SNP Natural Products Pty Limited purchased non-branded tea tree oil from Main Camp Holdings and third parties together with Australian native herbs and spices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It on sold its own branded tea tree oil products and Australian native herbs and spices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">SNP also conducted all head office operations with the BGR Group and its sales and marketing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">&#8226; Advanced Technology Research Pty Limited, was a non operating entity which held claims against the failed Australian Rural Group Limited (in liq).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">&#8226; Business and Research Management Limited, known as BARM, was an also non operating entity which an outstanding objection against the Australian Taxation Office for a tax refund of about $9.2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

15 In late June 1999 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece met at Mr Reece's Gladesville offices on a Saturday morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Bax presented a paper entitled 'Strategic and Short Term Business Plan for the Control and Operation of the Main Star One Group' in anticipation of BGR's imminent completion of the take over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The plan referred to the Main Star One Group's complex corporate structure and unique processes of operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">One objective was to seek the co-operation of Mr Glen Stotter, who was a principal in the management of the Main Star One Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Mr Bax emphasized that the staff of the Main Star One Group had quickly to form the view that BGR was professional in its manner and was acting in the staff's and the investors' best interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There had been extensive litigation concerning the Main Star One Group in the 1990s (see the judgments of Hill J in Natural Extracts Pty Limited v Stotter (1997) 24 ACSR 110; [1997] FCA 471 and Hely J in Natural Extracts Pty Limited (now called Benchmark Essential Oils Pty Limited (in liq)) v Stotter [1998] FCA 1636).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">16 The plan recorded that the appointment of an appropriate managing director was critical in order to provide a clear and unequivocal statement to staff and external parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The managing director had to liaise directly with Mr Stotter and be seen by investors in the tax schemes for tea tree oil products as a suitable person to take over his role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Mr Bax proposed that he be the managing director of the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece were each to hold the position of director of BGR and each would have specific areas of responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The plan proposed that all executive directors would report to the managing director, but they would all have equal say on a business direction and planning issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The latter class of decisions would be made at board meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">A number of strategies for the running of the business was proposed and a short term business plan was outlined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">17 The plan proposed that each of the three would have particular responsibilities which reflected the skills that he brought separately to the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Mr Bax was have responsibility for all financial and administrative functions, liaising with Mr Stotter, licensed dealers and investors and dealing with future acquisition proposals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Gulson was to be general counsel, having responsibility for all commercial legal matters pertaining to the operations of the group, settlement of outstanding litigation, company secretarial functions, government relations and managing special assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He was also designated to have responsibility for insurance (although in the event he did not, but nothing turns on this).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Mr Reece was to have responsibility for agricultural, operational and technical matters, relations with consultants acting on the various projects of the group, commercialization of research investments known as 'Budplan' products, supervision of the Main Camp plantation and the sales of tea tree oil and related products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">18 Mr Bax spoke to his plan after the others had read it in Mr Reece's office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He said that he had met with all the senior executives and directors of the Main Star One Group and they were concerned about its future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He noted his previous experiences as chief executive officer and in senior management of other businesses and proposed that he be appointed as managing director of BGR and all of its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He then explained Mr Gulson's role based on his legal background as a solicitor, should be as company secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Bax envisaged that Mr Gulson would be able to use his connections with various government departments which he had developed when he was with New South Wales Farmers and he could concentrate on running of the BARM litigation with the Australian Tax Office and potential investor groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">That litigation involved a claim by BARM, a subsidiary of the group, for a refund of many millions of dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It is yet to be heard by a judge of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">19 Mr Bax proposed that Mr Reece's role be to develop the markets for the sale of the products, look after the Main Camp farm, and pursue the commercialization of the research from the Budplan projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">20 Both Mr Gulson and Mr Reece agreed with Mr Bax's proposals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">They decided to hold regular weekly management meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They all agreed to hold regular board meetings because there were two non listed public companies in the group as well as other finance companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">They agreed that they would appoint a chairman at each meeting to handle the role and that there was no need for a permanent position of chairman to be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Gulson observed that was a good idea that a chairman could be appointed at meetings from whomever was present because of the travel commitments each of them would have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">MR BAX WAS MANAGING DIRECTOR 
 
21 Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato sought to assert during the hearing that Mr Bax's use of the title of managing director did not properly reflect his role in the running of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I reject their evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Each was an unsatisfactory witness on this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Although there was no formal appointment of Mr Bax as managing director by any board resolution, once BGR assumed control of the group on 2 July 1999, Mr Bax began to act as managing director with the knowledge of Mr Cordato, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The group required a managing director or chief executive to run it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He continued in that role until June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Throughout this time, he was recognised by the staff and external parties who dealt with the BGR group as managing director or chief executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">His name appeared in correspondence with third parties, including the group's financiers and customers, in the capacity of managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">His business cards were printed with his capacity so described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">22 Mr Reece, who had no reason to be favourable to any party in the litigation, confirmed that Mr Bax was recognised as and acted as managing director throughout Mr Reece's time with BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Williams also confirmed this was so up to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">23 In evidence, Mr Gulson agreed that when the three partners took over the Main Camp business in July 1999 the 45 to 50 staff needed to know who was the 'boss', managing director or chief executive officer, and that all three directors had agreed at that time Mr Bax was to be managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In early June 2005 Mr Gulson began calling himself 'interim managing director' in correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">On 7 June 2005 Mr Gulson drafted a letter for Mr Cordato to review before Mr Gulson sent it to Mr Bax's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Gulson referred to having letters on file from 'the former managing director'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I find that this description not only reflected how Mr Gulson saw Mr Bax but also the reality that Mr Bax was the managing director of BGR and its group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">24 Mr Cordato gave evidence about a meeting with Mr Bax and Mr Gulson on 8 June 2005 when they discussed Mr Williams' fax of that day addressed to Mr Bax as CEO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">There, Mr Williams had complained of Mr Gulson's irrational behaviour the previous day and its impact on the staff and business of Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Cordato said that whole fax concerned him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He told both Mr Bax and Mr Gulson that this could not continue and '... somebody's got to sort him [Mr Williams] out and calm him down'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Cordato said that Mr Bax had responsibility for sorting out the way in which Mr Gulson was behaving towards Mr Williams because Mr Bax brought Mr Williams' fax into the meeting and '.... he was the CEO'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The evidence continued:
 
 
 '(MR LEVER:) 'But did you not speak to Fred Gulson to try and sort Fred Gulson out to stop him behaving in the way that Dennis Williams was complaining about?---That was one reason I asked for the meeting of 8 June 2005, to sort out the inter alia for this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Mr Cordato, why would a chief financial officer have responsibility for sorting things out with the staff who were running the plantation business - - -?---He sent - - - 
 - - - and not the chief executive officer?---Well, Mr Williams thought of him as a chief executive officer , which is what CEO would imply to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">' (emphasis added)
 

25 I find Mr Cordato's evidence on this issue to be implausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Mr Cordato sought to downplay Mr Bax's role by describing it as that of chief financial officer when he knew that was a false description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">As his evidence showed, he had no basis for that description which he volunteered despite his knowledge that Mr Bax was regarded by the plantation manager, represented on business cards and to the staff as managing director or chief executive officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Indeed Mr Cordato said Mr Bax had been acting as such for two or three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I do not believe the limitation he put in that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I find that Mr Cordato knew that Mr Bax was the managing director and chief executive officer from about the time BGR took over the Main Camp business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">26 The reason for Mr Cordato's expectation that Mr Bax should 'sort out' Mr Williams was that the former was the managing director in Mr Cordato's mind, and had always been so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">And, as he said, he did nothing himself to 'sort out' Mr Gulson although he recognised that Mr Gulson then appeared agitated and to have periods of irrationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I find that Mr Cordato was conscious Mr Gulson was behaving in the way which Mr Williams described and Mr Cordato endeavoured, at the meeting on 8 June 2005, to have Mr Bax's authority with the staff restored so that Mr Gulson's disruptive behaviour would not threaten their investment in the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">27 In closing address the defendants conceded that the parties conducted their affairs in the way that had been contemplated in the meeting in Mr Reece's office in June 1999 and that a quasi partnership existed between Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece from that point forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The defendants also then conceded that Mr Bax, as a matter of fact, acted as managing director or chief executive officer of the group, notwithstanding that there was no formal appointment to that office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Each of the three had his agreed role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The respective corporate vehicle of each was paid an equal consultancy fee equally through and each regarded his performance of a significant management role as important to his place in the overall business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">28 I am satisfied that Mr Bax acted as managing director of BGR and the group with the knowing consent of Mr Gulson and Mr Reece and the knowledge of Mr Cordato until the events of June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Each of Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece performed in substance the roles assigned to them in Mr Bax's plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">29 Having seen and heard each of them, I am confident that they each sought to co-operate with one another in the running of the business and, until the circumstances involving Mr Reece's ceasing to be a part of the partnership, treated each other as partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Subsequently until 29 May 2005 Mr Bax and Mr Gulson treated each other as partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">And they made all significant decisions jointly and worked co-operatively in the operation of the business notwithstanding the disparity between the respective sizes of their companies' shareholdings in BGR, or the presence of Mr Cordato's company as another minor shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">CONSULTANCY AGREEMENTS 
 
30 Food Improvers and Mr Bax entered into a consultancy agreement with Main Star One Holdings Pty Limited on 2 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">That agreement provided that the consultant (Food Improvers) was entitled to a consultancy fee of $20,833.33 payable monthly in advance from 5 July 1999 unless otherwise agreed (cl 4.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">A similar consultancy agreement was entered into by Main Star One Holdings with Karcor and Mr Reece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">I infer that a similar position applied to Triad and Mr Gulson even though the actual consultancy agreement was not in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">31 New consultancy agreements replaced these from 1 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">They were between BGR and each of the principals and their respective service companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The BGR consultancy agreements contained a provision for the payment of consultancy fees which was relevantly identical to that in cl 4.1 in the earlier agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The consultancy fee payable under cl 4.1 was exclusive of GST (which commenced to be payable from 1 July 2000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The consultant was required to charge GST and show it separately on an invoice issued to BGR at the end of each month so that the amount payable would include GST (cl 10.11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">There was an initial term of one year, but the agreements were to continue afterwards unless terminated by three months' notice in writing or in accordance with a right of BGR to terminate the consultancy immediately provided in cl 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">BGR's CASH FLOW DIFFICULTIES 
 
32 From July 1999 until approximately late 2003 the BGR group incurred significant legal costs in a number of pieces of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It also required a high level of working capital to operate the 4,500 hectare Main Camp plantation which had 55 million tea-trees planted and a staff of approximately 25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The market for tea-tree oil was at that time over supplied and the price for tea-tree oil decreased from $45 per kilo in 1999 to about $24 per kilo in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">33 In about October 2000 four new tractors were required to be leased each which would cost approximately $440,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Leasing finance initially, was not approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The group's cash position tightened and in about December 2000 Mr Bax called a meeting with Mr Gulson and Mr Reece at his office in Phillip Street, Sydney in which Mr Bax told the others that his examination of the current and future levels of expenditure against projected incomes revealed cash flow problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He told them of the need to fund the test cases, and the difficulties that running a table grape farm at Jabiru, in the Northern Territory, meant that business could not be operated at a profit because of obligations under a prospectus and the disputes with Australian Rural Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Moreover, he pointed out the deteriorating market price of tea-tree oil and suggested that in the next few months BGR would need a cash injection of several hundred thousand dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He suggested that it would be up to the three of them to provide financial support because the business was basically managing projects which was not something a financier would find attractive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">MARCH 2001 MEETING: SUSPENSION OF CONSULTANCY FEES --- LOANS TO BGR 
 
34 Over the next three months to March 2001 a number of other meetings concerning cash flow issues took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Then, critically, in March 2001 Mr Bax called Messrs Gulson and Reece to another meeting in their offices in Phillip Street Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">35 Mr Bax said that the time had come and that the business needed another $500,000 according to his calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It was not turning around and the price of tea-tree oil was still going down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">He said it was a shareholder issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Mr Gulson asked what that meant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Mr Bax said that BGR could not sustain consultancy fees for the three of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He suggested that they repay some fees and that should be done in effect in proportion to their shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Thus, he suggested that Mr Gulson should repay $315,000, Mr Reece $37,000 and Mr Bax $111,000 inclusive of GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr Reece said that seemed fair to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Mr Gulson noted it obliged him to contribute a lot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Mr Bax pointed out that he was the largest shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">36 Mr Gulson observed that he would have to borrow funds and pay interest and that they should be able to charge interest back to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Mr Bax said in evidence that Mr Gulson also asserted that the consultancy fees should be brought up to date as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Mr Gulson said because they all would be borrowing and have no income from consultancy fees, the company should pay interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Bax agreed with that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Reece said that he could not borrow money and that he would want his consultancy fees brought up to date as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Mr Bax said that there was no need for them to continue to put in more invoices for their consultancy fees because BGR had no money to pay it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Any invoices would involve their companies becoming liable to tax although they would not have been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">So, he suggested they stop issuing invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The others agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">37 Mr Reece had no reason to give evidence favouring one party against the other in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">His account was that Mr Bax said that they would have to suspend the consultancy fees rather than cancelling them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Mr Bax pointed out that if the fees were cancelled Mr Reece, for one, would only obtain remuneration or reward by way of distribution on the basis of shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">That would mean that Mr Gulson would earn nine times more than Mr Reece although Mr Reece was working for the group full time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">And Mr Reece said there was mention of the fact that when the group got on top of things they would be reimbursed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">38 Mr Gulson contradicted Mr Bax's and Mr Reece's account of this meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">He said that Mr Bax had told them that consultancy fees would cease to be paid from then and that they had to lend BGR $500,000 in proportion to their shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Mr Gulson denied that Mr Bax referred to returning consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">39 In the event, a number of steps was taken in March 2001 and following by BGR's directors and members to offer the group financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">First, the BGR creditors ledger shows that each of the three consultants paid back consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">This was done by credit notes which were dated 1 March 2001 and the payments to BGR on 23 March 2001 of $183,333.30 by Triad, $111,000.00 by Food Improvers and $37,000 by Karcor as recorded in BGR's creditors ledger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">No corresponding entries occurred for Cordato Partners Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Secondly, Mr Gulson approached Mr Cordato and arranged for him to contribute $37,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">BGR's general ledger recorded loans being made on 23 March 2001 by Triad of $116,666.70 and on 26 March 2001 by Cordato Partners Services of $37,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">40 Thus in late March 2001 Triad paid a total of $300,000 to BGR, Food Improvers paid a total of $111,000 and Karcor and Cordato Partners Services had paid $37,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">These payments in late March 2001 provided a cash injection of $485,000.00 Thus Triad contributed 61.9% of that sum, Food Improvers, 22.9% while Karcor and Cordato Partners Services each contributed 7.6%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">41 Next, on 7 May 2001, BGR's general ledger records that Triad made a further loan of $157,500 (70.89%) and Food Improvers lent $55,500 (Ex 2; 4/120.1.3) of a total of $222,250.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">42 Last, on 8 June 2001, BGR's general ledger shows that Triad lent $40,000 (46.5%) Food Improvers lent $20,000, (23.3%) Karcor lent $8,000 (9.3%) and on 13 June 2001 Cordato Partners Services lent $18,000 (20.9%) totalling a further $86,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">43 Of the total of the loans made in May and June 2001 ($308,250), Triad contributed 64.1%, Food Improvers 24.5%, Karcor 5.6% and Cordato Partners Services 5.8%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">I am not satisfied that anyone remembered the precise conversations or reasons why the amounts paid in the period between March and June 2001 were paid in the proportions or way in which they are recorded in BGR's books but nothing turns on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Thus, in the three months to June 2001, the shareholders had paid $793,250 to BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Triad's share of the total payments by each shareholder represented 62.7% in respect of its 63% of the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Food Improvers had paid 23.5% compared to its shareholding of 22.2% and Karcor and Cordato Partners Services had paid 6.8% and 6.9% respectively as against their 7.4% shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Of that, $331,333.30 was recorded in BGR's creditor's ledger as a repayment of consulting fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Moreover, the three executives had ceased to render, through their companies, any invoices for consultancy fees, representing an ongoing notional contribution of $20,833.33 each per month on top of the amounts of fees repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">44 I infer that each of the shareholders made total payments in the three months to June 2001 in approximate proportion to their shareholdings in order to provide needed cash to BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">So, Mr Bax said in cross-examination, it was tax effective for the three consultants to return as much as they could by crediting consultancy fees previously earned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">This meant that they would not have to pay company tax on the fees returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">On the other hand, it is improbable that Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece were repaying those fees, once for all rather than lending notionally the equivalent sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The basis asserted by Mr Gulson would have meant that they could never reverse the repayment were BGR's fortunes to recover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">That would have resulted in each of the executives making a gift to BGR not only of the work which they had done up to then but also of what they had been paid for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">I am satisfied that Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece intended and understood that the consultancy fees which were repaid in March 2001 were always intended to be returned to the consultants if the BGR group could afford to do so in future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">45 Subsequently, on 22 September 2005, Mr Bax, Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson met with BGR's taxation accountant, Joe Lombardo of KPMG, Accountants at KPMG's offices to discuss possible distributions of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">I will return to this meeting below, but Mr Lombardo gave evidence that early in the meeting the following exchange occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">
 
 
 'Mr Bax: 'I am owed consultancy fees as marked on the first schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There are consultancy fees owed to each of us'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">He indicated Mr Gulson; 
 
 
 
 Mr Gulson: 'Yes that's right'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">
 
 
 
 Mr Bax: 'Because I have a lesser share in the company, I need to have my consultancy fees paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">'' 
 
 
 

46 The 'first schedule' was Mr Lombardo's description of option A prepared by Mr Bax; it claimed all amounts which could have been, but had not been, invoiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The admission by Mr Gulson that substantial consultancy fees were owing is consistent with Mr Bax's and Mr Reece's evidence as to what occurred in March 2001 when the payment of the fees was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Option A recorded that over $1,000,000 before interest was owed to each of Triad and Food Improvers as consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">And Mr Lombardo noted that when the discussion turned to option B, which recorded $500,000 as consultancy fees and interest payable to Food Improvers alone, he said that it seemed as if that sum had been agreed upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Mr Gulson was nodding in apparent agreement when the $500,000 sum was raised by Mr Bax as due and he, Mr Lombardo, proceeded on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">47 I have no hesitation in accepting Mr Lombardo's evidence as accurate and reliable and prefer it wherever it conflicts with Mr Cordato's or Mr Gulson's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Mr Lombardo had no reason to favour any party in his recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">He had cause to remember the discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">He was trying to dissuade Mr Bax from structuring Food Improvers receipt of the sale proceeds to include any sum for consultancy fees because it would be taxable, unlike a payment of the same sum as dividend (in light of the BGR group's franking credit position).</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">48 I am satisfied that at the meetings which occurred in March 2001, Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece decided that it would be pointless for any of them to cause their service companies to continue to issue monthly tax invoices since the BGR Group did not have sufficient cash with which to pay their consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, each of them continued to work full time in the management of the group in the expectation that if and when its fortunes turned around through their efforts, they would be entitled to render invoices for the work they had performed in the preceding period, including the period for which they had repaid the fees previously earned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">49 In the meantime they (through their service companies) drew down on their loan accounts with BGR as and when they needed funds to meet their living expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">This had the consequence that they did not receive income and, thus were not liable to pay tax on the loan receipts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Had their service companies rendered tax invoices each month and accrued the consultancy fees as a debt payable by BGR, the consequences would have been that those companies would have incurred tax liabilities due to the receipt of 'income' on an accrual basis and for GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">BGR would have incurred a corresponding liability, also on an accrual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">That would have reduced its profitability in its financial statements which could be shown to third parties, such as the group's financiers, and, neither the partners nor BGR would have benefited at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">By suspending the issuing of tax invoices until BGR's fortunes improved, the partners were supporting the fortunes of their enterprise without incurring pointless tax liabilities in respect of money that they knew would not be received at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">50 Likewise, in the first half of 2001 each partner saw it as important to support the group in the meantime by return of some of their consultancy fees and by providing loans to BGR in proportion to their shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The commercial rationale for coming to this conclusion is, in my view, compelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">There was no sense in Mr Bax or Mr Reece in particular, working full time for the group during the period of cash flow difficulties after forsaking once for all any entitlement to be paid for that work given that they obviously thought that they could turn the group's fortunes around.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">They were prepared to take the risk of working without secure remuneration during that period for the potential benefits that they would be paid for their past work when BGR was in a position to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Only if, despite this work, BGR failed, had they accepted the risk of not being paid at all for their work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">51 Mr Gulson's evidence was that, in effect, his co-partners had agreed to forego all right to receive any further remuneration until the group's fortunes improved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">He asserted that the right to fees had been cancelled not suspended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">It has suited his financial position since the events of mid 2005 to contend, but I do not accept that he believed that this occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Nor do I believe that Mr Gulson understood what was happening in the meetings in March 2001 in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It makes no commercial sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">There would be no rational reason why, if the group recovered its fortunes, the partners would not have wanted to reward themselves for the period in which they worked to bring about that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Quite the contrary, it would have been unfair as between the partners that Mr Gulson's equity of almost two-thirds of the shares would have benefited from the large amount of free work provided by his co-partners in a disproportionate amount to their rewards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">52 Indeed, Mr Reece's equity of 7.4% would have been improved by exactly the same amount as Mr Cordato's company's in circumstances where Mr Reece was working full time for nothing in the interests of BGR and Mr Cordato was not working in that way at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Moreover, Mr Cordato retained the right to render professional fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The behaviour of Mr Gulson in approving payment of Cordato Partners' legal fees in January 2006 reflected a recognition that those who supported the group through its cash flow difficulties would be paid for their work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Mr Cordato rendered professional fees in respect of work in progress and other matters which he had conducted over the whole of the period between July 1999 and January 2006 in sixteen separate accounts issued on 24 and 25 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">He did that when the proceeds from the Main Camp sale were about to be distributed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">53 Mr Gulson gave evidence that he had agreed much earlier with Mr Cordato that the latter should defer rendering his fees until such time as BGR could afford it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Before a short adjournment in the hearing, Mr Cordato denied that he had made such an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Following that adjournment Mr Cordato revealed, grudgingly, under cross-examination, that Mr Gulson had spoken to him in the toilet and sought to remind him that he had agreed with Mr Bax to a deferral of the rendering of his fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Mr Gulson gave no evidence to deny that he behaved in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It was in Mr Gulson's interest to establish an agreement by Mr Cordato so as to justify the later payment of Mr Cordato's fees, the rendering of which had been deferred until the BGR group was in a position to pay them as to distinguish his position from that of the executive directors in respect of their entitlement to uninvoiced consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Mr Cordato told Mr Gulson in the toilet that he had never made such an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">54 Mr Cordato, as an experienced litigation solicitor, was aware of the inappropriateness of this discussion while he was under cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">When first asked about the discussion he said he did not believe it was about the evidence he was giving, then that he could not remember.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">That was disingenuous of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Asked 'what were his [Mr Gulson's] words' he responded 'You were there', before finally divulging what Mr Gulson suggested to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">I can understand that the incident was embarrassing to him, but Mr Cordato was evasive and far from candid in respect of this incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Mr Cordato sought to glean from counsel what had been overheard before he was prepared to give his own version of the toilet discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">To his credit, Mr Cordato told Mr Gulson that his suggested evidence was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">But this incident and Mr Cordato's response to its revelation in the witness box caused me to have considerable reservations about his reliability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The incident also showed that Mr Gulson was prepared to seek to influence Mr Cordato's evidence to bolster his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">55 The defendants argued that at the time of his dismissal Mr Reece never claimed the right to any deferred consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Mr Reece explained that he was distressed and did not raise any issue in relation to unpaid consultancy fees at the meeting with Mr Bax and Mr Gulson on 17 May 2002 where his services were terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">He said that he did not discuss anything at the meeting because he was so shocked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He never raised any claim for unpaid consultancy fees later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He had no funds and knew he would have had to pursue the matter, in effect, through lawyers whom he could not afford.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Moreover, while he was still a shareholder he knew that the group did not have funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He said he assumed that the group would eventually, when it became more affluent, make payments that had been due earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He then gave the following evidence:
 
 'You see, I suggest to you that you didn't raise it because you never believed those funds to be owing to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">---- You mean you are saying that I worked all that time for nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">
 
 I'm not saying that, Mr Reece, I'm suggesting to you that when the parties agreed not to charge consultancy fees, they agreed that they would cease to be paid?</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">--- They were suspended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">That was what happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Otherwise, I ... would never get any funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">' (T 403.32-.45)
 

56 Mr Bax said that in the meeting of 17 May 2002 he said to Mr Reece that if he signed over his shares in BGR his loan due to BGR would be forgiven and that the parties would all walk away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Mr Bax asserted that he said to Mr Reece that his also meant that there would be no claims for consultancy fees unpaid to Karcor and that Mr Reece agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Mr Gulson denies any mention was made of consultancy fees and he also relied on notes of the meeting taken by Ms Wee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Mr Bax had reservations about the completeness and accuracy of those notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Suffice to say that the notes conclude enigmatically with Mr Reece being recorded as having 'enquired about his value of shares' without any further notation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It is likely that there was discussion about this topic which Ms Wee's notes do not record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Given that Mr Reece was being removed and that he asked about the value of his shares, I am satisfied that Mr Bax referred to the assignment of the shares, the forgiveness of the loan to Karcor and to the parties all walking away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">57 However, I am not persuaded that any one specifically referred to consultancy fees which had not been invoiced since March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">It is likely, and I find, that Mr Reece thought he could still claim these but that, because of the 'walk away' proposal both Mr Bax and Mr Gulson understood that those consultancy fees were not to be claimed by Karcor or Mr Reece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that Mr Reece agreed to the 'walk away' proposal and thus lost any legal right for Karcor to claim consultancy fees: ( Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">58 Ultimately, Karcor's 74 shares were bought back by BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Its loan account was then about $290,000 in debit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Mr Reece signed the share transfer to BGR in November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Mr Reece said he believed the extinguishment of his loan account was a settlement for transfer of his shares and that consultancy fees were never mentioned, but his belief is irrelevant because of the agreement I have found was made in May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The buy back was effected formally in February 2004 and 74 replacement shares were allocated to the remaining BGR shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Karcor's loan account balance owed to BGR was extinguished by the remaining shareholders assuming responsibility for it in proportion to their shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">After this, Mr Bax, through Food Improvers, held a 24% interest BGR, Mr Gulson, through Triad a 68% interest and Mr Cordato through Cordato Partners Services, an 8% interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">59 The defendants argued that after the sale of one investment (Jabiru Table Grapes) in 2004, the group received cash funds and $695,000 was paid to the shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">That payment was made in approximately, but not exactly, the proportions of the shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">They argued that this indicated that when BGR had the capacity it did not use surplus cash to pay consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">However, no distribution was made as a dividend or as a payment of consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Instead, interest free loans were made through the BGR shareholders' loan accounts to the three shareholders in proportions not exactly matching their shareholding (Mr Bax's company receiving about 33% of the distribution).</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">60 None of the parties was able to give any explanation why the proportions used for those loans were out of alignment with the relevant shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">These loans following the sale of a capital asset do not support the defendants' contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">At best they are neutral facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">It would be likely that when capital assets were sold, the shareholders would receive a return of the capital in proportion to their shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The need to suspend the payment of monthly consultancy fees was caused because the group's income generating activities and cash flows did not support those payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">61 When the cash flows returned to a sufficient level reduced consultancy fees commenced to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The size of those payments increased as the cash flow situation improved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">From July 2003 consultancy fees (exclusive of GST) of $8,000 per month were paid to Mr Bax's and Mr Gulson's companies out of cash flows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">That was maintained until August 2004 when the amount increased to $10,000 a month and from December 2004 to $15,000 per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The parties appear to have distinguished between rewarding the two active partners, Mr Bax and Mr Gulson, for their work by using cash out of revenues and rewarding the shareholders by advancing interest free loans of surplus capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">62 The defendants argued that if Food Improvers and Karcor were able to invoice later for consultancy fees they would have engaged in a fraud on the minority by failing to record the liability in BGR's accounts and the accrued entitlement in their own accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">They made, but withdrew an assertion that it was also a fraud on the revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Mr Bax said Food Improvers accounted on a cash basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">That meant that it did not have to bring to account any fees not actually paid to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">And cl 4.1 of the consultancy agreement contemplated that the time for payment of the fee could be 'otherwise agreed between the parties', while cl 10.11 envisaged that a tax invoice would be issued to BGR monthly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Cordato Partners Services was not the victim of a fraud on the minority by any failure to accrue unpaid consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">63 I am of opinion that the parties agreed in March 2001 that BGR's liability for payment of the consultancy fees which would otherwise become due under cl 4.1 would be made subject to a condition that BGR be able to pay before the consultant were entitled to issue tax invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Thus, if BGR were never in a position to pay, it had no liability to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Similar arrangements are familiar to lawyers who agrees to a 'no win, no pay' contingency fee with clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Here, Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece agreed to risk their fees, and to make substantial loans, with Mr Cordato, in the hope that BGR would recover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">There was no fraud on the minority in not accruing any liability in BGR's accounts for consultancy fees which had not been invoiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Indeed, Mr Cordato never sought to correct the same accounts over the years before January 2006 to reflect his firm's unbilled work in progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">64 There was no consideration given by BGR for a release from its liability under the consultancy agreements to pay the monthly fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">For Food Improvers to give up the right to receive over $20,000 per month required, as a matter of contractual analysis, some form of consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The defendants never identified what the consideration was for each of the partners still to provide services at the level and rate that he had been given before this supposed agreement yet to abandon any right to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Their argument leads to a commercially absurd result and reflects convenient self interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">It is inconsistent with their conduct in and after the meeting with Mr Lombardo and the rendering by Mr Cordato, with Mr Gulson's agreement, in January 2006 of unbilled fees for over six years work when the proceeds of Main Camp were about to be received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">65 I am satisfied that in March 2001 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece did agree to defer the rendering of invoices for consultancy fees until the group could pay and they did not intend to or effectively give up their rights to invoice BGR at a later time for the work that had already been or was to be performed during the period when the group could not pay them at all or in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">I find that the partners agreed to pay interest on the funds borrowed by them which they on lent to BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">I am satisfied that Mr Gulson's account was not reliable because it is inconsistent with the contemporaneous accounting records of BGR and the evidence of Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">(Ex 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The payments made by Triad, Food Improvers and Karcor in March 2001 included substantial sums refunding consultancy fees which I also accept Mr Bax's and Mr Reece's evidence as to the meeting of March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">It follows that Food Improvers is entitled to invoice and claim those fees at the rate of $20,833.33 plus GST for the period in which they were not paid in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">THE MAY 2005 BUSINESS TRIP 
 
66 From early 2000, Mr Bax had increased his involvement in the sales and marketing efforts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">After Mr Reece left, Mr Gobert took over his position as the group sales manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Mr Gobert was an acknowledged world expert in tea-tree oil and its products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Mr Bax accompanied, and provided support for, Mr Gobert on his overseas visits to customers in the European Union and the United States of America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In contrast, Mr Bax had not travelled overseas with Mr Gulson since 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">67 In April 2005 Mr Gulson advised Mr Gobert that he was proposing to draw up a draft long term supply contract between the Main Camp group and an Israeli customer Biomor, for discussion at the proposed meetings with Biomor representatives and Main Camp's Israeli distributor, Schlomo Steinberg of Petrus Chemicals in London.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">68 On 17 May 2005 Mr Gobert met with Mr Bax and Mr Gulson at BGR's offices in Sydney to discuss the draft Biomor contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">During the meeting Mr Gulson broke the news that he was leaving for overseas the next day to go to Singapore and that he would arrive in Newcastle, England, on 23 May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Mr Gulson referred to a two page document which he had prepared saying that it was the 'contract' for the Biomor meeting in London.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Mr Gobert queried whether, after four weeks, the two pages were all that Mr Gulson had prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Mr Gulson said that Mr Cordato had let them down on the matter and that he had to prepare the document himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Mr Bax and Mr Gobert proposed several amendments to the draft and they prepared the next version of the heads of agreement and covering email to Biomor which was attached to Mr Bax's email to Mr Gulson of 17 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Mr Gulson asked for the email addresses of the Biomor executives and of Mr Steinberg so that he could have his wife send them the revised draft in advance of the London meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">69 Mr Gulson did not use computers, but his wife, who was a successful businesswoman, helped him with his email and other correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">She sent and received email and correspondence for Mr Gulson, even when he was overseas and she remained in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">When one of BGR's staff, Ms Bevan, provided to Mr Gulson her handwritten transcription of the email addresses for the Israeli recipients she made a number of errors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The consequence was that when Mrs Gulson sent the emails, none of the intended Israeli recipients received them and, as events happened, they arrived in London without any knowledge of what was in the draft heads of agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">70 When they met in Newcastle, England, on 22 May 2005 Mr Gobert mentioned to Mr Bax that he had received an email about the Biomor draft from Mrs Gulson before he left Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">He told Mr Bax that it was almost the same as what they had advised Mr Gulson except for a few changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr Bax was happy that they had something.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Mr Gobert had a new laptop computer with him but he was unable, because of some technical problem, to receive any email while in Europe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Mr Gobert had printed in Sydney a copy of Mr Gulson's email and he had put it in his luggage, but the luggage had been lost in transit and was only delivered two days later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">By that time, Mr Gobert and Mr Bax appear to have forgotten about that email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Mr Bax did not see it until 31 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">71 In late May 2005, Mr Gobert had a meeting in Brussels with a regulatory body (the Scientific Committee for Cosmetic Products) comprised of a group of experts who reviewed the toxicology of raw materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">They met to discuss a proposed European Commission regulation of tea tree oil products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Representatives of two of Main Camp's largest customers, Christopher Dean, of TP Health, and Ken Shephard, the senior counsel of the American company, Melaleuca Inc, also participated in the SCCP meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Next, Mr Gobert was to address a major industry meeting in London about tea tree oil's status under the proposed regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">There were also planned discussions with major customers in the United Kingdom and then in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">MR LAWSON'S EXPERIENCE OF MR GULSON 
 
72 Mr Lawson, was the Managing Director of Unifect Limited, Main Camp group's distributor in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">He gave evidence about a number of instances of inappropriate and odd behaviour which Mr Gulson exhibited during the time which they spent together in the days leading up to 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">During a meeting on 26 May with Mr Bax, Mr Gulson, Mr Lawson, together with Unifect's sales manager, Ms Marsh, at the headquarters of a large potential customer for tea-tree oil, Mr Gulson appeared to be anxious to get away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Whilst Ms Marsh was in the middle of her presentation, Mr Gulson stood up and, without any prior warning, brought the meeting to an end, to Mr Lawson's and Ms Marsh's puzzlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">73 Mr Lawson described obsessional behaviour of Mr Gulson's after he saw some non-safety matches in a pub.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">This led to Mr Gulson trying to get out of a moving car in heavy Friday afternoon traffic and crossing a divided road looking for a supermarket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Mr Lawson gave a number of other instances of Mr Gulson's inappropriate comments and behaviour around his family, including making loud, insulting and racially biased comments at a restaurant in respect of a woman dressed in traditional Muslim dress and others of non-Caucasian appearance who passed by saying 'They look like terrorists to me .. they're definitely terrorists'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">He began smoking a large Havana cigar in the non-smoking restaurant and refused to put it out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">He told stories relating to his use of illegal drugs and his being supposedly 'banged up for a while in South America with Ronnie Biggs' (the notorious Great Train Robber).</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">74 On a later occasion, in the Lawson's kitchen, Mr Gulson asked their 16 year old daughter 'do you know what 'wank' means?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">' Mr Gulson was oblivious to the embarrassment his comments and behaviour were causing to Mr Lawson's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Taken in isolation, each incident Mr Lawson described could perhaps be viewed by some persons as a momentary lapse, social clumsiness or the effects of too many drinks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">But, Mr Gulson seemed to Mr Lawson, as he wrote to Mr Bax on 3 June 2005 '... to be unbalanced and totally out of control'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">75 In cross-examination there was little challenge to Mr Lawson's factual description of Mr Gulson's behaviour, although it was sought to suggest that he was biased because of his conduct in sending an email 'wanted' poster of Mr Gulson in insulting language and subsequently going into business with Mr Bax and Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The email showed that Mr Lawson was himself capable of inappropriate behaviour in response to Mr Gulson's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">I am satisfied however, that Mr Lawson gave a reliable account of Mr Gulson's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">No doubt he found Mr Gulson on the occasion of his English visit to be socially very difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">This behaviour was symptomatic of his then unknown psychiatric disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Mr Lawson appears to have been provoked to later react but not to give inaccurate evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Nor did his the subsequent business relationship with Mr Bax and Mr Gobert affect the reliability of Mr Lawson's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">I formed the view that Mr Lawson was an honest witness and I have no reason to doubt his account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">EVENTS OF 29 MAY 2005 
 
76 On the morning of 29 May Messrs Bax, Gulson and Gobert visited a National Trust House.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">They then went at Mr Gulson's request to Cowdray Park, so that he could look at polo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Mr Gulson watched a polo match alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">While waiting outside the polo game, Mr Gobert updated his presentation slides based on what had happened at the meetings he had attended on the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">He did not work specifically on the Biomor presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Mr Bax made a number of attempts to persuade Mr Gulson to return to the car so they could get to the Renaissance Hotel at Heathrow near London where they were to stay and hold the Biomor meetings but Mr Gulson insisted on watching the whole game, which concluded at about 5pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">77 In the car on the way to the Renaissance Hotel there was a discussion in which Mr Gobert said that he was concerned about some of the points that Mr Gulson had left in the email to Biomor with the draft heads of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">There was a discussion about Mr Gulson's proposal which concluded with Mr Gulson stating that he had taken an executive decision and was not going to change the draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">They arrived at the hotel at about 6-6.15pm Mr Gulson came to Mr Gobert's room at about 6.30pm just after the latter had finished returning the hire car and suggested they have a drink before dinner but Mr Gobert was unavailable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">78 Shortly after, Mr Bax and Mr Gulson met in the foyer of the hotel with Biomor's Peter Tirosh, his son Ziv Tirosh, Danny Neifeld and Zvi Paster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Mr Gobert joined them a little later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">All were chatting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Mr Gulson enquired whether the Biomor representatives had received the documents he had sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">They said that they had not received anything from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Mr Gulson stood up and said that they had been sent several days before but they reiterated that nothing had been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Mr Gulson, who was by then a little agitated, said he would go to his room and ring his wife, and left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Mr Gobert, at the time, did not think about the fact that he had a copy in his luggage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">79 The others left to go to a nearby restaurant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">About 10 or 15 minutes later Mr Steinberg arrived at the restaurant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Gulson joined the table soon after saying that his wife was faxing the documents to the hotel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">During dinner Mr Gulson drank some wine and several glasses of grappa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">After dinner, the whole party returned to the hotel foyer except for Mr Gulson who began speaking to a table of young women in the restaurant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">He rejoined the others in the foyer a short while later with photocopies, made by the hotel, of the two page draft heads of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The Israelis each said that they had never seen the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Mr Gulson said that the covering email or header was missing and that he would ring his wife to fax it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">He made a telephone call and a little while later distributed copies of the covering email which his wife had sent on 20 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Mr Neifeld said that the reason he had not received the email was because his email address was not there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Mr Steinberg said that his company's name in the email address was spelt incorrectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Peter Tirosh said that his email address was also incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">80 Mr Gulson became very angry and shouted: 'Are you calling me incompetent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">' at all present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">At the time there were quite a lot of people present in the lobby unconnected with the BGR and Biomor representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Mr Neifeld said: 'No: it is just a little mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Don't worry'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Mr Gulson then turned on Mr Gobert saying: 'It's all your fault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Your staff have given me the wrong addresses --- they are incompetent and you are managing them poorly'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">Mr Gobert, understandably, was quite embarrassed by this abuse in front of the customers and other people in the lobby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">MR GOBERT AND MR GULSON MOVE AWAY 
 
81 Mr Gulson claimed that he then took Mr Gobert aside and told him that his wife had been trying to email Mr Gobert and the office for days about the emails to the Israelis which had not been able to be delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Mr Gulson blamed Mr Gobert for not getting the correct email addresses for the Israelis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In cross-examination, Mr Gobert denied both that he had any knowledge that Mrs Gulson had made such attempts and that Mr Gulson had raised this topic with him on the evening of 29 May.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">I accept Mr Gobert's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">As Mr Gobert said when confronted with Mr Gulson's account, if Mrs Gulson had a problem she could have easily told her husband rather than continuing to get no response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Notably, Mrs Gulson, though available, was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">I infer that her evidence would not have assisted the defendants' case ( Jones v Dunkel (1959 ) [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298).</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">82 In evidence, Mr Gulson asserted that he had been unable to communicate with his wife by telephone while he was in Southdown, England before arriving at Heathrow, 'because there wasn't that facility'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">I do not accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">His itinerary had telephone and fax numbers for the Southdown hotel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Even if a landline phone was not available (which I am not satisfied was the case), he had his mobile phone with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Mr Gulson asserted that he did not use his mobile phone except in emergencies, and it was off most of the time (coincidentally, his mobile phone rang while he was in the witness box).</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">He could have contacted his wife by telephone, or she him, at any time during the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">He also acknowledged that he probably spoke to his wife when he first arrived in Newcastle, England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Of course, by then the email problem had emerged so Ms Gulson could have raised it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Moreover, Mr Gulson had no difficulty telephoning his wife twice earlier on the night of 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">83 Although in Mr Gulson's account he said that Mr Gobert had told him in the conversation that Christopher Dean had offered Mr Gobert a job, Mr Gobert denied this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Mr Gulson said that he told Mr Gobert that he had not been really performing in terms of sale prices and suggested that he take the job with Mr Dean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">He accused Mr Gobert of raising for the third time in the past year that he had been offered the job and asked what was going on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">He said that Mr Gobert had responded that he was merely letting him know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Mr Gulson continued his account:
 
 'Mr Gulson: The timing is appalling, how can you continue with this trip if your heart is not in it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">I think that in all conscience, you should leave the rest of the trip to John and myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">
 
 Mr Gobert: If that is your attitude, I am resigning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">' 
 

84 I do not believe Mr Gulson's account of this conversation, which he first offered in his affidavit of 16 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">It is designed to improve his own case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Soon after these events on the evening of 29 May he phoned each of Mr Cordato and Mr Williams and said he had sacked Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Mr Gulson also told Mr McGilvray on the next day that he had sacked Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">When he was in the Caritas Centre on 4 July 2005 he told the doctors that he recently had to sack employees who were undermining him in front of others and this was a spontaneous decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">None of these conversations referred to Mr Gobert resigning or suggested anything other than his sacking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">85 During cross-examination Mr Gulson gave this evidence:
 
 'Why would he resign after you sacked him?</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">--- Well, I mean there's [an] issue there of constructive dismissal isn't there [?</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">] So maybe he didn't take it as that and it only occurred to me after I had --- did the affidavits, I thought this could be constructive dismissal, but anyway, be that as it may, it's there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">And, you know, that's what happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">I'm sorry, I can't change my words, the words were what I recalled when I did the affidavit, but I pondered about it later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">' 
 

86 His evidence continued by suggesting that Mr Gulson had drawn a line as a result of Mr Gobert's alleged reference to the job offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Although Mr Gulson denied that he was out of control during the conversation, his denial was in these terms:
 
 'No, I wasn't, totally --- .</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">' 
 

I find that Mr Gulson was irrational and out of control and that he is not able accurately to recall what in fact had happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Yet, when he gave his evidence he sought to attribute fault to Mr Gobert, in the sense of the latter resigning during the trip, so as to justify his own position in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">He asserted that his grounds for acting as he did on the evening of 29 May 2005 with Mr Gobert were:
 
 'But ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">I didn't want somebody on board who you have to constantly got to wonder, "What's he going to do in three months time?</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">What's he going to do in four months time or nine months time?</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">" 
 Despite the fact the he had given you no indication that he was even contemplating?</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">--- Look, you can draw the lines, you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">I'm not silly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">You don't keep on raising that issue if it's not live 
 ...I mean, you know, there comes a time when you say "Well go.".</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">' 

87 At another point in his cross-examination Mr Gulson had agreed that when he claimed to have used the words 'I think that in all conscience you should leave the rest of the trip to John and myself' during the meeting with Mr Gobert, he was in fact telling him to go home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">He was asked:
 
 'You were telling him he was sacked?</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">
 
 There was no doubt in your mind after you had this conversation with Jim Gobert at the Renaissance Hotel on the evening of 29 May 2005 that you had sacked him?</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">And I think elsewhere in my affidavit I said so --- said so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">
 
 Well I'm asking you, Mr Gulson, not what's in the rest of your affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">I am asking you in the witness box, you had no doubt after that conversation with Jim Gobert that you had sacked him?</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">--- Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">
 
 That you had sacked him without any consultation with your fellow director John Bax?</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">--- At that time correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">' 
 

88 I do not accept Mr Gulson's accounts of Mr Gobert's sacking or of what occurred between them when they were alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Rather I accept Mr Gobert's evidence that when Mr Gulson sought to take Mr Gobert away to the side to a bar, along the way, in front of a large number of people in the foyer, Mr Gulson, who was red faced and making threatening gestures with his hands, started shouting at Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Mr Gulson addressed a number of insulting profanities to Mr Gobert in the course of the conversation accusing him of having a bad attitude and undermining Mr Gulson's authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Mr Gobert responded that Mr Gulson was behaving on the trip like a spoilt child and should grow up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">He reminded Mr Gulson that if it were not for him, they would not be having the opportunity with Biomor (it being a customer which Mr Gobert had cultivated).</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Mr Gulson continued his profane diatribe saying that, in effect, it was his company and he would do whatever he wanted to do with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Mr Gobert broke away saying that he was not wasting his time talking to Mr Gulson when he was behaving in that way and that he would join the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">It was only later, as I set out below, that Mr Gobert was sacked by Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">MR BAX FALLS OUT WITH MR GULSON WHEN HE SACKS MR GOBERT 
 
89 After Mr Gobert walked away from Mr Gulson, he went back and sat down with Mr Bax and Mr Steinberg in a different section of the lobby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Mr Gulson joined them shortly afterwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">In Mr Gulson's account he 'stormed off back to the part of the foyer' where the others were sitting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">90 In the foyer Mr Gulson said to Mr Gobert that he was incompetent and irresponsible and was undermining the integrity of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">Mr Gobert asked why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Mr Gulson said that he and Mr Bax were a couple of clowns and they had contributed nothing to the Biomor meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Mr Bax retorted that the Biomor documents (which Mr Gulson had distributed that evening) were basically what he and Mr Gobert had drafted before leaving Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Mr Gulson said Mr Bax should not speak to him like that and that it was his (expletive) company and that he would do whatever he liked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Mr Gobert said that Mr Gulson should stop being so immature and grow up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">He said that Mr Dean said he was very impressed with the work that Mr Gobert had done (in response to the accusation of incompetence) and would like to work closer with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">He asked whether Mr Gulson would like him (Mr Gobert) to pursue that further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Mr Gulson said that he would warn Mr Dean to stop being so unprofessional to be poaching his staff and that Mr Gobert was totally unprofessional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">He then told Mr Gobert that he was dismissed and he should get out now and have nothing further to do with the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Mr Bax and Mr Steinberg were speechless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">91 During this encounter Mr Gulson was red faced, shouting, using obscenities and making threatening gestures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Mr Gobert and Mr Bax were concerned Mr Gulson might assault Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Mr Gobert then got up, walked out, sat on a garden wall outside and then called his wife in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">92 Mr Bax then said to Mr Gulson:
 
 'I just can't believe what you've done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">You've destroyed six years of hard work with your foul mouth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">I just can't work with you any more Fred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Our partnership is over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">' 

Mr Bax then went out and joined Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">After a while, they went back inside and Mr Bax noticed Mr Gulson and Mr Steinberg were in the bar area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Mr Gulson was sitting back having a scotch and smoking a cigar with his feet up on the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Mr Steinberg was also having a scotch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Mr Steinberg approached them and Mr Gulson got up and started to walk towards them as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Mr Gobert, noticing this, said that he was going to his room and left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Mr Steinberg suggested that they all have a drink but Mr Bax declined a drink.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Mr Bax repeated that he could not believe what Mr Gulson had just done, that Mr Gobert was the technical expert of the company and Mr Gulson had just dismissed him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Mr Bax enquired as to the point of going on with the trip when everything they were going to talk about was technical, requiring Mr Gobert's services and there was no-one who could fill in for Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Mr Steinberg indicated that he was going to catch a train to central London and hoped that the two could sort things out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">He left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">93 Mr Gulson then said: 'Well that went well' and smirked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Mr Bax retorted:
 
 
 'You've just dismissed Jim Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">How do you think we're going to keep our customers without Jim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Jim is the lynchpin between Main Camp and all our customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">He's the one who expanded our customer base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">People rely on [him] for technical expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">He's always talking to them, meeting them and is considered, I think probably, a world expert in tea tree oil because ... of what he was doing with the SCCP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Look, we're no better than any other tea tree producer now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">We haven't got any technical expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">All we're doing is selling oils.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Biomor can get oil from anywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">They don't have to get it from us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">But what they wanted us for is to assist them with their regulatory processes they had to go through in the EU and Jim Gobert's technical knowledge because he is helping them with their local consultant in Australia as well, for getting registration in Australia for their products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">All we're going to do now is compete on price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">We've got nothing else to differentiate ourselves from other players.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">We had all the expertise and now its gone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">' 
 

Mr Bax also remonstrated with Mr Gulson for using the abusive language and said that he was appalled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">He got up and returned to his room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">94 I am satisfied from the contemporaneous material, including Mr Gobert's subsequent handwritten letters which he sent from overseas to Australia, and his and Mr Bax's accounts of the same events on the night of 29 May 2005 that Mr Gulson was in an irrational and uncontrolled rage, which was due to his rapidly deteriorating mental condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">I am also satisfied that Mr Gulson, despite the rage, was conscious that he had sacked Mr Gobert on the spot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">His ultimate concession, during cross-examination, that there had to come a time when one could say 'Well, go' demonstrated this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">It suited Mr Gulson's case to assert that Mr Gobert withdrew from the trip at that time by resigning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">I do not believe Mr Gulson was telling me the truth in his asserted account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">After all, it was his evidence that Mr Gobert '... was the lynchpin for the Israeli meetings'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Having had the benefit of seeing and hearing him in the witness box and assessing his evidence against independent material, as well as that of Mr Bax and Mr Gobert, I prefer the evidence of the latter two wherever there is a conflict with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">95 Mr Gobert had nothing to do with his own cessation of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">There was no legal basis for the dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">And, it is notable that this critical decision was taken unilaterally, by Mr Gulson, without any consultation with his partner, Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">EVENTS LATER ON 29 AND 30 MAY 2005 
 
96 Mr Gobert spoke to Mr Cordato later that night from London (Sydney next morning) saying the trip had gone very badly, Mr Gulson had sacked him a few hours before and he was told not to have anything further to do with the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">He said he could not attend the Biomor or other meetings and that Mr Gulson was shouting at him in the lobby and calling him by profanities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">He said that he had never been publicly abused like that and that there were no grounds for sacking him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Mr Cordato said that Mr Gulson had already called him and that he had not said anything about the incident but was very odd and sounded guilty about something.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Mr Gobert said that he had sent a fax to his assistant, Ms Bevan, and asked her to send a copy to Mr Cordato.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">He was going to arrange to return as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">97 Mr Bax sent an email to Mr Cordato stating that there was no further relationship between himself and Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">He said that in his opinion Mr Gulson had become extremely irresponsible and uncontrollable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">He set out an account of the previous evening's events, noted that Mr Gulson had told them that he could run the business by himself, which was exactly what would occur as no-one would work for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">He said that he could not see how the situation was recoverable and that Mr Gobert and he were returning home on the next available flight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Mr Cordato responded by email saying that unfortunately if the directors were divided, the enterprise had to be sold while it had enterprise value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">He noted that it would obviously be beneficial, and probably vital, if both Mr Bax and Mr Gobert remained pending the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">That sale had to be the whole of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">98 The next morning, Mr Bax also telephoned Mr Cordato and told him that he and Mr Gulson had had a major confrontation the previous evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">He said that Mr Gulson had been abusive to Mr Gobert and that he (Mr Bax) had said that their relationship or partnership was now over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Mr Cordato said that he had already received telephone calls from both Mr Gobert and Mr Gulson and knew what he was talking about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">He said that he had sent an email to Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">99 The next morning in London, Mr Steinberg joined Mr Bax and Mr Gobert in the latter's room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Mr Gobert told them not to discuss anything commercially sensitive in front of him because his employment had been terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">100 Mr Williams, the Main Camp plantation manager, received two telephone calls from Mr Gulson on 30 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">He said that Mr Gulson was mumbling and very incoherent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">In the first call Mr Gulson told him that he had sacked Mr Bax and Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">He asked Mr Gulson what he was talking about but could not get any sensible or comprehensible response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">About 4 hours later Mr Gulson rang him back again mumbling and speaking incoherently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">He told Mr Williams he was in a taxi cab in the early hours of the morning in London.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Mr Gulson sounded to him to be either drunk or mentally unwell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">At various parts of this conversation Mr Gulson told him that Mr Bax and Mr Gobert had misled him and that he had just sacked them both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">He said that he would be the new managing director and would send a fax to Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">He said that he would be closing the Sydney office and moving everyone up to the farm which would save him a lot of money and the money would all come to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">101 From Mr Williams's oral evidence it became clear that he was confused as to dates and had a tendency to telescope different occasions or conversations into one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">Mr Williams struck me as an honest witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">He obviously did not like Mr Gulson and felt very strongly about his behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">However, I am satisfied that the substance of his evidence as to his experience and observation of Mr Gulson's behaviour and conversations in late May and June 2005 is reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">102 Later, on 30 or 31 May 2005, Mr Gulson telephoned Bill McGilvray who was fast asleep in Australia at about 2 or 3 am Australian time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">The two had known each other for a number of years and Mr McGilvray had his own business of buying and selling, among other oils, tea tree oil and which he operated from near the Main Camp plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Mr Gulson was difficult to follow and gave no explanation for calling Mr McGilvray at that hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Mr Gulson said he had just done a big deal for a lot of tea tree oil and that he had some issues with Mr Gobert about not, somehow, following the deal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">He told Mr McGilvray that he had sacked Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">He had never rung Mr McGilvray before this to tell him of deals he had done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">103 On 30 May Mr Gobert sent a number of faxes to Mr Cordato.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">He noted that he wanted to have some written reasons as to why he had been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">He wanted Mr Gulson to cease defaming him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">He also wrote on 30 May to Ms Bevan asking her to contact all customers telling them that unfortunately he would not be able to meet them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">He asked her to liaise with Mr Gulson and customers as to which customers Mr Gulson would meet for the rest of the trip and to do so urgently so that the business was not disadvantaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">He referred to the fact that he could not get emails on the trip and asked that he not be sent any company related information directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">104 On the next day, Mr Gobert faxed Mr Cordato saying that despite the nature of his employment termination, he would have been willing to show Mr Gulson the presentations for the major customers that he had not previously seen, but that Mr Gulson had made no attempt to contact him prior to his departure for Australia even though they were in adjoining rooms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">He noted that there were some key issues that needed to be addressed, which had been previously been discussed with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">He went through each of the major customers and issues that appeared to be important to advance the BGR group's interests in discussions with them so that Mr Gulson, if he used the material, would have the assistance of Mr Gobert's insights into what should happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">In that fax he disclosed that he had received an employment offer from a Main Camp customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">In cross-examination he acknowledged that this was Mr Neifeld of Biomor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">He again complained about Mr Gulson's behaviour and defamatory comments about him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">He reminded Mr Cordato that Mr Gulson would need to be aware of a deadline for a submission to TP Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">105 Also on 31 May Mr Gobert sent another fax to Mr Cordato indicating that his place on the technical and safety committee was vacant and asked whether Mr Gulson wanted to fill the vacancy himself or let the decision be made by the Australian Tea Tree Industry Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">He said that he took this view because the BGR group had paid for his attendance at Brussels and did not think that he would be paid for attending the further meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">He again pointed to the urgent commercial issues that faced the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">106 Mr Gobert's actions were those of a professional and concerned employee and appeared to me to be genuinely felt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">He seems to have been torn between his loyalty for the Main Camp business and his reaction to the abusive behaviour to which he had been subjected by Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">In his letter of 15 June 2005 Mr Gulson said that Mr Gobert had been 'bagging' the company, its staff and certain senior executives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">No particulars were given of this allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Mr Gobert said that Mr Gulson made up these allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">I prefer his evidence to Mr Gulson's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">107 In final address the defendants accepted that Mr Gulson had constructively dismissed Mr Gobert in the Renaissance Hotel foyer on 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">It was more than a constructive dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Mr Gobert was sacked summarily and without justification by Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">I am of opinion that Mr Gulson was mentally unwell at the time and that his condition subsequently deteriorated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">However by 29 May 2005 he was having periods of considerable irrationality in which he was very forceful and aggressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Earlier he had exhibited peculiar behaviour when with Mr Lawson and his family and on the afternoon of 29 May 2005, his insistence on going to and remaining at a polo game without attempting to assist Mr Bax or Mr Gobert to prepare for the dinner meeting with the Biomor representatives was odd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Mr Gulson's reactions to the failure of his wife's emails to reach the Israeli gentlemen was also quite odd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">108 I am of opinion that the reason Mr Gobert went on the overseas trip with Mr Gulson and Mr Bax was because Mr Gobert was viewed by both of them as being an essential participant in the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">Had Mr Gulson had any substantive reservation about Mr Gobert's performance such as would warrant him being terminated, for example, his proffered excuse that Mr Gobert was not negotiating sales of bulk tea tree oil at high enough prices, he would not have been taken on the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">The effort, time and expenditure for the trip was substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Mr Gulson would have considered that he had placed at risk the commercial reputation of the Main Camp business internationally, had he had reservations about Mr Gobert before the trip, at a time when the group was still experiencing cash flow difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Mr Gulson's behaviour was extraordinary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">It involved abusing Mr Gobert publicly in the hotel foyer and summarily dismissing him, allegedly because Mr Gobert said that he had been offered another job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">I do not believe Mr Gulson's evidence on this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">109 In final submissions the defendants argued that Mr Gulson's summary dismissal of Mr Gobert was justified because he did not accept responsibility for Ms Bevan's mistranscription of the Israeli email addresses, his lack of commitment and because he had not achieved higher prices for Main Camp's tea tree oil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">No attempt was made to address the termination provisions of Mr Gobert's employment agreement (2/481) to demonstrate how any of this alleged conduct could warrant summary dismissal in London on 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">There, cl 8.1 entitled his employer, SNP Natural Products Pty Ltd, to terminate the agreement immediately if he:
 
&#8226; committed any material breach of the agreement or any act of serious and wilful misconduct (cl 8.1(a) and (b));
 
&#8226; he had conducted himself in a manner which in SNP's reasonable opinion, would detrimentally effect its business (cl 8.1(i)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">110 The email address mix up was not the fault of Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">He was highly committed to the group's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">If a failure to achieve higher prices were a genuine concern of Mr Gulson's, Mr Gobert would not have been taken on the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">He did nothing on the trip to affect adversely prices and thus could not have been summarily dismissed when and as he was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Indeed, if this ground had any basis, the decision to take Mr Gobert on the trip and have him participate in all the planned meetings waived the 'right' to rely on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">The defendants' argument for his dismissal is specious and without any substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">111 The defendants also argued that Mr Bax had lost any legitimate expectation to be involved in BGR's management after Mr Gobert's dismissal because he said he could no longer work with Mr Gulson, and he refused Mr Gulson's offer to discuss things after the dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">They said an objective bystander would realise 'blow ups' were common and he could not refuse to discuss matters or continue with the trip or allege 'unfair prejudice' to his minority position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">And, they argued '[o]verhearing a few profanities does not alter this position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">' Moreover they argued that Mr Bax should have discussed matters with Mr Gulson and was wrong not to have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">112 This overlooks the fact that Mr Gulson persisted in his resolve to dismiss Mr Gobert and continue on the trip without him even though his expertise was needed and the customers were expecting him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Mr Gulson never resiled from that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">He never apologised for his objectively inappropriate behaviour towards Mr Gobert and Mr Bax and his exclusion of Mr Bax from the 'decision' to dismiss Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Nor would a reasonable person consider that Mr Gulson was offering to consult with Mr Bax or seek or respect his views as to the further conduct of the overseas trip, meetings with customers or the management of BGR or the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">Mr Bax had been presented with a fait accompli.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Mr Gulson appeared to require him to accept the radical change he had wrought and to proceed with the trip accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">This betrayed a detachment from reality symptomatic of Mr Gulson's mental condition in mid 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">The submission is equally unreal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">113 After sacking Mr Gobert in front of Mr Steinberg and Mr Bax, Mr Gulson smirkingly said to Mr Bax 'well, that went well'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">Mr Bax's reaction to such inappropriate conduct by Mr Gulson was quite understandable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Mr Gulson's behaviour over the previous few days obviously had had some impact on Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">In the middle of an overseas trip Mr Gulson had sacked an executive whom he knew was a key person not only in the business but also on the trip, without even consulting Mr Bax in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">This action demonstrated that the partnership at that time was not workable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Mr Gulson had arrogated to himself the running of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">He had taken a significant decision without involving his fellow director with whom he was travelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">The decision whether to dismiss Mr Gobert in any event, let alone in the middle of the trip when both Mr Bax and Mr Gulson were there, could not have been, in light of the history of their relationship, the prerogative of one of them alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">114 It is unsurprising that Mr Bax regarded the partnership as over at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">By his conduct, Mr Gulson had shown this to Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">While Mr Gulson in his evidence asserted that he had complained that Mr Bax had not given him the opportunity of hearing his reasons for dismissing Mr Gobert, I think that Mr Bax was honest and reasonable in saying that he could not work with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">Mr Bax's reaction was one a reasonable businessman in the position of quasi partnership the two men then had is likely to have had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">Mr Gulson had taken a decision vital to the future of the group in an irrational rage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">The conduct was very public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">It followed earlier, erratic and inappropriate behaviour by Mr Gulson in Mr Bax's presence, including the incidents described by Mr Lawson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">It was also undermining of Mr Bax's authority in front of Mr Gobert and Mr Steinberg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">It was followed by Mr Gulson asserting that what he had done 'went well' when he had created a commercial crisis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">115 The defendants criticised Mr Bax for failing to attend the meetings with Biomor on the next day during which Mr Gulson negotiated a new contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">They said he ignored his obligations as a senior executive and partner in the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">However, Mr Bax could not be expected to continue as if nothing had happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Mr Gobert's technical expertise was not going to be available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">Mr Gulson was liable to behave in the increasingly irrational way which he had exhibited over the preceding days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">By accompanying Mr Gulson, Mr Bax could be perceived as associating himself with the former's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Moreover, Mr Bax could justifiably feel a sense of betrayal of trust by Mr Gulson in the way in which he had treated not just Mr Gobert but himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">RETURN TO AUSTRALIA 
 
116 When Mr Bax, Mr Gobert and Mr Gulson returned to Australia, Mr Gulson's behaviour became worse as his mental condition deteriorated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">117 Mr Bax, Mr Cordato and Mr Gobert met on the morning of 6 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Mr Cordato said that Mr Gobert was a vital part of the BGR group and should remain a part of it in order to preserve value for the enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">Following this meeting Mr Bax signed a variation of Mr Gobert's employment contract increasing his notice period from 3 to 24 months' to ensure he had an incentive to stay and to establish the business after the events of 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Mr Bax saw this as giving Mr Gobert security in his position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Mr Bax did not discuss the new notice period with Mr Cordato or Mr Gulson because he thought it was within his powers as managing director to write it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">Mr Gobert agreed to the new provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">118 In early June Mrs Gulson rang Mr Williams and told him that her husband was on his way home from England and was coming straight up to the plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">She said he would explain what had happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">On his return Mr Gulson went straight to the plantation on 7 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">Mr Williams showed Mr Gulson his fax to Mr Bax of 7 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Mr Gulson reacted by going into a rage and began ranting incoherently, evincing his unhappiness about the sending of the fax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">119 On 7 or 8 June 2005 Mr Bax and Mr Cordato had a discussion in which Mr Bax informed Mr Cordato that two substantial payments had been received from customers totalling about $700,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">Mr Bax said that he wanted to pay all creditors that were due for payment at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">He said that given Mr Gulson's current state of mind he did not want large amounts of cash in the bank accounts when Mr Gulson returned as he, Mr Bax, was concerned that the cash might be diverted to Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">Mr Cordato responded that that was a good idea and that the leases should be paid three months in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Mr Bax replied that that was not possible as the leases were paid on a monthly cycle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">120 There then was a minor controversy between Mr Cordato and Mr Bax as to what Mr Cordato said about having his own accounts paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Mr Bax's account was that Mr Cordato said that he would bring all his accounts up to date with BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">He then invited Mr Bax to come with him to see Ms Fleming, the book keeper of Cordato Partners, who could print off all unbilled accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">Mr Cordato said that the conversation related to printing out copies of his firm's outstanding accounts or tax invoices, as opposed to any unbilled accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">According to Mr Bax he and Mr Cordato went to Ms Fleming's office and Mr Cordato asked her to print off all unbilled amounts due from the BGR Group and give them to Mr Bax who would arrange for them to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Mr Cordato and Ms Fleming said that Mr Cordato asked for the outstanding bills to be printed off and provided to Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">In any event Cordato Partners' outstanding bills, as opposed to their unbilled work in progress, were provided to Mr Bax and he arranged for their payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">121 I am satisfied that Mr Cordato and Ms Fleming understood that in the discussion Mr Bax requested the invoices which had already been rendered by Cordato Partners to the BGR companies, but had not then been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">However, Mr Bax thought he was asking for all of Cordato Partners' unbilled work in progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">I think that the differences in recollection are due to the participants in these conversations being at cross purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Mr Bax may have been seeking to have all the unrendered accounts provided, whereas Mr Cordato and Ms Fleming understood him to be asking for the accounts that had already been rendered but had not been paid to be printed off again so that payment could be arranged immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">I do not think that anything in substance turns on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">No doubt Mr Bax was later concerned in light of his understanding of what had transpired in January 2006 that Cordato Partners had rendered 16 invoices and received payment of nearly $135,000 more than what he had arranged to be paid in June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">122 Early in the morning on 8 June 2005 Mr Williams sent Mr Bax a further fax which said that Mr Gulson had totally lost his senses and was not rational in what he was saying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Mr Williams wrote that he felt Mr Gulson was on a path to destroy the Main Camp business, and 'was destroying the credibility of (sic) all staff within the business'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">Mr Williams expressed concern that Mr Gulson's behaviour was affecting how the Main Cap business was perceived in the local community and throughout the world through its business partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">He continued:
 
 'If Fred continues on this uncontrolled ego trip he is going to bring down Main Camp through banking credibility and possible foreclosure of the overdraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">' 
 

123 Mr Bax, Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson met on 8 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">Mr Bax emphasised that he could not work with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">That is hardly surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Mr Bax had then received Mr Williams' two faxes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">Mr Cordato summarized the result of the meeting on 8 June 2005 in an email to both Mr Gulson and Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">First, he noted that Mr Gulson would be reviewing Mr Gobert's contract, taking legal advice on it and referring back if he wished to take action on the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Secondly, Mr Cordato noted that there would be no organizational changes in terms of personnel, duties or work places, other than in respect of Mr Gobert for the time being.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">And, Mr Cordato said in evidence that at the end of the meeting they all agreed that Food Improvers' consultancy agreement for the provision of Mr Bax's services would continue in place and Mr Bax's functions and responsibilities would be the same as in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">I am satisfied that this was all agreed at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">124 However, at 23:57 on the evening of 9 June 2005 Mr Gulson sent a fax to Mr Cordato, Mr Bax, Mr Williams, BGR's accountant (Ms Mirjana Bojanovic) and Ms Wee, a former employee of the group, who was then in Singapore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">The fax was dated the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">It referred to the fruitful discussion that had been held on Wednesday (8 June) concerning the transition of management control within the BGR group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">It recorded that Mr Bax would continue to hold the appellation of managing director subject to the terms of his consultancy agreement and Mr Gulson would take the appellation of chairman and executive director in preparation for the earliest succession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">It noted that Mr Bax had agreed, as had he, that they would put the group's best interests first and that it was unlikely in his view that the problems which arose on the day of the negotiations of the Biomor contract would occur again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">The fax then referred to Mr Bax being asked to provide and, required Mr Gobert to provide, identification of all contacts they had had with persons in a business relationship with the group in the previous week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">Mr Gulson referred to an email which had been circulated by Mr Lawson and others showing Mr Gulson as the subject of a 'wanted' poster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">(Mr Gulson was understandably quite upset by this unflattering portrayal albeit he did not have any insight into his own role in causing Mr Lawson to indulge in this insulting and undignified behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">) Mr Gulson's fax continued by stating that the recipients should reassure customers and others '... that it is business as usual at Main Camp and that the only thing that has happened is that [Mr Bax's] ceasing of involvement is occurring on a faster timetable than he had indicated to us all over the last twelve months'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">125 In the context of the events in which it was written, the fax has an air of unreality, being in places emollient and in others provocative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">It was composed and sent without any involvement of Mr Bax or Mr Cordato.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">The fax conveys the impression that Mr Gulson, who signed it as chairman and executive director, was entitled to make Mr Bax answer to his directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">Mr Gulson had no such authority over Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">MR GULSON USES HIS CONTROLLING INTEREST TO REMOVE MR BAX 
 
126 Later on 10 June 2005 Mr Gulson had Allens Arthur Robinson, solicitors, personally deliver to Mr Bax a letter terminating Food Improvers' and his consultancy agreement with immediate effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">The letter alleged that there had been intentional disobedience, serious breach of duty and wilful neglect in the discharge of Food Improvers' and Mr Bax's obligations under the consultancy agreement by refusing to participate with Mr Gulson in important negotiations with Petrus and Biomor London the previous week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">Also, on that day Allens Arthur Robinson, served Food Improvers with a notice of general meeting of BGR to be held on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">The business of the meeting was to remove Mr Bax as director of BGR and ratify the actions of Mr Gulson as chairman in terminating the employment of Mr Gobert and BGR's consultancy agreement with Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">127 Allens Arthur Robinson wrote to Mr Gobert, on Mr Gulson's instructions, that he was to be dismissed under his employment agreement dated 1 July 2004 because of his serious and wilful misconduct, and conduct which, in BGR's reasonable opinion, would detrimentally affect his business 'by you refusing to participate with Mr Gulson in important negotiations with Petrus and Biomor, Israeli incorporated companies, in London last week'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">The stated reason was untrue to Mr Gulson's knowledge because he had summarily dismissed Mr Gobert and told him to go home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">128 The instructions to the solicitors do not appear to have been rational, however Mr Gulson may have appeared to those to whom he spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">And he caused those letters to be sent within hours of his earlier fax referring to 'business as usual'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Nothing had happened in between to warrant such a radical change of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">In his mentally distressed state Mr Gulson was using, and evincing an intention to continue to use, his powers as the controlling shareholder to exclude Mr Bax from their partnership and management of their joint enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">And, Mr Gulson, was using this power to advance his own interests to the detriment of Mr Bax's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">129 Over the ensuing weeks Mr Gulson's behaviour became even more irrational.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">He had Allens Arthur Robinson write to Mr Bax's solicitors on 22 June 2005 asserting that they had been validly retained by BGR via Mr Gulson and that the instructions given by Mr Gulson, including as to the termination of the consultancy agreement between BGR, Mr Bax and Food Improvers 'were made in consultation with and with the agreement of Mr Cordato'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Two matters flow from that assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">First, Mr Cordato was not then a director of BGR, although he was a shareholder, so his involvement in the management of the partnership would have been a change made without Mr Bax's involvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Secondly, Mr Cordato in evidence denied that he had agreed with those steps being taken as at 10 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">I accept Mr Cordato's evidence that he had had no involvement with Mr Gulson's decision or instructions reflected in the three letters dated 10 June 2005 sent by Allens Arthur Robinson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">Only later in June 2005, did he decide to side with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">130 In late June 2005 Mr Bax, Mr Gobert and Mr Lawson decided to set up a new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">They caused Unifect International Pty Limited to be incorporated as an Australian company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">Mr Bax's wife, Mr Gobert and Mr Lawson were its directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">MR GULSON HIRES MR McGILVRAY 
 
131 Mr Gulson rang Mr McGilvray on 12 June 2005 and told him that after he had sacked Mr Gobert, Mr Bax had defended Mr Gobert's performance and he asked for Mr Bax's resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">Mr Gulson enquired about possible replacements for Mr Gobert and Mr McGilvray put himself forward as a consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">A few days later Mr Gulson offered him a position as Main Camp's sales and marketing executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">They agreed to meet during the Primex show.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">They agreed Mr McGilvray would continue to run his own business and act as a consultant in an executive capacity for Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">132 Mr McGilvray was known to Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato to be in competition with Main Camp for the sale of tea tree oil, although on a much smaller scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">He disclosed his customer list and then later, on 8 July 2005 would sign a confidentiality clause in respect of Main Camp's commercially sensitive information as part of his and his company's (A-Oil Pty Ltd) consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">Mr McGilvray was allowed by Mr Gulson, with Mr Cordato's knowledge, to retain the right to carry on his own business while he acted as Mr Gobert's replacement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">Mr McGilvray did not have Mr Gobert's technical expertise but he had marketing experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Mr Cordato recognised that Mr McGilvray would be selling tea tree oil to customers in Australia and overseas for two competing vendors: Main Camp and his own company.. 
 
133 Mr McGilvray began work with Main Camp on 4 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">He said that he had offered to transfer his existing business customers to Main Camp if 'we can get Main Camp up and running properly' although the evidence did not reveal the criteria by which this would be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The contract dated 8 July 2005 for his consultancy, through A-Oil, has no such provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">But Mr McGilvray saw this and his own sense of ethics as meeting any potential difficulties with what would otherwise be a conflict of interest and duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">MR GULSON'S MENTAL STATE 
 
134 Mr Williams had found Mr Gulson's behaviour on his visit on 7 June 2005 so intolerable that he wrote a letter of resignation on 10 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">In that letter he referred to the fact that Mr Bax had been able to keep Mr Gulson away from valued staff and the company over the previous 5 years in which Mr Bax had been the CEO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">He referred to Mr Gulson's ego as destroying the professional credibility of all the staff and employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">He sent a copy of that letter to Mr Anderson of Elders, the group's financier, as well as to Messrs Bax, Cordato and Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">135 On 15 June 2005 Mrs Gulson went with her husband to see Dr Newman Harris, his treating psychiatrist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Dr Harris described Mr Gulson's mental condition from the time of that consultation in his report of 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">He had seen Mr Gulson first in June 2000 and had last seen him in March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">On 15 June 2005 Mr Gulson was plainly more elevated than Dr Harris had seen him in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">Dr Harris wrote:
 
 'He provided an over inclusive, circumstantial account of some chaotic and substantial disruptions which had developed in his business affairs with the breakdown of his relationship of his long time partner, friend and confidant, and it was plain that his behaviour was having an adverse impact upon his relationships and his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">' 
 

136 Mrs Gulson gave Dr Harris a note at that consultation in which she described her husband as aggressive, irrational, manic, inconsiderate, inappropriate, unable to be reasoned with, impulsive and abusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">She said that some day he '... will go over the top and hurt someone'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">And she also said he was bullying, overtalking and would 'only [have things] his way'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">She recorded that he had been emotionally and verbally abusive and that he could not be reasoned with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">She recorded that the family were all walking on eggshells and that Mr Gulson had 'nil communication skills'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">There were rules for him and then rules for everyone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">She said he was speeding in the car and threatening people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">137 In the next weeks Mr Gulson continued to manifest symptoms of his illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">Mr Williams, whose evidence I accept, described Mr Gulson's odd appearance and behaviour at the time of the Primex Show in Casino around 16 to 18 June 2005 and his drinking and threatening behaviour towards staff at Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">When Mr Gulson returned to Main Camp on about 22 June 2005 Mr Williams described how he continued to act in a bizarre and threatening manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">138 In the meantime Dr Harris saw Mr and Mrs Gulson on 20 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">The doctor recorded in his notes incidents involving Mr Gulson's driving in a manner which was irresponsible and highly dangerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">Mrs Gulson referred to her fear he might become violent and the overbearing behaviour he was exhibiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Mr Gulson refused to be hospitalised even though Dr Harris had raised the possibility of compulsorily detaining him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">Dr Harris noted he agreed to go to Main Camp, where, as I have found, his behaviour deteriorated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">139 Throughout Mr Gulson's visits in June 2005 the staff at Main Camp plantation continued to express concern to Mr Williams about being able to cope with him and his behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">They also expressed concerns to him about what would happen in the absence of Mr Bax and Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Mr Williams felt concerned about the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">140 On 23 June 2005 Mr Williams sent a fax to Mr Bax and Mr Cordato noting that Mr Gulson had been acting in a totally irrational and uncontrollable rage and had displayed aggression towards the employees of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">Mr Williams said he had grave fears for the staff and employees and that Mr Gulson had admitted to him that he had a serious mental problem and was seeking medical help to control the illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">He said that Mr Gulson had guns on the property and feared for the safety of employees at work and the safety of employees and their families who lived on the property and was seriously concerned for the safety of the staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">141 On 27 June 2005 Mrs Gulson wanted to have Mr Gulson 'scheduled' by Dr Harris (under s 21(1) of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">That would have had the effect of making him an involuntary patient of a mental hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">Instead, Mr Gulson agreed to attend the Northside Clinic, a psychiatric hospital, voluntarily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">By 28 June, when he was admitted to the Northside Clinic, Dr Harris had written a schedule and alerted the local mental health team.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">He was moments from faxing the schedule to them for action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">He said, with his own emphasis in his letter to the clinic of 30 June:
 
 'It remains my opinion that, other than his preparedness to accept treatment, Fred is plainly detainable under the Mental Health Act in view of his obvious signs of mania and the adverse impact this disorder is having on his affairs and his relationships, both business and personal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">' 
 

142 I am of opinion that Mr Cordato also perceived that this was the mental state which Mr Gulson had been exhibiting over the previous few weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">Mr Cordato knew that Mr Gulson has been admitted to the Northside Clinic when he voted on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">MR CORDATO SUPPORTS MR GULSON 
 
143 Although during June 2005 Mr Cordato was receiving clear warnings about Mr Gulson's mental state and abusive behaviour, he decided to support Mr Gulson in the dispute with Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">He asserted that this was because he perceived in the days after 10 June 2005, that Mr Bax and Mr Gobert had mismanaged the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">He claimed that when he voted at the BGR meeting on 1 July 2005 in favour of ratifying Mr Gulson's termination of Mr Gobert's services that that was in the group's best interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">This, he said, was because of conversations he had had with Mr McGilvray and he had 'seen a few financial records of the company and I considered that the sales and marketing program wasn't working effectively'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">He knew that Mr Gulson had selected that financial information which included mostly sales reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">144 Mr Cordato said he formed the view that he should vote to ratify Mr Gobert's termination after discussion with Mr McGilvray and his review of the financial material Mr Gulson had selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Mr Cordato said he considered the sale prices Mr Bax and Mr Gobert were selling the tea tree oil for were the result of a flawed strategy and this justified his vote in relation to Mr Gobert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">However, he asserted that he did not know enough about the industry to be able to answer the question of whether people bargained for the price at which a sale of oil occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">This showed that Mr Cordato allowed himself to be easily persuaded into backing Mr Gulson without any serious ability on his part to analyse what he was being told about commercial issues by Mr McGilvray or Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Mr McGilvray had, and had disclosed, his own conflict of interest and duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">145 On his evidence Mr Cordato did not even know how prices in the industry were set.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">Yet he concluded that Mr Bax and Mr Gobert had a flawed strategy while Mr Gulson, whose mental state was evidently very disturbed, had a better one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Mr Cordato knew that Mr Gulson had no rational basis for summarily dismissing Mr Gobert and had given instructions to Allens Arthur Robinson to write to Mr Gobert on 10 June 2005 asserting falsely, that Mr Gobert's sacking by Mr Gulson was justified because Mr Gobert had 'refused to participate with Mr Gulson' in the Biomor negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Indeed, before the letter was sent, Mr Chilton of Allens Arthur Robinson had spoken with Mr Cordato and told him the reasons for the resolutions which were in the letters of 10 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">Mr Cordato said he was 'a bit taken aback' and, in relation to Mr Bax's position '... a little bit lost for words when I was given the reasons by Mr Chilton'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">Even though he knew Mr Gulson had told him of his sacking Mr Gobert in London, he did not draw this to Mr Chilton's attention whom he knew was acting on instructions that Mr Gobert should have continued the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">Mr Cordato gave this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">
 'Did you discuss whether in light of Mr Gulson's then psychiatric condition it was advisable to continue with the meeting or suggest adjourning it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">--- I didn't raise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">
 
 Why not?</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">--- The Triad Health Products group of companies is a - is a family company in which Mr Gulson and his wife are joint directors and I believe they're joint shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">His wife had given the proxy and it's -well, as far as I was concerned, her instructions were as - I could see it was - the whole meeting was regularised because she was representing and instructing on behalf of the Triad Health Products group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">
 ... 
 
 So and you had seen it as being in the best interests of the company, at least on 8 June, for Mr Bax and Mr Gulson to continue working together, albeit that that had not succeeded at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">Is that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">--- Yes, I saw that is in the best interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">
 And that the events of 10 June which had been a little unexpected, from your point of view, of the Allens' letters coming to advise of this meeting being called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">Is that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">--- Yes, that's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">
 
 Did you think that there was something about the way Mr Gulson was behaving which required his admission to treatment that might have suggested that the time was not ripe then to take decisive action as that meeting of 1 July was taking place?</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">--- Now, I guess your Honour's assuming that, you know, his condition was "disturbed", in your words, throughout but he wasn't, he was - there - he was rational a lot of the time but disturbed at other times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">I - I saw it but there was a parting of the ways, that Fred's wife was well capable of making decisions and she had decided to go ahead with the meeting and that was that and being the majority shareholder, one has to take a little bit of heed of what the majority shareholder thinks and that's what I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">
 
 So you took heed of what you thought the majority shareholder thought?</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">--- What I knew the majority shareholder thought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">
 
 Yes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">--- I didn't see it as my place to - to stamp any authority, I mean 8 per cent is just a trivial amount, a trivial share-holding and it doesn't even have a blocking interest let alone a decisive interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">' (emphasis added) 

146 Mr Cordato was then not aware of what, if any role Mrs Gulson had played in the management of the BGR group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">He assumed, wrongly, that she was a director and shareholder of Triad on 1 July 2005, when only Mr Gulson was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">As Mr Cordato said, he took heed of what the majority shareholder thought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">I am of opinion that Mr Cordato sided with Mr Gulson and voted in favour of the resolutions be proposed because he saw it as in his own financial interests to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">THE BGR MEETING OF 1 JULY 2005 
 
147 Mr Bax, as Food Improvers' proxy, attended the general meeting of BGR on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">Mr Chilton had Triad's proxy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">Mr Cordato was elected as chair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">The resolutions were carried over Food Improvers' dissent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">Mr Bax then resigned as a director of all the BGR group companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">148 The defendants argued that Mr Bax could not complain of being excluded from the management of BGR because he voluntarily resigned from all the other directorships of BGR's subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">This argument does not recognise that, first, Mr Bax had been removed as a director of BGR in which Food Improvers had a shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">Secondly, the meeting had just confirmed the termination of Food Improvers' consultancy agreement, this denying Mr Bax remuneration for any work he may do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">The express reasons for the resolutions were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Thirdly, he was susceptible of being removed immediately from any of those directorships at Mr Gulson's behest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">Fourthly, once he was not on the board of the parent company, BGR, Mr Bax's ability to exercise the powers of a partner or executive in the business of BGR as parent of the group had been removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">His powers as a director of these companies were limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">He had, in that position, no authority over staff or to deal with the group's creditors, customers or financiers as he previously had done when managing director or chief executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Fifthly, Mr Gobert was not to be employed, contrary to Mr Bax's wishes, and had no consultancy agreement in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">Lastly, Mr Gulson had made plain that he would use his voting power to impose his will.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">149 Moreover, Mr Cordato had sided with Mr Gulson and Mr Gulson's previous irrational and mentally disturbed conduct was likely to continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">Having lost his position as a director of BGR and Mr Gulson's recognition of him as an equal partner in the business, together with his contractual right (through Food Improvers' consultancy) to income, Mr Bax had no reason to remain as director of the subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">There he would have had all the responsibilities and potential liabilities, including for insolvent trading, and only formal powers under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), to conduct the business of subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato had demonstrated by no later than the meeting of 1 July 2005 that Mr Bax had lost his position as an equal partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">150 In those circumstances, the basis on which Mr Bax and Mr Gulson conducted BGR's affairs after Mr Reece's departure had been radically changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">Mr Bax had been stripped of his position as a partner in BGR itself and chief executive of the BGR group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">His continued participation in the group's, but not BGR's affairs, in an unremunerated position held at Mr Gulson's pleasure would have been a very diminished role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">In those circumstances I do not consider it appropriate to draw any adverse inference against Mr Bax for resigning the other directorships after the meeting had carried the resolutions proposed by Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">As Mr Gulson said:
 
 'MR LEVER: You made the decision or you acted on the decision to instruct Allens to write the three letters after your meeting with Cordato and Bax on 8 June 2005; you agree with that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">--- That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">
 
 That was a meeting at which the three of you agreed, and in particular you and John Bax agreed, that there would be no organisational changes within BGR?</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">--- And that was before certain correspondence was drawn to my attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">
 
 What correspondence would that be?</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">--- First of all a letter from Haywards to me, copies the staff up at the plantation had sent down the reward whatever, and I got through various other members of staff plaintive letters of what a bugger Fred Gulson is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">I thought this is a planned smear campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">I thought a number of the letters were puerile, I thought the reward poster was - and to be sent to all staff, was most inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">It had been sent to me, that's fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">So it was fairly destructive and I thought to myself, this is going to go on and on and on and I'm not going to be a party to engaging in such school boy type activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">And I was also concerned that we had our plantation manager writing letters which were singularly unhelpful and overstepping the line and I could just see this going on and on and on so I thought the best way to do this is to take John out of the operational arm by BGR and leave him as a director for all the other companies, including the companies that had the assets, but that's how I left it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">(emphasis added) 
 
 He explained what he meant:
 
 HIS HONOUR: Mr Gulson, I don't understand how you could have done that if you were going to leave Mr Bax as a director, as you as you intended, of all the companies with assets, how that would give effect to what you were saying to me you wanted to do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">--- Well, it would leave him - you know, those land holding company and whatever, there wouldn't be that day to day involvement that he would have as a consultant but he would still have equal, you know, as a director, one of two directors, control over the assets, the trading assets and the land, you know, $9 million plus, so it was only removing him from his consultancy agreement, formalising that and removing him as a director of one of 12 companies, being the holding company, with all the other companies involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">Now, he chose not to be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">
 
 I just don't understand why removing him as a director of the holding company was necessary if you were leaving him as director of the other companies?</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">--- Simply because I wanted to deal with the consultancy agreement and formalise that properly and then make sure, you know, that he's got no further - whatever activities he wanted to engage in to destabilise the company, that he was doing that not on BGRs premises, but I didn't have a problem with him being a director of all of the remaining companies, including the ones with the assets, because he could deal with that arm's length with somebody like Tony Cordato or somebody else present, but not on a day to day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Not with this correspondence and things coming through.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">' 
 
 (emphasis added) 

151 That evidence made clear that Mr Gulson intended to remove Mr Bax as a partner but to keep the benefit and control of their joint enterprise in his effective power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">MR GULSON'S MEDICAL HISTORY 
 
152 In his original affidavit, Mr Gulson gave a very truncated version of his medical condition and admission to the Caritas Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">That affidavit was sworn in the proceedings to resist applications made by the plaintiffs to Hely J for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">Mr Gulson said that on 3 July 2005 he '... checked into the Caritas Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">At that time I was under extreme stress and on recommendation it was decided that it was in my best interests to rest and receive dedicated medical attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">My condition was, and I wish it remained [sic], a private matter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">153 He also said that his stay at the Caritas Centre 'was welcome and beneficial' and that on 12 July 2005 when his family returned from an overseas trip he left the Centre and had resumed his ordinary activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">154 On 2 July 2005 Mr Gulson was scheduled under s 21 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">made an involuntary patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">That was because he had disappeared from the Northside Clinic and went to stay at a hotel in the city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">The police came to the hotel early in the morning and he was taken away to the Caritas Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">It was false to say he 'checked into' the Caritas Centre, which conveyed volition on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">155 On 4 July 2005, doctors at the Caritas Centre recorded a history in which Mr Gulson told them that recently he 'has had to sack employees that were undermining him in front of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">This was a spontaneous decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">(This was obviously reference to Mr Bax and Mr Gobert) It was also recorded that he thought his medication was working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">156 At a discharge interview on 12 July 2005 with his family and his treating doctors, Mr Gulson said he believed that he was at a turning point and felt optimistic about things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">Dr Richardson advised him and the family to take a break from business for a couple of months and that he should not travel or be involved in anything complex, including business dealings for a few months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">Despite that advice, Mr Gulson went straight back to the affairs of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">Moreover that advice was not revealed in his affidavit of 20 July 2005 which portrayed Mr Gulson as fit for the work he had resumed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">157 After I ruled on 10 July 2006 (see The Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corporation Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1238) , that the plaintiffs should be able to have access to documents produced on subpoenas they had issued seeking information about Mr Gulson's treatment by Dr Harris and the Caritas Centre, Mr Gulson swore an affidavit on 30 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">He said:
 
 'I recall feeling under extreme stress in about June 2005 as a result of Mr Bax abdicating his responsibilities to the BGR group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">I seek to refer to paragraph 18 of my affidavit sworn 20 July 2005 to correct and amplify some of the matters referred to therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">I consulted Dr Newman Harris, psychiatrist on or about 15 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">I voluntarily admitted myself into the Northside Clinic at Greenwich where I was seen by Dr Newman Harris on 28 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">I was subsequently admitted to Caritas on 2 July 2005 and discharged from there on 12 July 2005'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">(30/7/06 par 23) 

158 Dr Harris had told Mr Gulson on 28 June 2005 that he had to go to a hospital such as the Northside Clinic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">Mr Gulson said that he did not recall whether Dr Harris told him that if he did not check himself in voluntarily, he would schedule him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">Mr Gulson also recalled that his wife had told him that if he did not check himself into an institution for his mental care she would leave him taking their children with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">He regarded that as a strong inducement to admit himself on 28 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">He also agreed Dr Harris may have suggested to Mr Gulson that he be admitted to hospital on 15 or 20 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">Given his disturbed mental state at the time, including his lack of sleep, Mr Gulson's memory of that time is likely to have been affected, as he accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">159 While the matter may have been of some considerable personal embarrassment and distressing to raise both in affidavits and in open court, Mr Gulson was fully aware of the importance of being honest in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">At one stage earlier in his career he had been admitted to practice as a lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">He also knew that it was important to tell the truth in his affidavit of 20 July 2005 because it would be used before Hely J to resist interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">Notwithstanding this, Mr Gulson provided an account of his medical treatment which was incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">While he may have been suffering from effects of his condition on 20 July 2005 so that one could understand his lack of candour in the affidavit he swore that day, on 30 July 2006, Mr Gulson was fully aware of the issue in the proceedings that was raised concerning his mental health and his consequent behaviour in May 2005 and following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">He said that he was seeking to 'correct and amplify some of the matters referred to in his affidavit of 20 July 2005 on this issue' but the economy of his revelation in both affidavits hid the nature and extent of his real condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">In July 2005, Mr Gulson may not have had sufficient insight into his own condition to appreciate that, or the extent to which, manifestations of his condition had affected him and his relations with others including Mr Bax over the preceding two moths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">But by 30 July 2006 he gave a carefully crafted 'correction' and 'amplification' which was revealing for its lack of candour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">160 The account of 30 July 2006 on close reading reveals that he used the word 'voluntary' in relation to the admission to the Northside Clinic, but simply said that he was 'admitted' to Caritas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">Absent background knowledge of the circumstances of his admission to the Caritas Centre, the omission of the word 'voluntary' in the account is not particularly amplificatory or corrective especially since the word 'admitted' was used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">The significance of the fact that Mr Gulson was 'scheduled' under s 21 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) is that it reflected the seriousness of his mental condition and his own inability to be relied on to remain an ordinary member of the community and participate in business matters while suffering from his mental disturbance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">Indeed, Mr Gulson had consulted, while in the Caritas centre with Mr Cordato with a view to taking proceedings to secure his release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">In cross-examination Mr Gulson was evasive about his involuntary admission to the Caritas Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">He said he had discussed the phrasing of his earlier (20 July 2005) affidavit on this topic with his then solicitors, at Allens Arthur Robinson, and believed what it said was truthful and accurate but then made a claim for privilege which was not challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">I have difficulty accepting this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">However, Mr Gulson was clearly mentally sick at the time and I find that his evidence was unreliable on this point, rather than deliberately dishonest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">161 Mr Gulson's conduct in relation to the use of his evidence in his affidavits as to his own mental condition and his subsequent attempt to correct and amplify his earlier evidence, reveal that he was conscious of the impact that this may have on the assessment of his contemporaneous conduct and credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">Mr Gulson's lack of candour about this, although perfectly understandable in human terms because of its embarrassment to him, detracts from the reliability of his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">It suited him to give the account he did in his affidavit when resisting claims for interlocutory relief based on his behaviour in mid 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">I was not impressed by his veracity in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">SALE OF MAIN CAMP 
 
162 Mr Bax, Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson met on 12 September 2005 with Mr McGrath of Elders Real Estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">They decided to appoint Mr McGrath as the agent for sale of Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">There had been some discussions shortly before this between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">Mr Bax had been providing assistance to the Main Camp group by restructuring some of its financial accounts for the purposes of providing a financial information package to potential tenderers following assurances by Mr Gulson at a meeting at Main Camp plantation on 31 August 2005 that he would be consulted in the sale process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">Those assurances were repeated at the meeting on 12 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">163 After Mr McGrath left, Mr Gulson said that he wanted Mr Bax to come back as the director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">Mr Bax declined the request and Mr Cordato said that he could understand Mr Bax's position and did not see the need to press ahead with Mr Gulson's proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">Mr Gulson did not mention anything about the reinstatement of Food Improver's consultancy agreement if Mr Bax did come back as a director of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">Nor did he suggest that Mr Bax would resume his previous position as managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">164 Mr Gulson acknowledged in evidence that Mr Bax had provided most helpful financial projections and figures in the process of arranging the sale of Main Camp plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">No remuneration was given to Mr Bax for that work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">Mr Gulson said that that was because Mr Bax did not ask to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">He did not offer to reinstate Food Improvers' consultancy agreement or to pay fees to Mr Bax should he return as a director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Mr Gulson's explanation was that if Mr Bax came back as a director it would be 'obvious' that the consultancy agreement would be reinstated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">Mr Gulson asserted that it was common sense that that was what he meant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">He asserted that he would not have said to Mr Bax 'Come back as a director, work on the sale and get nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">' 
 
165 I do not accept Mr Gulson's evidence that the position was as he asserted it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">First, as he said, he did not pay or offer to pay Mr Bax for the work he did on the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">Rather he expected Mr Bax to ask for payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">Secondly, the offer of a directorship of BGR which Mr Gulson made to Mr Bax was not a return to the position before June 2005 in which Mr Bax would hold office as managing director and have a consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">I am of opinion that Mr Bax acted reasonably in rejecting the offer because it would have left him in a much reduced position compared to that which he had enjoyed as an equal partner prior to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">166 During the meeting of 12 September Mr Cordato opposed paying Triad and Food Improvers any consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">He became quite agitated and said that he would not agree to any consultancy fees being paid to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">Mr Bax noted the then draft deed of agreement for settlement of the dispute provided that both Mr Gulson and he, through their respective companies, were to be paid the same amount for consultancy fees plus interest and that Triad would receive more interest than Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">He noted that after payment of those fees, the balance was to be distributed by way of fully franked dividends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">Mr Cordato threw his pen down on the table and turned aggressively to Mr Bax saying that he did not care, he was not approving BGR paying any consulting fees or interest to Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">He said that those amounts were not in the management accounts of BGR or the accounts prepared by KPMG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Mr Bax replied that the amounts were not in the accounts because accruing the fees would have made the accounts far worse than they were and it would mean that both Mr Gulson's and his companies would have had to take up the accrued income which would be treated as assessable even though they had not received any funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">He said that the accounts prepared by KPMG were special purpose accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">They were prepared to support the BGR group's tax return based on the management accounts and had not been altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">Accordingly the special purpose accounts did not contain all the disclosures that would be made in statutory accounts which was why they were called 'special purpose' accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">167 Mr Cordato again threw his pen down on the table and said that if the consulting fees were not in the accounts then he had been misled as a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">Mr Bax replied that Mr Cordato knew very well the difficult trading conditions that the group had faced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">He said that Mr Cordato had drafted the consultancy agreements and that BGR could not meet his obligations to pay the fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Mr Cordato reiterated that he was not agreeing to any payments being made to Mr Bax and that was it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">He said that any distributions were to be made according to the shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Mr Gulson remained silent throughout this exchange and the meeting ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">168 Mr Gulson, in his account of this conversation, asserted that Mr Cordato had said with respect to the consultancy fees:
 
 'John all this is news to me, the first time this issue pops up is in your solicitor's draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">There is no mention of these fees anywhere in the group's books of account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">' 

169 When confronted with the fact that Mr Bax had claimed over $1 million in consultancy fees in his affidavit of 11 July 2005, some two months before this meeting, Mr Gulson asserted that he was not aware of that fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">I do not accept Mr Gulson's evidence about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">He must have been fully aware that Mr Bax was claiming over a million dollars in consultancy fees once any information about the proceedings had been given to him following his discharge from hospital on 12 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">Besides having Mr Cordato as a source of information he had had Allens Arthur Robinson act for Triad and BGR in the proceedings and then Kemp Strang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Moreover, negotiations for settlement of the proceedings were taking place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">It is inconceivable that Mr Gulson had no knowledge of Mr Bax's claim for consultancy fees or their quantum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">Moreover, Mr Cordato, in his evidence denied saying at the 12 September meeting that the claim was all news to him and that the first time the issue popped up was in the solicitor's drafts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">As he said 'I am certain I didn't say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">I knew all about the other fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">' 
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTION B 
 
170 After the meeting of 12 September 2005, Mr Bax contacted Mr Lombardo at KPMG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">Mr Bax had prepared two scenarios, which came to be called options A and B, for the distribution of the proceeds of sale among the shareholders of BGR and faxed these to Mr Lombardo on 20 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">Option A contemplated that each of Triad and Food Improvers would be paid consultancy fees totalling $1,040,849 together with interest on those fees of $276,001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Option B provided for the payment to Food Improvers of $500,000 for consultancy fees including interest and then for the distribution of the balance of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp without any accounting for consultancy fees for Triad or the balance due to Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">After he had spoken to Mr Gulson about the two options, Mr Bax also sent a copy of this fax to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">A meeting was arranged at KPMG for 22 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">Mr Bax told Mr Gulson that the preferred scenario, following discussions with Mr Lombardo, was option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">THE 22 SEPTEMBER 2005 MEETING 
 
171 Mr Bax, Mr Cordato, Mr Gulson, Mr Lombardo and one of Mr Lombardo's assistants met at KPMG's offices at about 10:00 am on 22 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">I have already described part of this meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">During the course of the meeting, Mr Bax explained that option B provided that his consultancy fees would be fixed at $500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">Mr Gulson nodded his head in agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">Mr Bax explained that the way option B worked was that the amount of consultancy fees and interest ($500,000) would be paid to Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">The balance of the sale proceeds would then be distributed by way of fully franked dividends to each of the shareholders in accordance with its shareholding proportion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">On receipt of those fully franked dividends, each shareholder would repay its shareholder's loan account (this would restore a very substantial amount of cash to BGR, which would then be available for distribution).</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">Mr Bax explained that BGR would then pay a further dividend from the cash it then had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">Each of options A and B showed the steps involved in this methodology based on an assumption that the net proceeds of the sale of Main Camp would be about $6.345 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">172 In both options, all the dividends were fully franked because BGR had sufficient franking credits to enable that to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">However, in option A, each of Triad and Food Improvers had to pay 30% company tax on the amounts of consultancy fees and interest which they were to receive, so that the net sum ultimately distributed to each, after tax, would be about $3.6 million (or 65% of the assumed amount available for distribution of $6.345 million) for Triad, $1.4 million (or 25%) for Food Improvers and $515,000 (or 9%) for Cordato Partners Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">173 In option B the figures were different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">This was because Triad would receive the whole of its proceeds as dividends, and only Food Improvers would receive $500,000 in respective of consultancy fees, Triad, in option B, would receive about $4.1 million (or 67%), Food Improvers would receive $1.35 million (or 22%) and Cordato would receive about $700,000 (or 11%).</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">174 Mr Bax pointed out that option B provided for total cash paid to each of the three shareholders in BGR being more in than option A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">Mr Gulson asked how Mr Bax arrived at the $6.345 million dollars as the net proceeds of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">Mr Bax said that he had estimated the figures based on the sale price of $9 million plus debtors, in the value of cattle and the sale of stock, less the liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">He said that the figures were only estimates and that the actual figures would be used when they were available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">He then said that the $500,000 (for Food Improver's consultancy fee) was fixed and that he would be happy with that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">Mr Cordato expressed agreement with option B as did Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">Mr Gulson's contemporaneous note of that meeting contained the notation 'option B works'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">175 Thereafter, the discussion turned to the mechanics of how the sale proceeds could be dealt with in the most tax effective way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">As noted above, Mr Lombardo urged Mr Bax against receiving any monies by way of consultancy fees, since they would be taxable but Mr Bax resisted that suggestion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">176 In giving their evidence of Mr Bax's explanation during the meeting of 22 September 2005 of how option B worked, each of Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson, in the witness box, did not appear to understand the commercially simple rationale of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Each attempted to reconstruct what Mr Bax had said but in a way which showed that he had no real memory of his explanation and each had no accounting understanding of how option B worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">Nonetheless, I am satisfied, from Mr Lombardo's and Mr Bax's evidence that both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson fully understood, at the meeting of 22 September 2005, that option B provided that Food Improvers be paid $500,000 in respect of consulting fees as a compromise before any distribution of profits, repayment of shareholders loans and further distributions would be made, and that each agreed that the method would be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">177 In final submissions the defendants asserted that the method of distribution made on 23 February 2006 had been agreed prior to the meeting with Mr Lombardo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">They asserted that Mr Bax, Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson met shortly in KPMG's foyer before going up to see Mr Lombardo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">Mr Gulson made no mention of this earlier meeting in his first affidavit account of meeting with Mr Lombardo sworn on 16 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">In his second account sworn on 4 May 2006 he said nothing to indicate that the $500,000 used in option B would not be paid; to the contrary his account was that Mr Bax said he wanted to receive his part of the distribution using that methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">178 Mr Gulson denied Mr Lombardo's account of the meeting in his affidavit sworn on 11 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">In oral evidence he referred to a meeting in KPMG's foyer in which Mr Bax said he wanted to take the $500,000 in option B 'out of my share of the proceeds'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">In cross-examination he asserted that Mr Bax said the $500,000 was to come out of his pro rata share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">Mr Cordato's affidavit of 8 May 2006 makes no mention of a meeting in KPMG's foyer before seeing Mr Lombardo but reaffirms that he $500,000 in option B was part of the methodology proposed by Mr Bax for distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">Mr Bax denied any discussion occurred in the foyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">179 I accept the evidence of Mr Bax and Mr Lombardo that Mr Bax explained in the meeting with Mr Lombardo that he wanted $500,000 paid in respect of consultancy fees under option B before the balance of the sale proceeds was distributed and Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson did not object to that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">This account is supported by the negotiations on the draft agreement and the repeated assertions by Cordato Partners in later correspondence up to January 2006 that the distribution would be in accordance with Option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">180 I do not accept the evidence of Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson that any qualification was made before, at or after the meeting with Mr Lombardo as to how option B would operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">I find that at the time Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson knew that option B necessarily operated by paying the $500,000 to Food Improvers before the balance of the net proceeds of the sale of Main Camp was distributed according to shareholding proportions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">WAS THERE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT TO DISTRIBUTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OPTION B 
 
181 Oddly, each party pleaded that there was a binding agreement to distribute in accordance with option B, though with different results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">182 On 7 October 2005 the plaintiffs' solicitors, sent Kemp Strang and Cordato Partners a further draft deed of agreement which incorporated the distribution of the proceeds of sale, when received, in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">In the draft deed, there was an express term that consultancy fees and interest due to Food Improvers and Mr Bax of $500,000 plus GST from July 2000 to the date of the receipt of the proceeds would be paid out of the proceeds of sale (cl 4(a)(viii)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">There was also a clause providing for a release from any further claim for consultancy fees by Food Improvers and Mr Bax upon payment of that $500,000 plus GST (cl 4(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">Option B was included as a Schedule as the contractual example of how payments contemplated by the deed were to be made (cl 4(f); Schedule 3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">Neither Mr Cordato nor Mr Gulson attended to responding to Haywards draft deed for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">183 On 17 November 2005 Cordato Partners replied on their own behalf and on behalf of Mr Cordato personally with suggested amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">However Cordato Partners charged BGR for writing the letter and I am satisfied that the letter was written on behalf of all of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">In any event, the letter extensively reviewed the provisions of the draft deed, but did not comment on any of the provisions relating to the $500,000 consultancy fee payment, other than to renumber the schedule in which option B appeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">On 23 November 2005 Haywards responded and attached a marked up draft deed which incorporated many of the changes, leaving unchanged the consultancy fee provisions to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">MAIN CAMP SALE - DECEMBER 2005 
 
184 On 12 December 2005 a contract of sale was entered into for Main Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">The price was $9 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">Mr Bax's solicitors sought details from Cordato Partners (who by then acted for all the defendants) of the sale the next day, and again on 5 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">None were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">He had not been consulted on the terms of the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">185 Haywards on 5 January 2006 sought details of what the distribution of the proceeds would be from Cordato Partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">Cordato Partners responded the next day saying that BGR proposed to make a distribution 'along the lines set out in schedule 3 of the draft deed of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">Although not all terms of the deed agreement have been agreed, there is no dispute regarding schedule 3, which we note was prepared by your client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">' They referred to the fact that KPMG would be consulted in the next week as to the methodology for the distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">Schedule 3 was, of course, option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">However, Haywards, on 9 January 2006 attached a copy of option B to their letter and asked for an express confirmation that it was that method of distribution to which Cordato Partners were referring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">On 11 January 2006, Cordato Partners responded saying that there were no longer any settlement discussions on foot and that BGR was proceeding with the sale of Main Camp in accordance with the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">They continued:
 
 'We reiterate the advices in our letter of 6 January 2006 as to the distribution of the proceeds of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">In this respect we confirm that the schedule to which we refer in our letter of 6 January 2006 is the schedule you attach to your letter of 9 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">' 

186 On 31 January 2006 Cordato Partners advised Haywards that completion of the sale had taken place on 23 January 2006, except for an assignment of plant and equipment which was expected to occur in the next week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">They said that BGR was awaiting advice from KPMG in relation to the level of franking credits available before a distribution was made of the sale proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">It was intended, Cordato Partners said, that the distribution would be made as a dividend on a fully franked basis subject to advice that there were sufficient franking credits available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">The letter continued:
 
 'Furthermore, as a distribution by way of dividend will constitute income, will your client continue to require that part of your client's distribution be made as an interest payment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">' 

187 Option B referred to an interest payment in respect of part of the consultancy fee amount of $500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">The reference to an interest payment in the letter could only be construed as a reference to option B. Haywards responded on 1 February 2006 confirming that they understood the proposal was to distribute funds in accordance with option B and invited the payment of the consultancy fees and interest of $500,000 forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">188 Next, on 23 February 2006 without any consultation, BGR, under Mr Gulson's hand, wrote to Food Improvers advising that an interim dividend of $3,500,000 had been declared and was payable as at 22 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">Food Improver's share was $423,841.20 cash after repayment of its shareholder's loan account of $1,483,541.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">A distribution schedule was attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">Food Improvers was credited with franking credits of $817,449.51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">The distribution schedule provided that Triad would be credited with a cash payment of about $2.56 million, after repayment of its loan account of $2.8 million, and Cordato Partners Services would be credited with a dividend of $510,747 after repayment of its loan account of $125,067.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">This was, clearly, radically different to what had been proposed in option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">189 Mr Gulson asserted that he had not taken any interest in the details of the draft settlement deeds and had never read the provisions relating to the payment of a consultancy fee to Food Improvers, and despite the fact that in early October 2005, when Haywards circulated the draft deed incorporating option B, Kemp Strang were acting as BGR's solicitors, he made no enquiries about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">I do not believe Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">He attended the meeting with Mr Lombardo, and had discussions with Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">I am of opinion that it is highly unlikely that Mr Gulson was as disinterested as he sought to portray in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">Rather, he was conscious in giving evidence that the distribution actually made on 22 February 2006 was very different from what he had represented would occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">He agreed that he would have read at least one of the draft deeds that passed between the solicitors during the period following 7 October, including the provisions of cl 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">He said that he would not have paid much attention to what happened in the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">Given that on 3 November 2005 Mr Gulson had written personally on BGR's behalf to Haywards saying that he was considering the draft deed which the shareholders had discussed on several occasions, I am not prepared to believe his assertions that he was not aware of the contents of the draft deeds relating to the payment of consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">190 Mr Gulson asserted that his letter on 3 November 2005 was 'what one does in these sort of situations is you need to buy time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">' He then said that he had had discussions with Mr Bax about settlement and knew that the draft deed needed further work, but asserted that 'that was far as it went'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">When asked how he knew that the draft deed needed further work, he said that Mr Cordato had advised him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">But he then said of the assertion in the letter of 3 November 2005 that the deed had been discussed on several occasions:
 
 'I have got to say I was stretching it a bit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">' 

By which he meant, so he said, 'It doesn't mean telling an untruth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">It means being a little bit more generous ... with the facts'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">191 I formed the view that he was being untruthful as to his knowledge of the draft deed and its contents and was seeking to avoid a finding that he had indicated agreement with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">If what he wrote to Haywards on 3 November was 'stretching it a bit' then that in itself reflects badly on Mr Gulson's credibility and honesty in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">However, I am not satisfied that he was being untruthful in the letter, as opposed to in the witness box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">The course of the correspondence between the solicitors in the period between October 2005 and January 2006 satisfies me that Mr Gulson was fully aware of and, at that stage, had expressed his agreement to a distribution in which $500,000 in respect of consultancy fees and interest would be paid first to Food Improvers before the balance of the proceeds, after payment of external creditors, would be distributed to the shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">PLEADED AGREEMENTS CONCERNING OPTION B 
 
192 Food Improvers' and Mr Bax pleaded that in consideration of the plaintiffs not making an application to the Court to have the sale proceeds paid into Court or similar interlocutory relief, the defendants agreed they would distribute the sale proceeds in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">193 In their defence of 6 March 2006, prepared by Mr Cordato, all the defendants, except Cordato Partners Services, asserted that they had entered into an agreement as to the distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp, after payment of creditors and satisfaction of all financial agreements secured by guarantee and that that agreement had been carried out by the distribution that had been made on 22 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">On 8 March 2006 Haywards sought particulars of that agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">On 16 March 2006 Cordato Partners referred to the correspondence of 6, 9 and 11 January 2006 and option B as constituting the written part of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">It was then asserted that no amount had been agreed to be paid by way of consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">194 The further amended defences filed later assert that an agreement had been reached for distribution to be made to the shareholders of BGR from the proceeds of Main Camp station 'along these lines'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">It was then asserted that the 'lines' were that the external creditors would be satisfied, an amount would be available for distribution to be paid in accordance with shareholding entitlement after repayment of loan accounts and using tax advice to find the most tax effective means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">195 For the reasons that I have given, I am of opinion that the negotiations culminating in the letter of 11 January 2006 all proceeded upon the basis that the method of distribution would be in accordance with option B, and that that included a payment, before any dividend, of $500,000 to Food Improvers by way of consultancy fees and interest thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">The defendants' alleged contract is untenable because it, first, ignores the correspondence adopting option B and, secondly, asserts that option B was 'agreed' but then spells out an 'agreement' which does not reflect option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">No consideration for Food Improvers giving up the $500,000 or its other rights to consultancy fees is pleaded to support that contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">There is no evidence that the plaintiffs knew of, let alone, agreed to the terms which the defendants plead as a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">196 I am also of opinion that the correspondence on which the plaintiffs rely does not give rise to a legally binding agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">Rather, Haywards sought in their letter of 5 January 2006 an identification of BGR's intentions as to the method of distribution failing which they would take steps to protect Food Improvers' interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">Cordato Partners' response of 6 January set out those intentions, which were to proceed with the distribution in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">On 9 January 2006 Haywards responded asking what the defendants' position was with respect to execution of the draft Deed and seeking confirmation that the distribution that was proposed would be in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">The response of 11 January 2006 from Cordato Partners indicated, clearly, that settlement negotiations were no longer on foot but that option B was the intended method of distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">197 I am not satisfied that this correspondence can be read as giving rise to a legally enforceable contract to distribute in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">Rather, Haywards sought and received an indication of the intention which the defendants had for distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">At the time the January letters were written, the intention of the defendants was to distribute in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">But I do not consider that these letters were anything more than representations of an intention, as opposed to a promise, to distribute in accordance with the intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">And, I am of opinion that Haywards' letter of 1 February 2006 confirms that the preceding correspondence was not understood as giving rise to a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">In that letter they say: 
 
 'We understand that you propose to distribute fund in accordance with the example distribution suggested by our clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">Whilst reserving their rights with respect to those matters pleaded in the present Federal Court proceedings, and notwithstanding the absence of a concluded agreement between the parties, our clients are content for the distribution to be made in accordance with the example distribution at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">' 

198 This shows that reading of the correspondence which I have concluded to be appropriate was that understood by the plaintiffs' solicitors at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">The fact that in their letter of 11 January 2006, Cordato Partners stated that settlement negotiations were no longer on foot, indicated that there had been no concluded agreement beforehand and whatever consensus had been reached on option B, it was not a legally binding consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">DEFENDANTS' CONDUCT AFTER JUNE 2005 
 
 TRIAD'S CONSULTANCY FEES 
 
199 After the meeting on 1 July 2005 Mr Bax was effectively excluded from any management functions in BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">Mr Bax remained personally liable on some guarantees he had given to creditors of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">Mr Gulson assumed sole executive control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">He increased the amount which Triad was paid under the consultancy agreements to the sum of $20,000 per month commencing in September 2005, following a conversation between Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato in which Mr Gulson asked for the increase and Mr Cordato agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">Triad continued to draw its monthly fee following completion of the sale of Main Camp plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">200 Mr Gulson asserted that the work he undertook justified the increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">He said he was working full time, at times it was very stressful and that he was doing at least the work of two people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">He created a document which purported to set out an itemised description, month by month of the work which he claimed to have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">201 The document he prepared covered what he said was the work undertaken between June 2005 and 5 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">For June 2005 a page of activities was listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">These included attending Allens Arthur Robinsons, a two day attendance at Main Camp with Mr McGilvray and Mr Williams on a proposed marketing plan designed specifically to lift the per kilo selling price of tea-tree oil (about which neither Mr McGilvray or Mr Williams gave evidence).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">He also included an item 'attending to daily statutory filings'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">When his attention was drawn to that in cross-examination, simply responded 'Yeah yeah, that's a nonsense; that's wrong, it is and shouldn't have been there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">' He then suggested that the entry was to be read as attending to statutory filings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">When asked what that involved he said that this was material 'inputted by a computer, check it off, check that it's accurate and press the button'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">He was challenged that he did not do that and responded 'Yes I did, and before I could use a computer I had our accountant check it off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">' The statutory filings which were made by members of the group during the period were the subject of a Notice to Produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">This became an exhibit in the proceedings (Exhibit N) and consisted of over fifty business activity statements and instalment activity statements prepared for various companies within the group by the group's accountant, Ms Bojanovic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">All but one were signed by Ms Bojanovic, the exception being a business activity statement of BGR signed by Mr Gulson on 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">The statements covered the period between July 2005 and October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">I am not satisfied that Mr Gulson did any work on these statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">He was not an accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">Nor is he proficient in fiscal matters to do with the business (which was why Mr Bax handled such matters).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">202 Next Mr Gulson was asked about his assertion of spending considerable time with Minter Ellison in discussing issues relating to the BARM litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">When cross-examined about that claim, he said that he would probably have dealt with Minter Ellison at least once or twice a fortnight in a detailed way and would otherwise deal with one of its taxation partners, Mr Aitken, in a more relaxed way over coffee because he was trying to keep the bills down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">However in Minter Ellison's timesheets for the period between July 2005 and August 2006 Mr Gulson's name is referred to on less than ten occasions, five of which related to discussions in June 2006 and one in relation to attendances in August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">Mr Gulson asserted that times he spent with Mr Aitken were not recorded because Mr Aitken did not charge for that time, although he was the partner in charge and his name appeared on the top of the timesheets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">However, a number of the entries in which Mr Gulson's name appeared in the timesheets involved Mr Aitken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">I do not accept Mr Gulson's evidence that he had one to two meetings or dealings per fortnight with Minter Ellison during this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">203 Among other entries which Mr Gulson propounded in his exhibit so as to justify his increase in consultancy fees, were attendances with Kemp Strang, solicitors, (who were acting for BGR and Triad in the litigation,) meeting with Mr Bax concerning a proposal for sale of the property 'and other matters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">I accept that Mr Gulson's executive responsibilities increased with Mr Bax's departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">But during June and July 2005 I infer that Mr Gulson was unable to spend anything like the amount of time he had previously or would in the future spend on the business because of his mental illness and hospitalisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">204 By the time that the sale of Main Camp plantation had been completed, there was very little substantial work for Mr Gulson to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">This is borne out by Mr Gulson's letter of 22 March 2006 from BGR to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (Exhibit F).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">In that, Mr Gulson said:
 
 'BGR has no business activities, apart from being a holding company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">Until 23 January 2006 (when it was sold) Main Camp Holdings owned the land known as Main Camp station and now has no business activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">Main Camp Corporation sold essential oils sourced from the Main Camp station in consequent upon the sale of the property, is winding down its business activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">

205 I am satisfied that by the time this letter was written, the activities of the defendant companies in the BGR group was of a very minor nature which did not justify the payment of consultancy fees at the level of $20,000 per month to Triad in the absence of agreement by Food Improvers and Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">Mr Gulson caused the consultancy fees to be paid to Triad in advance on at least two occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">Thus on 7 February 2006, following the sale of Main Camp plantation, consultancy fees for the three months February, March and April 2006 were paid to Triad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">On 21 March 2006 the consultancy fees for May 2006 were paid to Triad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">Thus $80,000 (exclusive of GST) had been paid to Triad for the four months ended May 2006 in respect of BGR's virtually non-existent business at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">I am not satisfied that there was any bona fide business reason why such payments should have been made in advance or why they should have been made and continued at the rate of $20,000 per month at a time when BGR group's business was, effectively, merely that of a holding company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">These payments, of course, were made without Mr Bax's or Food Improvers' consent and had the effect of running down the cash available for payment to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">PAYMENT OF ALL DEFENDANTS' LEGAL COSTS BY BGR 
 
206 It is common ground that throughout the whole of the litigation, all the legal costs and disbursements of the defendants have been paid by BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">These now amount to several hundred thousand dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">207 Mr Cordato caused his solicitor's firm, Cordato Partners, to invoice BGR in respect of work performed on behalf of BGR shareholders, Triad and Cordato Partners Services, in defending the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">Mr Cordato asserted that he had made an error in charging BGR for work done on behalf of his own company, Cordato Partners Services, because he kept no separate timesheets for that work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">I do not accept his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">It is clear from reviewing Mr Cordato's accounts, that he regarded BGR as the only source of payment of his company's (Cordato Partners Services) legal fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">Mr Gulson caused those accounts to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">Mr Gulson also asserted this was an error but I do not accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">Likewise BGR was billed for work performed in defending Triad's interests in the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">Mr Cordato again asserted this was a mistake and could be corrected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">I do not accept that he made a mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">208 Mr Cordato also charged BGR for drafting his own affidavit of 21 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">He had no record at all of any work which he performed for Cordato Partners Services which has not been charged to BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">His firm also charged BGR for attendances at Court on his company's behalf and for drafting his company's defences and affidavits sworn by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">209 An issue in the litigation involved the participation of Mr Cordato's firm as solicitors on the record for the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">Had Mr Cordato seen any distinction between his own personal interests and the personal interests of Mr Gulson, through their respective companies, from those of BGR, Mr Cordato would have kept proper timesheets and billed those matters separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">The fact that no separation was made and bills were rendered to and paid by BGR for work done, including, for example, Mr Cordato drafting Cordato Partners Services' defences, demonstrates that both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson were misusing their position as persons in control of BGR to have it fund their own defences of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">In contrast, both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson were aware that when Kemp Strang acted in late 2005, their fee notes, were addressed to Triad and not BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">Nonetheless, after Kemp Strang ceased to act, BGR paid Kemp Strang's fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">Mr Gulson's rationalisation for this was that it was appropriate that BGR pay the fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">When Mr Gulson requested him to act Mr Cordato said that there was a potential conflict of interest were he to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">Mr Gulson said that Allens Arthur Robinson had considered the issue of conflict as between the BGR group companies when they took instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">Subsequently, he gave Mr Cordato a copy of that firm's letter of 20 July 2005 in which they said that they acted for BGR and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">Allens Arthur Robinson did not claim to act for Triad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">Mr Cordato made a note on the copy letter that the interests of the majority shareholders: 
 
 '... may go beyond the discrete interests of BGR; eg 
 i/ 1/7 ratification --- a S/H [shareholder] matter could be oppressive 
 ii/ expenditure of funds on issues other than to resist payment of consultancy fees' (Ex S).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">

210 Despite adverting to these matters, Mr Cordato began to act for all the defendants and continued to do so, charging only BGR for work which no reasonable solicitor in his position could have considered to be for BGR's benefit, such as the examples I have given above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">
 CREDIBILITY ISSUES 
 
211 Mr Gulson is not a witness whose evidence I would accept unless it were corroborated independently on any matter on which there is an issue between him and other witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">I have given a number of instances above of circumstances in which Mr Gulson appeared to me to be deliberately misleading or unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">Whether this is a symptom of some unresolved psychiatric condition or whether it is a symptom of Mr Gulson's attempt to look after his own financial interests, it leads me to the conclusion that his evidence was generally unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">Mr Gulson sought to say what he believed would suit his own interests in the proceedings and to justify his own position, in the manner of an advocate, rather than a rencounter of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">His demeanour and manner changed from time to time in the witness box in the sense that at times he appeared to be extremely alert and focused while at others he was quite detached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">At times he was not prepared to make ready concessions of obvious matters, some of which I have set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">An example of the detached air which he had in answering questions, although difficult to identify in transcript as opposed to observation (which I accept is a less than satisfactory general guide to a witness's truthfulness) is the following evidence he gave concerning Mr Gobert:
 
 'And of course, you don't deny that you were having the opportunity of meeting the Biomor people that weekend, because of the efforts of Jim Gobert, do you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">--- Oh, look, this is - we're a corporation, you know?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">This is not about what one person does, and one person doesn't do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">It's a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">The corporation lives on, regardless of whether Jim's there in control of sales and marketing, or whether I'm there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">I'm really sorry, but, you know, there's no specialties here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">' (emphasis added)
 

212 Given the partnership relationship which Mr Gulson had with Mr Bax at this time the way in which he expressed himself in relation to the 'corporation' living on struck me at the time he said it as having an unusually detached quality about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">While in a manner of strict legal theory, and I appreciate Mr Gulson has legal training, what he said was correct, the comment was made during the course of cross-examination dealing with his very personal interaction with Mr Gobert on 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">213 Mr Cordato was also a witness who, unfortunately, I found unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">He had a material financial interest in the litigation through his beneficial holding in Cordato Partners Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">He was also, from the outset of the dispute, likely to be a material witness as to disputed issues of fact in relation to conversation he had had with Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and later Mr Lombardo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">He agreed that when he swore his affidavit of 8 May 2006 he realised both he and Mr Bax were directly in conflict in respective of various conversations in which they were both participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">Nonetheless, having accepted that he was an experienced solicitor in commercial litigation, he proceeded to draft not only his own affidavit in relation to those conversations but also Mr Gulson's affidavit in relation to the same conversations in which all three were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">Mr Cordato certified compliance of those affidavits under O 14 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">And, he acted as the defendants' solicitor on the record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">214 When his attention was drawn to r 19 of the Solicitors Rules made under the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) he sought to ascribe to that rule a construction which I am unable to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">The rule provides:
 
 'A practitioner must not appear as an advocate and, unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the practitioner's continuing retainer by the practitioner's client, the practitioner must not act, or continue to act, in a case in which it is known, or becomes apparent, that the practitioner will be required to give evidence material to the determination of contested issues before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">' 

Mr Cordato gave this evidence:

 
 The fourth proposition, Mr Cordato, that a solicitor cannot provide objectively independent assistance to the court where he or she is required to justify or defend his or her conduct in representing the client, even if he or she doesn't have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the hearing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">--- I wouldn't put it in such strong language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">
 
 How would you put it - sorry?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">--- There is a solicitors practice rule which I've - which I read a while ago so I can't be quoted on it, but to the effect that when a solicitor is to be - to give evidence in litigation they should not be conducting the matter, and I think - they shouldn't be personally conducting the matter, they are entitled to have someone in their office to do so, so I believe that what you're getting at here is, "justify defend his conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">" The way I read it is that I'm required to give evidence in these proceedings, so reading it that way I should not be objectively - purporting to give assistance to the client or to the court by --- I should not be the solicitor actually conducting the proceedings if I'm to be independent in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">
 
 But you don't - you don't say, do you, Mr Cordato, that you aren't intimately involved in the conduct of these proceedings, do you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">--- I supervise the conduct of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">I wouldn't say I'm intimately involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">
 
 You draft - you draft or settle the pleadings in the proceedings, don't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">--- I have settled the defences, yes, but I haven't drafted them of - entirely of my own accord and I've had instructions on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">
 
 You've drafted, for example, your own affidavit in the - your own affidavits in the proceedings, haven't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">--- I have drafted my affidavits and another - probably two others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">
 
 Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">You've in fact helped draft Mr Gulson's affidavits in the proceedings, haven't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">--- Yes, I have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">
 
 You're a witness of fact in the proceedings and you've drafted your own affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">You will agree with that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">--- Yes, I have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">
 
 You're a witness of fact in the proceedings and you've drafted Mr Gulson's affidavits who's also a witness in the proceedings?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">--- Yes, I have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">
 
 You are witnesses on material matters in these proceedings, aren't you - sorry, I withdraw that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">You are a witness about material matters in these proceedings, aren't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">

215 Later in his evidence he sought to explain that he was able to comply with r 19 by having a solicitor employed by his firm, Ms Cook, conduct the file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">However, he had drafted pleadings and a number of affidavits in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">He said:
 
 'So, I say that one reading, and the reading that is suggested to me, is that I am not appearing as an advocate and I would have to be appearing as an advocate were I to be in breach of r 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">It seems to suggest both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">But the way I have read the Rules is that provided one does not --- one has an instructing solicitor, which I have, and doesn't take any part in instructions in the Court proceedings, then it is permissible to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">' 

216 He asserted that provided that Ms Cook had the day to day conduct of the file, then his firm could continue to act and he could continue to act as solicitor on the record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">I am unable to understand how Mr Cordato rationalised his conduct in accordance with r 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">I am prepared to accept that he considered the rule and gave it a construction under which he could continue to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">I do not think that Mr Cordato was setting out deliberately to breach r 19 but I cannot see any reasonable basis for his interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">The rule in terms prohibits not just appearance as an advocate, but also acting as solicitor, in the same situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">217 By the time he had drafted his affidavit of 8 May 2006, it was obvious to him, as he said, that he would have to give evidence material to the determination of contested issues of fact before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">These were in relation to disputed conversations with Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">And he agreed that this material issue affected him, through his beneficial interest in Cordato Partners Services, in a significant financial way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">He also knew that his integrity was in issue in the sense that he and Mr Bax gave different versions of conversations, including that of 22 September 2005 in the meeting with Mr Lombardo and Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">When he was asked why on 8 May 2006, when he swore his substantive affidavit which responded to Mr Bax's and made clear this conflict of evidence, he made the decision to continue acting not just for his own company but for all the defendants in the proceedings he responded:
 
 'I didn't make the decision to do anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">I just continued to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">
 
 Why didn't you make the decision then knowing that your integrity was an issue, why didn't you then make the decision to stop acting for any of the [defendants] in the proceedings?....</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">I didn't think about it at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">' 

218 I am inclined to accept Mr Cordato's statement that he did not think about his position at the time, unsatisfactory as this was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">Mr Cordato ignored the obvious problem unthinkingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">His continued participation in the proceedings as solicitor on the record and actively drafting affidavits and defences for himself and Mr Gulson was the result of his misconstruction of r 19, his determination to continue to act and obtuseness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">I do not think that Mr Cordato made a dishonest misconstruction of r 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">Rather, he was wilfully blind in the view that he took of the rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">The requirement of rule 19 was that Mr Cordato could not continue to act when he knew, as he did on 8 May 2006, that he would be required to give evidence material to the determination of contested issues between himself, Mr Gulson and Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">Rule 19 is pellucidly clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">219 I have been quite concerned about Mr Cordato's evidence because it must be assessed in light of the fact that the plaintiffs had sought orders enjoining him from acting and had put on a motion at the time his affidavit of 8 May 2006 was being prepared seeking to have that issue resolved immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">Written submissions were prepared by the plaintiffs and served on Mr Cordato's firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">He said that he did not read them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">Again, that is an answer which has caused me difficulty, but I think it is consistent with the above attitude Mr Cordato adopted to his own position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">WAS MR BAX'S REACTION TO THE EVENTS OF 29 MAY 2005 A RUSE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">
 
220 The defendants sought to suggest that Mr Bax wanted a basis to leave BGR because it was in dire financial straits and that he seized on the behaviour of Mr Gulson in dismissing Mr Gobert for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">The argument seems to have been based on a suggestion that the business had a facility limit with Elders of $1,080,000 which had been temporarily extended to $1,380,000 until 31 August 2005 and which Mr Bax must have appreciated could not be repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">221 Mr Bax pointed out the group also had a Commonwealth Bank account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">No financial analysis or expert evidence was tendered to support the defendants' suggestion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">Mr Bax could simply have asked Mr Gulson to dissolve their partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">No advantage was suggested to Mr Bax in cross-examination or submissions, for Mr Bax to have staged his departure in the way it occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">No reason was suggested by the defendants why Mr Bax would want to provoke litigation in which Mr Gulson had, and he did not have, access to the group's funds in circumstances where Mr Gulson had the majority shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">222 The group had substantial net assets, as was shown by the fact that over $6,000,000 was available for distribution after payment of creditors from the sale of Main Camp about six months later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">Mr Bax had given personal guarantees to finance companies for some of the group's liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">Abandoning his position would mean that he could be exposed to those creditors, if there were default under their facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">223 The defendants (other than Cordato Partners Services) also denied in their pleaded defence that Mr Gulson acted abusively on 29 May 2005 in the Renaissance Hotel and that he had terminated Mr Gobert's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">Moreover, they pleaded that the plaintiff's allegations 'were made as a ruse to deflect responsibility for the refusal by Jim Gobert and John Bax to continue with the travel arrangements made to visit customers and potential customers ...' (Defence [43]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">Mr Gulson verified that defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">For the reasons I have given this defence had no substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">In their final submissions the defendants abandoned the pleaded allegation of a ruse, no doubt because it was unsustainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">Yet they persisted with a contention that Mr Gulson had no option but to terminate Mr Bax's consultancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">That ignored what Mr Cordato had suggested to both Mr Bax and Mr Gulson in his email of 30 May 2005 that it '... would be obviously beneficial (probably vital) if [Mr Bax and Mr Gobert] remained pending the sale' of the business, in light of the breakdown in relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1266">224 I find that Mr Bax did not engineer his own departure from the group and that he was genuine in his spontaneous reaction to what Mr Gulson did in sacking Mr Gobert on 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1267">I am of opinion that the defendants' contention is baseless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1268">225 Mr Gulson asserted that Mr Bax had a discussion with him in early 2005 as they were discussing the fit out of BGR's new offices, which were to be located next to Cordato Partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1269">Mr Gulson said that Mr Bax said he was thinking of winding down his involvement in the business later in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1270">I accept Mr Bax's denial of that assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1271">226 The defendants also asserted that after Mr Gobert's sacking became known to Main Group's customers, he and Mr Bax orchestrated a campaign against to undermine Mr Gulson and to set up their own commercial opportunities with those customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1272">Mr Lawson, the Biomor representatives and Murray Hunter, managing director of Perlis Essential Oils of Malaysia all wrote to Mr Bax expressing appreciation of him and Mr Gobert and either distancing themselves from, or complaining of, Mr Gulson's inappropriate behaviour in his dealings with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1273">I do not consider that this evidences any disentitling or wrongful conduct by Mr Bax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1274">He had seen Mr Gulson's behaviour and actions on the night of 29 May 2005 as destroying their partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1275">Friends and contacts which he and Mr Gobert had made over the years were entitled to get their side of the story and to express their own views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1276">The defendants sought to place this in the context of an argument that Mr Bax 'abdicated his responsibilities in London' and for the rest of the planned trip by refusing to participate after 29 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1277">This argument has no substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1278">Mr Gulson had shown he was impossible to work with at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1279">The medical and factual evidence to which I have referred above makes plain how ill he was and how that affected his ability to relate to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1280">227 Mr Gulson's behaviour on the night of the 29 May 2005 was seen by Mr Bax as destructive of their partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1281">That view was honest and reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1282">The defendants' submission in effect, required Mr Bax to ignore Mr Gulson's unilateral sacking of Mr Gobert and to acquiesce in a 'business as usual' stance when what Mr Gulson was doing was very unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1283">STATUTORY BASES FOR THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS 
 
228 The Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to relief on the bases provided under ss 232 or 461 (1)(k) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1284">The basis of the claim under s 232 is that the conduct of BGR's affairs was either contrary to the interests of the members as a whole or oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or, unfairly discriminatory against, Food Improvers whether in its capacity as a member or any other capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1285">In considering what a company's affairs are, s 53 of the Act provides a very wide, but not exhaustive, definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1286">Thus, the promotion, formation, membership and control of BGR are relevant, as is its internal management its share ownership and the power of persons to exercise or to control the exercise of rights to vote attached its shares (s 53(a) , (c), (e) and (f)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1287">229 The Court has considerable powers to make orders designed to remedy a situation in which a plaintiff is able to establish the grounds provided under s 232.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1288">Thus s 233 enables the Court to make an order that the company be wound up, or if that is not appropriate to appoint a receiver or a receiver or manager of any or all of its property, regulate the conduct of its affairs in the future, order the purchase of shares or order a person to do a specified act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1289">230 The second statutory basis upon which the plaintiffs claim relief is an order under s 461(1)(k).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1290">That provides that the Court may order the winding up of BGR if it is of opinion that it is just and equitable to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1291">Where an application is made by a member in the position of Food Improvers as a contributory (because of its position as a shareholder) on the just and equitable ground, the Court is obliged to make the order for winding up if it is of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to that relief and in the absence of any other remedy it would be just and equitable to do so, unless there is some other remedy available to the plaintiffs and that they are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the winding up order made instead of pursuing that other remedy (s 467(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1292">The defendants have not suggested that, in the event that the plaintiffs are able to prove their case, they are acting unreasonably in seeking have BGR wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1293">However the plaintiffs have applied, under s 233(h) for a receiver to be appointed to BGR as a preferred alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1294">PRINCIPLES OF LAW 
 
231 In the decision to establish the business of the BGR group in mid-1999, each of Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece envisaged that they would operate together, through the corporate vehicle of BGR, as a quasi or actual partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1295">As I have found, that is how the three men proceeded until Mr Reece's departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1296">Thereafter, Mr Bax and Mr Gulson operated as partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1297">Mr Cordato's role was confined to that of an external lawyer and a silent investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1298">232 The remedies provided for oppression and the winding up on the just and equitable ground which the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and its predecessors have for many years provided are distinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">But, considerations relevant to each remedy can overlap because s 232(a) identifies the conduct of the company's affairs as being a relevant criterion for the ascertainment of whether what is complained of is either contrary to the interests of the members as a whole or oppressive within the meaning of s 232(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">The Court is invited to enquire into what the relationship between the members was in much the same way as it is required to assess their relationship for the purposes of determining whether it is just and equitable to wind the company up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">233 In his seminal speech in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 at 380B Lord Wilberforce pointed out that a company however small and however domestic is a company and not a partnership or even a quasi partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1302">He said, however, that it was through the just and equitable clause (now s 461(1)(k)) that obligations, common to partnership relations, may come in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">He continued by pointing out that the just and equitable ground is available if the member can point to and prove some special underlying obligation of his fellow member or members in good faith, or confidence, that so long as the business continues he shall be entitled to management participation, an obligation so basic that, if broken, the conclusion must be that the association must be dissolved ( Ebrahimi [1973] AC at 380E).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">234 Lord Wilberforce said that the principles on which the member may do this had been worked out by the Courts in partnership situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">Earlier in his speech, he pointed out that the just and equitable ground enables the Court to subject the exercise of legal rights to equitable considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">He said that these considerations were of a personal character between one individual and another which may make it unjust or inequitable, to insist on legal rights or to exercise them in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">Lord Wilberforce said that it would be impossible and wholly undesirable to define the circumstances in which those considerations may arise and pointed to the fact that merely because a company was a small one or a private company was not enough to bring those into play.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">235 If the association were purely a commercial one in which it could safely be said that the basis of the association was adequately and exhaustively laid down in the company's constitution, equitable considerations need have no part ( Ebrahimi [1973] AC at 379 C-E).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">But, his Lordship pointed out that: ( Ebrahimi [1973] AC at 379 E-H)
 
 'The superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more, which typically may include one, or probably more, of the following elements: (i) an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual confidence - this element will often be found where a pre-existing partnership has been converted into a limited company; (ii) an agreement, or understanding, that all, or some (for there may be 'sleeping' members), of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business; (iii) restriction upon the transfer of the members' interest in the company - so that if confidence is lost, or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">
 It is these, and analogous, factors which may bring into play the just and equitable clause, and they do so directly, through the force of the words themselves.</sentence>

236 Conduct which is burdensome, harsh and wrongful is oppressive: Scottish Meyer Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer [1959] AC 324 at 342.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">Such conduct is capable of being unfairly prejudicial to a member within the meaning of s 232(e): Dynasty Pty Ltd v Coombs (1995) 59 FCR 122 at 135D per Spender, O'Loughlin and Branson JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1313">Their Honours went on to apply what Lord Wilberforce said in Ebrahami [1973] AC at 379 which I have set out above on the question of the existence of quasi partnership ( Dynasty 59 FCR at 138 B-D).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1314">They took the view the act of removing a quasi partner as a director could be significant evidence of oppression ( Dynasty 59 FCR at 138 E-F; see also Smith Martis Cork &amp; Rajan Pty Ltd v Benjamin Corporation Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 136 at 149-150 [105]-[107] per Wilcox, Marshall and Jacobson JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1315">237 In In re A Company [1999] UKHL 24 ; [1999] 1 WLR 1092 at 1098D-1102B Lord Hoffmann discussed the interplay of the just and equitable concept in the analogue of s 461(1)(k) and 'unfair' in the analogue of s 232(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1316">He pointed out that although fairness was a notion that could be applied to all kinds of activities, its content would depend upon the context in which it was being used ( In re A Company [1999] 1 WLR at 1098F).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1317">Of course, there will be decisions in any association, such as a partnership or company, which one or more members find to be prejudicial or discriminatory against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1318">But the emphasis in establishing a ground for an order under s 232(e) is that the conduct be unfairly prejudicial or discriminatory or be oppressive ( Wayde v New South Wales Rugby League Ltd [1985] HCA 68 ; (1985) 180 CLR 459 at 467-468 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1319">Thus, the bona fide and proper exercise of a power under a company's constitution for the purpose for which it was conferred is unlikely to be found to establish unfair prejudice or unfair discrimination against a member under s 232(e) ( Wayde 180 CLR at 467).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1320">238 In Tay Bok Choon v Tahansan Sdn Bhd [1987] 1 WLR 413 at 417H-418A the Privy Council held that where a person has been led to believe, even in the absence of any express assurance, that he or she would participate in the management of a company, he or she would in any event be entitled to a seat on the board so long as he or she continued to hold his shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1321">Their Lordships said that although no specific undertakings may have been given, an obligation could be implied or inferred from the conduct of the parties to allow the person to participate in the management and to be a director '...unless by withdrawal of his support or for some other good reason a change in management and control became necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">' 
 
239 The defendants argued that Mr Bax withdrew his support and that it therefore became necessary to change management and control of BGR as occurred on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">The context of which their Lordships were speaking, in my opinion, was one in which the withdrawal of support by the director claiming a remedy under the just and equitable ground or for oppression occurred as a free and voluntary act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">Where the relationship between the parties breaks down, and the plaintiff is not at fault, the substratum of their mutual endeavour may be removed so as to make it appropriate to grant relief under ss 233 or 461 (1)(k).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">I do not understand their Lordships to suggest otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">A broad discretion is conferred by these provisions on the court to remedy instances in which relations break down among those who have combined to run a business through a corporate structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">This is necessary because of the wide variety of circumstances in which such disputes can arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">Courts have cautioned against the creation of hard and fast rules to govern the application of the broad discretionary remedies in the legislation (see Ebrahami [1973] AC at 374-375, applied by Gummow and Hayne JJ and Vigolo v Boston [2005] HCA 11 ; (2005) 221 CLR 191 at 217-218 [71] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">CONSIDERATION 
 
240 In May 2005 Mr Bax and Mr Gulson had been in a longstanding relationship of mutual trust and confidence in the management of BGR's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1330">They both recognised that Mr Gulson's company, Triad, held a substantial majority of voting power, but the substratum on which the two had acted over the preceding years was that each treated the other as a partner with an equal say in the management of BGR on business direction and, planning issues and Mr Bax was managing director, even though not formally appointed as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1331">They were both prepared to and did work for a substantial period for no guaranteed remuneration from March 2001, when large sums, representing consultancy fees, had been repaid and further payments suspended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1332">These factors demonstrated that neither man (or his corporate vehicle) was looking to strict legal rights under BGR's constitution as the sole source of the regulation of their relationship in the conduct of BGR's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1333">241 Mr Bax's plan, which had been agreed in 1999, was that each of the then three executives, and later two, would have equal say in the management of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1334">That was essential to the efforts being made by each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1335">And, the recognition in the consultancy agreements that each would be equally rewarded for their work was also a key feature in their relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1336">The equal reward for their work was, of course, distinct from the ultimately unequal distribution or burden which would occur when there was a need to resort to the use of shareholding to measure either benefit or obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1337">Thus, in early 2001, when each of the investors was called upon to make loans to BGR, they did so in accordance with their approximate proportionate shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1338">Likewise, when BGR came to pay dividends they would have anticipated that it would do so in accordance with shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1339">However, each investor in BGR was aware that the three executives had consultancy agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1340">Once payment of fess under those agreements ceased, or was made at a reduced rate, each investor could not have considered that the unpaid fees were foregone so as potentially to increase the ultimate amount available to be distributed as dividends at the unpaid executives' expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1341">The dividends were to come after the remuneration of each of the partners who had worked to generate such profits or assets as might be distributed by way of dividend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1342">It would be unfair having regard to the way in which BGR's affairs had been conducted since mid 1999 to distribute, in the absence of agreement to do so, a dividend among the members in proportion to shareholding where the three executives' companies had been left unremunerated or inadequately remunerated, according to the consultancy agreements they had made for remuneration, in the period in which what was being distributed as a dividend had been earned or gained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1343">242 On 29 May 2005 the personal relationship between Mr Bax and Mr Gulson deteriorated so that Mr Bax said he could no longer work with Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">Were they in partnership, it would be clear that the loss of mutual trust and confidence at that point would have meant that the partnership had been brought to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">I am satisfied that is just and equitable to order the winding up of BGR because of the destruction on 29 May 2005 of the mutual trust and confidence that occurred between Mr Bax and Mr Gulson, the latter being joined shortly afterwards by Mr Cordato when sides were taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">Mr Bax had given up his position as chief executive officer of the Ink Group in order to take on his position as managing director of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">For the next six years he managed BGR and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">But he was confronted on 29 May with Mr Gulson, regrettably mentally unwell, but also belligerently insisting on sacking Mr Gobert in the middle of their overseas trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">Mr Gulson's behaviour was such as would have undermined anyone's trust and confidence in his ability to cooperate in the running of the enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">243 I am satisfied that Mr Bax bona fide believed he could no longer work with Mr Gulson as a result of Mr Gulson's conduct and that Mr Bax acted honestly and reasonably in forming that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">Indeed, within two weeks Mr Gulson's wife was in a similar position, ultimately threatening to leave him with their children unless he admitted himself to hospital for treatment of his mental condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">His behaviour in this period was, regrettably, affected by his illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">That behaviour was destructive of the mutual trust and confidence he and Mr Bax had hitherto enjoyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">It involved the assertion of Mr Gulson's will and his attempt to dominate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">In addition, he assigned false reasons for calling the meeting of BGR on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">While Mr Cordato says he was not consulted, he made no attempt to deal with Mr Gulson about the falsity of those reasons of which he knew (such as the fact that Mr Gobert had not refused to participate further in the overseas trip but had been summarily dismissed by Mr Gulson on the night of 29 May 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">Moreover, Mr Cordato was well aware of Mr Gulson's deteriorating mental condition, but chose to do nothing about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">By saying that he took heed of what the majority shareholder thought he abdicated control to Mr Gulson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">244 Thereafter, both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson used their powers to direct BGR in such a way that Mr Bax was entirely excluded from his previous position as an equal partner in the business' direction and planning and managing director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">The circumstances in which BGR had been formed and run up to 29 May 2005 radically changed from that night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">Mr Gulson's decision to dismiss a critical employee in the middle of the overseas trip without any consultation and to persist in what was an untenable basis for his dismissal showed that he was no longer able to be dealt with by Mr Bax in the way that they had related to each other before this happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">Then, Mr Gulson chose to break the deadlock he had created on the board by the exercise of Triad's majority shareholder's powers to remove Mr Bax and to cancel Food Improvers' consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">245 I am of the opinion that conduct warrants the making of an order under s 461(1)(k) because it is just and equitable that BGR be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">246 However, it is necessary to consider whether some other remedy might be available of a less drastic kind under s 233 (see s 467(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">In Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 37 ACSR 672 at 687 [89]-[90] per Spigelman CJ, 772 [570]-[571] per Priestley JA and 792 [691] per Fitzgerald JA, the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the existence of irreconcilable differences among persons involved in what is, in effect, a partnership, conducted through a company, applies both to applications for winding up on the just and equitable ground and also to oppression suits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">Spigelman CJ pointed out ( Fexuto 37 ACSR at 687 [89] --- [90]), if the court decided the person excluded was the one responsible for the breakdown in the relationship, he or she would not be entitled to claim to have suffered oppression under s 232.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">That is not this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">Mr Bax's conduct was understandable and reactive to Mr Gulson's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">If fault is to be attributed in the breakdown of the relationship, it is to Mr Gulson for the way he behaved in the Heathrow Hotel and afterwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">That conduct was destructive of and confirmatory of the destruction of the previous relationship of mutual trust and confidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">Mr Cordato later came to participate in association with Mr Gulson in that destructiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">247 As Priestley JA said in Fexuto 37 ACSR at 772 [571], putting in quasi partnership terms what happened from 29 May 2005, the majority shareholder and director changed the previous management regime against the opposition of the minority director and shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">He held that this entitled the minority to a remedy and that in ordinary partnership situations the remedy was dissolution of the partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">Priestley JA pointed out that the remedy available under the analogue of ss 232 and 233 was broader than simply a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">He had found that oppression in that case had occurred by a change in the previous way in which the business had been conducted, where all the partners or directors jointly engaged in direct management of the company ( Fexuto 37 ACSR at 772 [569]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">248 Even if oppression of, or unfair prejudice or unfair discrimination against Food Improvers (either as a member of BGR or the partnership or as the provider of Mr Bax's services under the consultancy agreement) were not established solely by what occurred on the evening of 29 May 2005, Mr Gulson's later determination to use his voting power to exclude, first, Mr Bax as a director of BGR and, secondly, Food Improvers from the benefits of both his directorship and the consultancy agreement on the knowingly false basis upon which it was asserted that Mr Gobert's contact should be terminated or its termination affirmed, was oppressive of, unfairly prejudicial and unfairly discriminatory against Mr Bax and Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">When Mr Cordato sided with Mr Gulson and they both voted in favour of the resolutions on 1 July 2005, the oppression of Food Improvers was manifest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">249 Mr Bax was excluded from any management role in BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">Mr Gulson commenced to pay Triad an increased consultancy fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">He and Mr Cordato initially consulted with Mr Bax about the sale of Main Camp plantation, but later negotiated the sale without Mr Bax's involvement and refused to inform him of the details of its terms apart from the price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">250 Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato used their majority powers to have BGR pay for all of the legal fees involved in Triad's and Cordato Partners Services' defence of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">They caused Cordato Partners to receive not only its fees for this work but also substantial fees for previously unbilled work once the proceeds of sale of Main Camp were received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">There was no basis on which the expenditure of BGR's funds for the defence by Triad and Cordato Partners Services of these proceedings could be seen as being in the best interests of the members as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">It was plain to Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson that the relationship with Mr Bax had broken down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">The resistance to the making of an order under s 461(1)(k) or s 233 for winding up BGR appears to have been initially based on an assertion that Mr Gobert had resigned and that he and Mr Bax had refused to participate further in the planned activities on the trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">That assertion was unsustainable because it was false to Mr Gulson's and Mr Cordato's knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">They also sought to argue, without justification, that Mr Bax was not entitled to be the managing director of BGR, he could be removed as a director and Food Improvers' consultancy could be terminated for the false reasons put forward in the notice of the 1 July 2005 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">251 Next it was asserted that Mr Bax had voluntarily sought to bring the relationship to an end so that Mr Gulson was merely formalising matters on 1 July 2005 by forcing through his resolutions at the meeting of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">Given that both he and Mr Cordato were well aware of his mental illness and the impact that that illness was having on Mr Gulson's relationships, the failure, at least, to pause and reflect that Mr Bax had a legitimate reason for not being able to continue to work with Mr Gulson resulted in a persistence by Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson in pursuing this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">252 Although he had been promised, as had been his right as a quasi partner, the right to be informed and consulted in the sale process, Mr Bax was excluded from discussions about or negotiations for the ultimate purchase of Main Camp plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">For months the plaintiffs were told that a distribution would be made in accordance with option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">Instead, they were confronted with a fait accompli when a different form of distribution was made without any further consultation in February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">253 Moreover, hundreds of thousands of dollars of BGR's funds have been spent in the defence of these proceedings so that Mr Gulson's and Mr Cordato's companies, Triad and Cordato Partners Services can resist orders being made that affect them in their personal capacity as shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">The expenditure of BGR's money in their defence of these proceedings was unjustifiable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">There will be cases where a trustee or fiduciary is entitled to spend trust money in the defence of an attack of upon his or her own conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">But the present case does not warrant since a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">I have found a number of instances in which each of Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson has acted in the management or conduct of BGR's affairs in his or their own interests rather than those of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">And in some of those instances I did not accept their evidence or have positively disbelieved it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">254 Moreover, Mr Cordato acted in these proceedings as solicitor for all the defendants in circumstances where no reasonable solicitor in his position could possibly have acted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">He was precluded by the application of r 19 of the Solicitors Rules from acting, certainly by no later than 8 May 2006, but probably considerably earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">But in any event, Mr Cordato's financial interest in the success of the defendants' case meant that he was unable to act with the independence which a solicitor on the record must have as part of the relationship between an officer of the court and the court in the presentation and conduct of litigation: Kallinicos v Hunt [2005] NSWSC 1181 ; (2005) 64 NSWLR 561 at 512 [76] , 584-585 [86], 586 [91] per Brereton J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">As Brereton J said, a solicitor should not act where a fair minded and reasonable observer would think that his or her independence and objectivity as a solicitor would be compromised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">The scrutiny which the solicitor's conduct would attract in litigation, his or her knowledge of the instructions in relation to the subject matter in which he or she might be a material witness are relevant factors in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">( Kallinicos 64 NSWLR at 586 [91]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">Mr Cordato was a material witness on important conversations; he charged BGR for the personal costs for which Triad and Cordato Partners Services were liable and he continued to act oblivious of the motion to enjoin him from doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">He prepared Mr Gulson's affidavits including those parts dealing with disputed conversations, such as with Mr Lombardo, to which both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson were party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">That conduct put him in an impossible position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">However much, by his own lights, he may have tried to put Mr Gulson's account objectively and uninfluenced by Mr Cordato's own recollection he could not do so in the way a person who was independent could have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">And, of course, Mr Cordato's account is likely, even if only subconsciously, to have been influenced by what he had learned in taking Mr Gulson's affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">255 The distribution in February 2006 did not recognise the need to make any payment to Mr Bax and Food Improvers for the work that he had been done during the periods in which consultancy fees had been refunded and later when they were either left unpaid or paid at a reduced rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">This was unfair prejudice to Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">Mr Cordato's legal firm was permitted by Mr Gulson to bill and be paid in January 2006 for all its unbilled work in progress throughout BGR's existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">Yet, Mr Cordato was not even working in the business of BGR to generate the asset that was ultimately realised on the sale of the Main Camp plantation business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">256 The affairs of BGR have been taken over by Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson and run in a way which favours their companies' interests and disadvantages Mr Bax's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">Mr Cordato made no attempt to dissect from the fees he rendered to BGR those which were referable wholly to his own personal and his company's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">Nor did he attempt to do so in respect of the personal interests of Mr Gulson and Triad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">Instead, both Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson, deliberately, decided to use BGR's money to pay for the whole of the defence costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">I do not believe their evidence to the effect that the expenditure for the personal purposes of Mr Cordato or Cordato Partners Services was unintended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">Mr Cordato kept no records to enable separate fees to be rendered because he did not need to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">He considered he was entitled to use BGR's money to defend his own personal and his company's interests including his reputation, so far as it was attacked in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">Mr Gulson had no reason to disapprove of Mr Cordato's fees being paid by BGR because Triad's fees were too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">Likewise, Mr Gulson saw his interests as being those of BGR, which is why he caused the fees that Kemp Strang had rendered to Triad to be paid by BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">Mr Cordato's lack of independence was one contributing factor which permitted that to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">257 These have been hard fought and expensive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">Mr Cordato and Mr Gulson continued to pay not only all of the defendants' legal costs using BGR's resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">They knew Mr Bax had to fund his own case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">Triad continued to be paid $20,000 per month after February 2006, sometimes in advance, even though the work Mr Gulson has done in that period does not merit any payment of this order, as his letter of 22 March 2006 to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission makes clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">258 In Re DG Brims &amp; Sons Pty Limited (1995) 16 ACSR 559 at 591-592, Byrne J in the Supreme Court of Queensland said the use of company funds in defending the proceedings on behalf of the majority shareholders was unfair and infringed the basal principle that the powers and the funds of a company may be used only for the purposes of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">He said that where the essential dispute was between the shareholders, company funds should not have been used to defend the majority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">Here, the essential dispute was between the shareholders and the funds of BGR should not have been employed to pay for a defence of the majority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">259 For all these reasons, I am of opinion that the conduct of BGR's affairs is contrary to the interests of its members as a whole and is oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">RELIEF AGAINST MR CORDATO AND CORDATO PARTNERS PERSONALLY 
 
260 The plaintiffs filed a motion on 31 March 2006 which sought, among other things, an order restraining Cordato Partners from acting for any of BGR and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">It was not sought to restrain Cordato Partners from acting on behalf of Triad or Cordato Partners Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">The hearing of that motion was concurrent with the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">Cordato Partners is not a party to the proceedings, and was not made a party to the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">No relief is sought in the third further amended application or the further amended statement of claim against Cordato Partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">261 As I have found, it was inappropriate for Mr Cordato to act in the proceedings or to continue acting, particularly after he swore his affidavit of 8 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">The motion and the submissions made in support of it were served on him prior to his swearing that affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">He said that he chose not to read the submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">I find that behaviour on his part, if it is true, to be extraordinary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">A solicitor who is aware another party to proceedings seeks personally to enjoin him or her from acting in the proceedings cannot reasonably refuse to turn his or her mind to why that argument was being made, even if the person making it were perceived to be vexatious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">Where the solicitor's integrity could be called into question as an officer of the court, were the relief granted, it would ordinarily be incumbent on his or her to familiarise himself or herself with the reasons why the person sought to have him or her cease to act or attack his or her integrity in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">And, once that familiarisation had occurred, it would be necessary for the solicitor to turn his or her mind to the question of whether there was substance in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">If so, he or she ought to obtain independent advice on it, if he or she thought the application could be resisted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">262 Mr Cordato's insouciance to the application made against him was professionally unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">It was an abnegation of his obligation to the Court to act independently as the solicitor on the record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">Difficult as it is to believe that he did not read the submissions, I have concluded that I should not reject his explanation because it is consistent with his wrongheaded behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">He chose, wrongly, to ignore the obvious problem, no doubt taking comfort in his misconstruction of r 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">263 After the hearing had concluded both sides and Mr Cordato made written submissions on the question of Mr Cordato's continuing to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">The plaintiffs apparently had insisted that counsel who appeared at the trial for the defendants be not permitted to make those submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">Senior counsel was retained to make submissions on behalf of Mr Cordato and his firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">Senior counsel submitted that the attempt to remove Mr Cordato as solicitor for the defendants was made too late, was without substance and was inconsistent with the position taken by Haywards in their letter of 15 May 2006 that Mr Cordato's continuing to act was further evidence of oppression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">Senior counsel pointed to Brereton J's statement in Kallinicos 64 NSWLR at 582 [76] that the jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">264 The fact that the plaintiffs only then insisted on someone other than those who had appeared hitherto in making these submissions, although the basis of such insistence is not clear to me, demonstrated a belated realisation on the plaintiffs' part of the inappropriateness of their motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">It was directed to restraining Cordato Partners, as opposed to restraining the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">Cordato Partners was not a party to the proceedings or to the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">That firm had not been served formally and it was not separately represented at the hearing or on any other occasion save for the submissions made by senior counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">Mr Cordato gave evidence as a witness, and as the controlling mind of Cordato Partners Services, the third defendant, but not as a party to the proceedings personally; nor did he appear for Cordato Partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">Had the motion sought to restrain the relevant defendants from engaging Cordato Partners, it may have been possible to hear and determine it, although, as a person affected by the order, Cordato Partners should have been joined and they could have applied to be joined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">265 I am not satisfied that the proceedings have been conducted appropriately as a vehicle for determining in the inherent jurisdiction of the court the disqualification of Cordato Partners from acting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">I have expressed views about the inappropriateness of Mr Cordato's conduct, but having regard to the way in which the matter developed and the very late realisation by both sides as to the need for independent representation of Cordato Partners, I do not think it appropriate at this stage to make any orders against the firm or its principal Mr Cordato.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">For the reasons I have given it is inappropriate for Mr Cordato and his firm to continue to act for the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">That being so, I do not think it necessary for me to do anything further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">RELIEF CLAIMED 
 
266 In the third further amended application the plaintiffs sought:
 
 
 (a) declarations pursuant to s 232 that the following conduct is or was contrary to the interests of the members as of BGR as a whole or is oppressive to or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against Food Improvers: 
 

&#8226; the conduct of the affairs of BGR;
 
&#8226; the resolutions passed at the meeting of 1 July 2005;
 
&#8226; the use of BGR's funds to pay the costs referable to the defence of the interests of Triad and Cordato Partners Services; and
 
&#8226; the use of BGR's funds to pay Triad's $20,000 monthly consultancy fees from when BGR had no national business activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">
 
 (b) an order under s 233 that Triad and/or Cordato Partners Services purchase the shares of Food Improvers in BGR or that BGR purchase those shares; 
 (c) orders under s 233 or s 461(1)(k) that BGR and its defendant subsidiaries be wound up and a liquidator appointed;
 (d) alternatively, orders appointing a receiver or independent accountant to sell the assets of BGR and its defendant subsidiaries and distribute the proceeds to creditors and shareholders;
 (e) alternatively, an order appointing an expert to value the shares in BGR;
 (f) orders for payment to Food Improvers of $1,165,777.73 plus GST for consultancy fees to 1 July 2005, together with interest on its loan of $111,000 and three months consultancy fees in lieu of notice following on termination of the consultancy agreement;
 (g) damages and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">
 

267 In the plaintiffs' written submissions handed up on the last afternoon of the trial they sought some additional, unpleaded, relief, namely:
 
&#8226; an order for specific performance of an agreement to distribute in accordance with option B;
 
&#8226; orders that the distribution which was actually made in February 2006 either be repaid by Triad and Cordato Partners Services or be treated in such a way as to ensure that a distribution of the money then paid be made in accordance with option B; 
 
&#8226; an order that Triad and Cordato Partners Services repay to the other defendants 95% of all legal costs and disbursements paid by BGR or its subsidiaries in respect of these proceedings and that Triad repay 90% of all consultancy fees received by it since 1 July 2005; 
 
&#8226; the appointment of a receiver under s 233(1)(h) having all the powers of a court appointed receiver under s 420 of the Act for the purpose of selling the remaining assets of BGR and its defendant subsidiaries ascertaining and paying their creditors, determining whether the BARM litigation should be continued and to make distributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">WHAT ORDERS SHOULD BE MADE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">
 
268 For the reasons I have given, I am of opinion that I should make declarations to the effect sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">269 An order for specific performance of an agreement to distribute in accordance with option B is not appropriate because no contact so to distribute was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">But it is not the end of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">Both Triad and Food Improvers are entitled to render invoices so as to be paid over $1 million each in consultancy fees which had not been invoiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">Food Improvers has established that it is entitled to receive interest from BGR on its loan of $111,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">The plaintiffs' position is that they wish Food Improvers to receive only $500,000 by way of a payment for the consultancy fees forgone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">Likewise, Mr Gulson has indicated that he and Triad do not wish to receive any consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">As the difference between options A and B showed, Triad was fiscally better off by receiving only dividends which would be fully franked together with the corresponding imputation credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">And, Mr Lombardo gave advice that that was best for both Triad's and Food Improvers' positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">270 The negotiations in September 2005 and all the correspondence up to the time of the distribution on 22 February 2006 demonstrated that all the shareholders were content to have a payment of $500,000 made in respect of Food Improvers' entitlement to consultancy fees and thereafter a distribution made in accordance with the balance of option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">Having regard to the oppression which I have found in respect of the way Food Improvers has been treated, I am of opinion that it would be appropriate to make an order requiring BGR, Triad and Cordato Partners Services to cause the payment of a tax invoice for $500,000 plus GST, when issued by Food Improvers, in respect of the compromise of its entitlement to consultancy fees payable by BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">Although the plaintiffs have also claimed that Food Improvers, should receive three months consultancy fees in lieu of notice for the wrongful termination of the consultancy agreement, I am of opinion that Mr Bax's and Food Improvers' conduct in September 2005 and thereafter in offering to accept payment of $500,000 plus GST for those fees under option B makes it appropriate that only that sum be ordered to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">The $500,000 was a compromise figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">Had it been paid, each party would have considered that to have finalised all of Food Improvers' entitlements to fees under the consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">271 The dividend paid on 22 February 2006 should be set aside and BGR should be required to give effect to a distribution in accordance with the mechanism in option B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">That is, the $500,000 consultancy fee plus GST should be paid to Food Improvers by BGR and then a dividend paid to its shareholders which would be used to repay their loan accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">The amounts so received by BGR would then fund a second dividend to its shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">It may be possible for the parties to agree some payments between them of net amounts instead of this, in light of the fact that the earlier payments have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">Food Improvers will also be entitled to have the dividends paid to it by BGR treated as fully franked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">272 I am of opinion that an order should be made that a substantial proportion of the legal fees paid for the defendants' conduct of the proceedings should be borne by the second and third defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">I propose to hear the parties as to the appropriate form of that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">I will give the defendants an opportunity to make submissions as to whether the proportions should be 95% or a lesser sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">I should indicate that my preliminary view is that in the order of 90% of the fees payable up to the 31 July 2005 might properly be borne by BGR and that thereafter the substantial part of the proceedings appears to have been conducted for the benefit and defence of the positions of Triad and Cordato Partners Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">Although they contend that the defence of the claim to consultancy fees was for the benefit of BGR, I am of opinion that the dominant purpose of that defence was to benefit Triad and Cordato Partners Services at the expense of Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">In addition I have found that Mr Gulson did not believe that the entitlement to claim consultancy fees had ever been cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">In those circumstances the persistence in the defence was oppressive of Food Improvers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">273 In relation to the consultancy fees paid to Triad after July 2005, I find that Mr Gulson did perform some substantial work in the management of BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">Mr Gulson's decision to sell on the terms on which Main Camp plantation was sold has not been challenged, so that it is accepted that his work achieved a considerable benefit for all the shareholders, albeit, by excluding Mr Bax from the decision making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">I can see no justification for Triad's consultancy fees at the rate of $20,000 per month having been established on the evidence after 28 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">In my opinion it is oppressive of Food Improvers for Triad to continue to be paid at that rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">Given that Mr Gulson was performing work up to then I am inclined to the view that Triad should be remunerated at the rate agreed between him and Mr Bax before Mr Bax's exclusion, that is $16,000 per month plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">Accordingly, an order should be made that Triad should repay the amounts exceeding what I have set out above as an appropriate sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">PURCHASE OR BUYBACK OF FOOD IMPROVERS' SHARES IN BGR 
 
274 Although an order under s 233 of the Act was sought that Triad and/or Cordato Parter Services purchase Food Improver's shares in BGR, or that BGR purchase Food Improver's shares, this claim was not pressed in final submissions and I have not addressed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">The plaintiffs indicated, through unchallenged expert evidence, that valuers could value those shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">Since the evidence is that there is no substantive business being carried on by BGR or its subsidiaries, I am of opinion that no purpose would be served in making such an order and that the interests of the parties will be better served by an order winding up BGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">The process of valuation would be expensive and at the end of the process there would be no guarantee that, after a further hearing, the orders would be given a practical operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">Any order for purchase, or buying back, of shares would require the purchaser to pay Food Improvers some time in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">The final resolution of this dispute should not be postponed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">SHOULD A RECEIVER BE APPOINTED?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">
 
275 Mr Max Prentice and Mr Murray Smith, both experienced insolvency practitioners and liquidators, gave evidence concurrently as to the likely work and associated costs involved in a court ordered liquidation of the BGR group of six companies which are defendants in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">They noted that none of those companies is now particularly active.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">Mr Prentice pointed out that a number of the debtors outstanding at the time he had prepared his report of September 2006 had subsequently been collected and so the work involved in a liquidation was somewhat reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">Each gave varying estimates of the costs which a court ordered liquidation would involve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">It is not necessary for me to resolve that factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">At the end of the day there was broad agreement on those costs other than those associated with the liquidation of BARM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">That was because of the complication of the ongoing and unresolved litigation with the Australian Tax Office in which a refund of over $9 million is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">Both experts agreed that a liquidator would need to become quite involved in that litigation because of the potential for personal liability were it unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">To the extent that they differ, I prefer Mr Smith's methodology because it addressed the detailed tasks which a liquidator would need to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">Mr Prentice, on the other hand, formed a broad brush estimate based on his experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1517">I do not mean to criticise Mr Prentice for that approach but simply to prefer Mr Smith's clearer and more closely justified method of arriving at his result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">Both experts gave their evidence with complete professional detachment and undertook the task of assisting the court as one would expect from two such experienced professionals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">276 The plaintiffs have not given any detailed explanation as to why a receiver of BGR would be appropriate or preferable to a court appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">On the evidence BGR has no ongoing business apart from realising its assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">The impact of appointment of a receiver or a liquidator would not appear to make any substantial difference to that exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">A court appointed liquidator would enable BGR's affairs to be wound up, including the use of the liquidator's controlling shareholding in each of the other subsidiaries which are parties to appoint the liquidator or a nominee as a director and remove Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato or any other persons as directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">Again, a liquidator would be in a position to make an assessment, once he or she were appointed to the board of BARM, as to how that company's litigation with the Australian Tax Office should be conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">It will be necessary to have cooperation from Mr Gulson and Mr Bax in the running of that litigation, but given the potential benefit each stands to gain from a successful outcome, I am confident that each will be willing to cooperate with an independent third party in its pursuit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">There was no evidence as to the cost of the receiver being any less than that of a court appointed liquidator or of any other benefit of a receiver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">Indeed, Mr Prentice said that a court appointed receiver of a solvent company sometimes increases costs and does not necessarily resolve the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">277 I will hear the parties on whether it is preferable to have a liquidator rather than a receiver appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">I cannot see on the material now before me any benefit in having a receiver as opposed to a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">A liquidator will bring finality to the affairs of the parties, which in my opinion, is necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">A receiver may leave other matters unresolved in circumstances where I do not see the parties as being able themselves to resolve them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1531">While each of a receiver or a liquidator can make an application to the court for directions, my preliminary opinion is that an order for the winding up of BGR should be made and the liquidator will then have a discretion as to the appropriate method of bringing to an end the affairs of the other companies in the group by virtue of the liquidator's control of them BGR's shareholdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1532">In the meantime, it is necessary to order that each of BGR and the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth defendants be restrained from entering into any transactions or making any decisions, including in relation to the BARM litigation otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, so that a liquidator can consider what ought to be done about the composition of the boards and the continuing affairs of each of those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">COSTS 
 
278 In my opinion the Triad and Cordato Partners Services should pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">If they are unable to do so, then the other defendants, should pay any difference in the amount the plaintiffs are able to recover from Triad and Cordato Partners Services and the amount at which the costs are taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">279 The plaintiffs have sought a special order in respect of the costs of Mr Lawson who came to Sydney to be cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">The costs associated with Mr Lawson's evidence will be the plaintiffs' costs in the proceedings and be recoverable on a taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">I see no need for any special order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">280 In their final submissions the plaintiffs asked for an order vacating an order made by Hely J on 22 July 2005 when refusing interlocutory relief.</sentence>
