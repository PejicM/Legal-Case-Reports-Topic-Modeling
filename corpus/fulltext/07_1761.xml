<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant has brought a proceeding against the respondent seeking orders under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) and, in particular, the imposition of a penalty against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In the course of the proceeding the applicant filed a list of documents in which he claimed legal professional privilege in respect of a class of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The respondent advised the Court that he wanted to challenge the claim for legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I directed the applicant to identify with some particularity each of the documents in the class of documents for which legal professional privilege was claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicant provided the respondent and the Court with a list setting out with some particularity the documents for which legal professional privilege was claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 On the last occasion that the Court sat, the respondent sought production of a number of those documents on the ground that the applicant had a duty, akin to a prosecutorial duty in the criminal law, to provide the respondent with the documents for which legal professional privilege was claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The respondent at that time accepted that the documents would be privileged and free from production, except for, as the respondent put it, that the applicant owed a prosecutorial duty to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 At that time I advised Mr Ats, who appeared for the respondent, that there was authority against the proposition which he advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I drew his attention to a decision of this Court in Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 147 and, in particular, [112] of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That decision was a decision of the Full Court of this Court of which I was a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In my reasons in that decision, I considered a submission which had been put to the primary judge and to the Full Court that, in a claim for a civil penalty, the applicant owed a prosecutorial duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 I agreed with Heerey J that there was no obligation resting upon the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) of the kind that rests upon a prosecutor in a criminal trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The proceedings were civil proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The principles of prosecutorial fairness do not apply in civil penalty proceedings: Adler v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 179 FLR 1 at [678] per Giles J (Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing); Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Rich (2005) 53 ACSR 320 at [358].</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Whether the ACCC had an obligation to discover and produce these documents fell to be considered under the ordinary rules relating to discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The other members of the Court agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 I advised the respondent's solicitor in this matter then, as I previously had advised the respondent's counsel, that that decision and the decisions of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales meant that as a judge at first instance, I could not accede to an argument that the applicant in this case owed the respondent any duty of the kind that a prosecutor owes in the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 When the matter was called on today for argument, Mr Griffin QC, who appeared for the respondent, accepted that I was bound by the decisions to which I have referred and that there was no authority contrary to those decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He has asked me to rule on his client's application for production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I do so and the application is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Associate:
