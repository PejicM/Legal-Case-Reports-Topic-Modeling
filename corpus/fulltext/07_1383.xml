<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 Golden Circle Limited (the Company) has brought a motion seeking to set aside a subpoena duces tecum issued by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The company says the subpoena is too wide, fishing and unfairly prejudicial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 This proceeding was commenced by the applicants Merim Pty Ltd and Mr Peter Yunghanns on 17 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Mr Yunghanns is a director of Merim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In the statement of claim it is alleged that Merim holds approximately 5.9 per cent of the issued share capital in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It is further alleged that on 18 May 2007 Merim made an offer to acquire a minority interest of ordinary shares in the Company at a price of 65 cents per share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I was told in the course of argument that while the offer in its terms expired on 30 June 2007 Merim remains willing and able to acquire further shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The statement of claim further alleges that in or about late May 2007 the Company retained the respondents The Oaktower Partnership Pty Ltd and Mr Oliver Klotz a director of Oaktower to provide corporate advisory services to it "with a view to persuading shareholders not to sell their shares in the Company to Merim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">" The specifics of the allegation are as follows: 
 
 Particulars of the retainer are unknown to the Applicants save to say that at a meeting of shareholders of the Company held on 1 June 2007 at Beerwah in Queensland the Board of the Company introduced Klotz to those present so that he may handle the "Yunghanns issue".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Further particulars will be provided following discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">

4 It is then alleged that on about 1 June 2007 Oaktower by its servant or agent Klotz represented to a meeting of a group of shareholders of the Company in the presence of the Board of Directors of the Company that (a) Merim and Yunghanns intended to and would decimate the grower/shareholders of the Company by making the Company purchase fruit from overseas; (b) if Merim and Yunghanns acquired further shares in the Company then they would cause the Company to stop purchasing produce from local growers and (c) Merim and Yunghanns had caused Sunbeam Foods Limited to stop buying produce locally and to by all fruit from overseas .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
5 The statement of claim alleges that the statements made at the 1 June 2007 meeting were misleading and deceptive and in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 At the time of the hearing of the motion no defence had been filed, but at an earlier directions hearing I was informed that the respondents deny the alleged statements were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">An application for an interlocutory injunction is currently on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 Part of the background to this case is that the Company is considering alternatives for major financial restructuring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">An extraordinary general meeting has been called for 24 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The meeting will also deal with motions for the removal of some directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 I turn first to some preliminary matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">First, as to confidentiality, counsel for the applicants told the court that counsel and solicitors for the applicants will give an undertaking as to confidentiality in the form of the schedule annexed to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">9 Secondly, as to redaction, the Company does not dispute the validity of the subpoena in relation to categories 3, 6 and 7, subject to redaction of irrelevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Insofar as other categories are found to be valid, the Company may also seek to redact portions of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">After discussion with counsel, I indicated that I will deal with this question on the basis that I will be provided with redacted and unredacted versions of documents otherwise liable to be produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I will give a preliminary ruling as to what redaction should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Mr Corbett for the applicants will have the opportunity to make submissions on the proposed redactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He will be given the unredacted versions, subject, of course, to the confidentiality undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">10 Thirdly, many of the categories of documents in the subpoena speak of documents during a period from a particular date "to date".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Corbett accepts that the better date is the date of the issue of the subpoena, namely 23 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The terms of the subpoena should be amended accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 Categories 3, 6 and 7 are not in dispute and read as follows: 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Any original or copy presentation or report prepared by Oaktower or Klotz and presented to the Board of Directors of the Company by Oaktower or Klotz regarding or recording information in respect of the financial performance of, valuation, or earnings of Sunbeam Foods Limited during the period from 1 September 2006 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">All notes, memorandum, correspondence, reports, minutes or other documents recording a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company with shareholders of the Company held at the Beerwah RSL in Queensland on or about 1 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 
 
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">All notes, memorandum, correspondence, reports, minutes or other documents passing between the Company and Oaktower or the Company and Klotz regarding a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company with shareholders of the Company held at Beerwah RSL in Queensland on about 1 June 2007 including but not limited to any document created after that date recording what was said at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 
 

12 Categories 1 and 2 are: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Any original or copy letter of offer, retainer, consultancy agreement, services agreement or other document recording the terms of engagement between Golden Circle Limited ("the Company") and Oaktower Partnership Pty Ltd ("Oaktower") for the provision of consulting, advisory or valuation services by Oaktower to the Company during the period from 1 September 2006 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Any original or copy letter of offer, retainer, consultancy agreement, services agreement or other document recording the terms of engagement between the Company and Mr. Oliver Klotz ("Klotz") for the provision of consulting, advisory or valuation services by Klotz to the Company during the period from 1 September 2006 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 

13 In my opinion, the terms of any retainer are relevant as going to the likelihood or otherwise of Mr Klotz making the alleged statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 It was said that the commencement date of 1 September 2006 for these categories was too early given that the Merim offer was not made until 18 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">15 The applicants filed an affidavit by Mr John Cook who was the Chief Executive Officer of the Company from 1 March 2006 until 6 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He deposes that "in about November 2006" the Company retained Oaktower to advise on a possible acquisition of a firm called P &amp; N Foods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Klotz was the director of Oaktower responsible for providing the advice to the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In the course of his work on this retainer, Mr Klotz advised the Board of the Company regarding other recent comparable sales of food businesses, including Sunbeam Foods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The matter is not put any more precisely than that, but I think it would be reasonable if the commencing date of the period in categories 1 and 2 was altered to 1 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 Categories 4 and 5 are: 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Any original copy deed of indemnity, confidentiality agreement, indemnity agreement, undertaking or other agreement between the Company and Oaktower or the Company and Klotz regarding the provision of information to grower/shareholders of the Company by Oaktower or Klotz in respect of the offer to acquire shares in the Company made by Merim Pty Ltd on 18 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Any original copy deed of indemnity, indemnity agreement, undertaking or other agreement between the Company and Oaktower or the Company and Klotz regarding the provision of information to grower/shareholders of the Company by Oaktower or Klotz in respect of the financial performance of, or the acquisition of goods for re-supply by Sunbeam Foods Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 

 In my view, the arrangements between Mr Klotz and the Company as to his dealings with shareholders in connection with the Merim offer provide the immediate background to the meeting of 1 June and may provide documents which tend to show the likelihood or otherwise of Mr Klotz making the alleged statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">17 Category 8 is as follows:
 
 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Any original or copy letter, memo or note recording any instructions or directions given by the Company to Oaktower or Klotz regarding the offer by Merim Pty Ltd to acquire shares in the Company during the period from about 18 May 2007 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 

 The instructions given by the Company to Oaktower and Mr Klotz may show what Mr Klotz was to do or not do in relation to the alleged purpose of defeating the Merim offer and thus would bear on the probability or otherwise of him making the alleged statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">18 Category 9 is as follows:
 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Any original or copy letter, memo, minute, note, paper or report recording any advice given to the Company by Oaktower or Klotz regarding their dealings with shareholders of the Company given during the period from 18 May 2007 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 I think this is too wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is unrelated to the Merim offer or Sunbeam or the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

19 Category 10 is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Any original or copy letter, memo, minute, note, time sheet, invoice, paper or report recording or in respect of any advice given to the Company by Oaktower or Klotz regarding the Company's dealings with Merim Pty Ltd or Mr. Peter Yunghanns during the period from 18 May 2007 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 
 I think this is sufficiently related to the Merim offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

20 Category 11, with the additions of letters (a) after the word "Klotz," and (b) after the word "or" in the fourth line reads as follows: 
 
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Any original or copy minute, report, memo, note or board paper recording or containing any briefing given to the Board of Directors of the Company by Oaktower or Klotz (a) concerning any meeting or dealings with grower/shareholders of the Company or (b) relating to the offer to acquire shares in the Company made by Merim Pty Ltd during the period 18 May 2007 to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 
 

 I think 11(a) is too wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is not related to the Merim offer or Sunbeam or the meeting, but otherwise category 11 is valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">21 It was put by Mr Austin on behalf of the Company that categories 6 and 7 catch documents relating to what happened at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">If the document did not come into existence before 1 June or does not record what happened at the meeting, it could not be said to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">22 It often happens that categories in a subpoena overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">A particular document may fall within two or more categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">This is not necessarily fatal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In the present case documents "recording" or "regarding" the meeting may not quite catch some other documents which, perhaps in an indirect way, throw light on the probabilities of what happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">An example is the document dealing with the nature of The Oaktower Partnership's retainer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">23 The Court orders that:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Pursuant to O 27 r 4:
 
(a) the words " to date " in each of paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 11 of the schedule to the subpoena (" the subpoena ") issued by the Applicants and dated 23 July 2007 and addressed to Golden Circle Ltd (" Golden Circle ") are set aside and replaced with the words " to the date of the subpoena ";

(a) copies redacted as Golden Circle contends they should be redacted;

<sentence id="s80">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The Applicants have liberty to apply, upon provision of not less than 48 hours written notice to Minter Ellison, solicitors for Golden Circle, for orders or directions that:
 
(c) inspection of the documents produced pursuant to paragraph 2 above be permitted by persons other than solicitors and/or counsel representing the Applicants without the execution of a confidentiality undertaking;
 
(d) any part or the whole of any redaction of any document by Golden Circle produced pursuant to paragraph 2 above be unmasked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Golden Circle's Motion by Notice dated 14 August 2007 is otherwise dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The costs of Golden Circle's Motion by Notice dated 14 August 2007 are reserved.</sentence>
