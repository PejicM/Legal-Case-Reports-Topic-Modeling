1 Mr John Lapidario was a young Phillipino man.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He emigrated to Australia when he was 16 years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Some four years later he was dead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He died on 25 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 Mr Lapidario was killed as a result of an accident that occurred on that day at a warehouse controlled by the Respondent at Wetherill Park, New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">From 16 August 2004 until his death, he had been employed by a labour hire agency, Landmark Industrial Recruitment Pty Ltd (" Landmark ") and worked in the Respondent's warehouse as a picker and packer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 At about 2.45 pm on 25 May 2006 a forklift was being driven at the warehouse by a certified forklift driver, Mr Tran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr Lapidario engaged in some " horseplay ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He climbed onto the forklift and placed his hand on the driver's head and neck and his other hand under the driver's leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The reverse pedal was accidentally engaged and the forklift reversed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Lapidario was crushed between the forklift and a pole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He could not be resuscitated and died at the scene.</sentence>

<sentence id="s16">The Respondent was there convicted under s 8(1) of the New South Wales Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 A report into the death of Mr Lapidario was undertaken by an Investigator appointed under s 40(2)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 These tragic facts are the occasion of the present Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 THE APPLICATION 
 
7 In its Application , Comcare seeks a declaration that Post Logistics Australasia Pty Limited (" Post Logistics ") has contravened subclause 2(1) of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act in respect of a breach of s 16(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Comcare also seeks an order for the payment of a pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 Schedule 2 of the 1991 Act makes it mandatory for this Court to make a declaration where it considers that s 16 has been breached, but confers a discretion as to the imposition of a pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 In proceedings seeking a declaration and a pecuniary penalty, the Court is to apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters: sch 2, cl 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 There is agreement between the parties that it is appropriate for the making of the declaration as sought and further agreement as to the imposition of a penalty in the sum of $165,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">11 Section 16(1) provides as follows:
 Duties of employers in relation to their employees etc. (1) An employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Section 16(4) is also of relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">That sub-section provides as follows:
 (4) The obligations of an employer in respect of the employer's employees that are set out in subsections (1) and (2) apply also in respect of persons who are contractors of that employer but only in relation to: (a) matters over which the employer has control; or (b) matters over which the employer would have had control but for an express provision in an agreement made by the employer with such a contractor to the contrary, being matters over which the employer would, in the circumstances, usually be expected to have had control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">A " contractor " is further relevantly defined by s 9A as follows:
 Contractor (1) A contractor is: (a) a Commonwealth contractor (see subsection (2)); or (b) a Commonwealth authority contractor (see subsection (3)); or (c) a non Commonwealth licensee contractor (see subsection (4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Commonwealth contractor (2) A Commonwealth contractor is a natural person (other than a Commonwealth employee or a Commonwealth authority employee) who performs work on Commonwealth premises in connection with a contract between: (a) the Commonwealth; and (b) that person or another person (whether a natural person or not); which is in connection with an undertaking being carried on by the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Schedule 2 relevantly provides as follows:
 1 Courts that may exercise jurisdiction under this Part The only courts that may exercise jurisdiction under this Part are the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of each State or Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">2 Declarations of contravention (1) If a court considers that a person has breached one of the following provisions, or was involved in such a breach, it must make a declaration that the person has contravened this subclause: (a) subsection 16(1) (duties of employers in relation to their employees etc.)... ... 
 And cl 4 of sch 2 provides as follows:
 4 Pecuniary penalty orders (1) If a court has declared, under subclause 2(1), a contravention of that subclause by a person because the person breached, or was involved in the breach of, a provision listed in that subclause, the court may order the person to pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">(2) The pecuniary penalty must not exceed the amount stated in the table to be the maximum penalty in relation to the provision concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The maximum penalty prescribed for a contravention of s 16(1) is 2,200 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A " penalty unit " is defined by s 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) as being $110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 Various responsibilities have been entrusted to Comcare by the 1991 Act including functions in respect to the provision of advice to employers (s 38A); the appointment of investigators to undertake investigations as to compliance with the Act (ss 40 and 41); the entry upon premises and requiring the provision of assistance with respect to the conduct of an investigation (ss 42 and 43); and the issuing of notices requiring " improvement " (s 47).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 77(1) is the provision which ( inter alia ) authorises Comcare to institute proceedings for a breach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">13 For the purposes of resolving the Application , the parties helpfully prepared a Statement of Agreed Facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Comcare also relied upon parts of an Affidavit of its employee who undertook the investigation into the death of Mr Lapidario, Ms Jackie Somerville.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Respondent relied upon parts of an Affidavit of a manager of the Respondent, Mr Michael Halloran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Reliance upon the balance of the evidence as filed became unnecessary given the agreement reached on the first day of the hearing as to the quantum of the penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">14 The facts as agreed disclose that Mr Lapidario was provided with what can only be described as minimal instructions directed at ensuring his safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">15 On 12 August 2004 he completed an " OHS Induction Questionnaire ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On 16 August he received what is described as " induction training " and prior to commencement of work at the warehouse he received further " induction training ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That training consisted of a verbal instruction " to keep out of the way of moving machinery " and verbal instructions as to safety rules, emergency evacuation procedure, lifting, administrative matters and site amenities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He also watched an " OH&amp;S Instruction Video " and received a certificate acknowledging that he had read an induction manual and completed a questionnaire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He also attended a series of " Take 5 " talks, being talks taking about five minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Those " Take 5 " talks covered a variety of matter varying from heat stress, drugs and alcohol and workplace emergencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">16 Such training and instructions as he should have been given were not given by either Landmark or by the present Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">17 The supervisors and team leaders of the present Respondent at the time had not received any specific training as to the performance of their duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">They had not been given adequate or clear instructions as to the need to ensure that there was no " horseplay " or " skylarking " in the vicinity of forklifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">They were expected to " learn on the job ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There was no program in place to formally evaluate or monitor the performance of supervisors or team leaders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">18 Since Mr Lapidario's death, changes have taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">A system has been put in place to monitor the performance of supervisors and team leaders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Traffic barriers have been put in place to separate moving forklifts from pedestrians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The site where Mr Lapidario was killed was previously an area shared by machinery and pedestrians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is now only an area for the operation of forklifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 Whereas none of the " Take 5 " sessions related to " horseplay ", there are now in place more regular and comprehensive training sessions directed to employees and contractors, including pickers and packers, regarding " horseplay " and appropriate behaviour in and around forklifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">A DECLARATION?</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
20 Although cl 2 of sch 2 to the 1991 Act imposes a requirement upon this Court to make a declaration in the event that it considers there has been a breach of (in this case) s 16, the power of the Court to make such a declaration remains s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">21 The power conferred by s 21 is a discretionary power which is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed (at 581---2):
 It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is a discretionary power which "[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">" However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Hence, declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The person seeking relief must have "a real interest" and relief will not be granted if the question "is purely hypothetical", if relief is "claimed in relation to circumstances that [have] not occurred and might never happen" or if "the Court's declaration will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">(citations omitted) 
22 Given the functions entrusted to Comcare by the 1991 Act, there can be no question but that Comcare has " a real interest " in securing the relief which is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Indeed, cl 5 to sch 2 of the 1991 Act expressly provides that either Comcare or an investigator may apply for a declaration of contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">23 The manner in which the Court is to inform itself as to whether or not there has been a breach of the 1991 Act is not surprisingly left unspecified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Whether or not there has been a breach may involve, in some cases, a contested and lengthy hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Alternatively, and as in the present proceeding, the parties may provide to the Court a statement of agreed facts and limited further evidence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
24 In regulatory contexts comparable to the present, this Court has informed itself as to those facts necessary for the granting of declaratory relief by reference to agreed facts and indeed the consent of the parties: Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV 'Mawashi Al Gasseem' (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 at [10] ---[16], [2007] FCA 815 ; 240 ALR 120 at 122---4; Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1534 at [10] per Nicholson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v EDirect Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 65 at [20] ---[30], ATPR 42---216; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [74] ---[79]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] , [34], ATPR 41---801.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">25 No different approach, it is considered, is warranted in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">26 The Statement of Agreed Facts, including the admission of those facts as pleaded in the Further Amended Statement of Claim , provides a basis upon which the Court can be satisfied that there has indeed been a breach of s 16(1) of the 1991 Act and those matters specified in cl 2(3) of sch 2 to that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Moreover, such of the Affidavit of Ms Somerville as was relied upon provided evidence in support of the Statement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">27 The parties are in agreement that there was a failure to " take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety " of Mr Tran, he being an " employee " of the Respondent; there was also agreement that there had been a failure to " take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety " of Mr Lapidario, he being a " contractor ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The finding in respect to Mr Lapidario arises by reason of the extended reach of s 16(1) effected by s 16(4) of the 1991 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">28 Declaratory relief should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The form of the declaration was also the subject of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">QUANTIFICATION OF PENALTY: PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED 
 
29 Clause 4 of sch 2 of the 1991 Act confers both a discretion to impose a penalty and further provides that any such penalty " must not exceed the amount stated in the table to be the maximum penalty ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">But there the guidance provided by the legislature both begins and ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The criteria by reference to which the discretion is to be exercised are left unspecified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">30 Schedule 2 to the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides another example of the recourse by the Commonwealth legislature to civil penalties as a means of regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">As stated at [1.181] of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 (Cth):
 New Schedule 2 is modelled in large part on the enforcement approach of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , which is in turn modelled on the Corporation Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The Explanatory Memorandum also refers to:
 ... the additional flexibility given to employers to develop appropriate arrangements at the workplace level is balanced by a strong, effective and responsive enforcement regime by: ... Providing for civil penalties as far as possible, reserving criminal penalties for more serious breaches of the Act where there has been a death or serious bodily harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Criminal penalties are also being retained for offences which are more appropriately dealt with in the criminal justice system, such as contempt of the Commission or failing to attend before the Commission as a witness...</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Although the present proceeding involved the death of Mr Lapidario, it should be noted that cl 18(1)(c) to sch 2 of the Act confines criminal prosecutions to those cases where death or serious bodily injury was the result of either negligence or recklessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">There was no suggestion that the death of Mr Lapidario was the result of either negligence or recklessness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Consideration can thus presently be confined to the discretion relevant to civil proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">31 Having set the maximum penalty that may be imposed, the discretion as to that which is otherwise considered to be the appropriate penalty is one which must necessarily be informed by reference to the balance of the statutory scheme, including most relevantly the objects sought to be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Those objects are specified in s 3 of the 1991 Act as follows:
 Objects The objects of this Act are: (a) to secure the health, safety and welfare at work of employees of the Commonwealth, of Commonwealth authorities and of non Commonwealth licensees; and (b) to protect persons at or near workplaces from risks to health and safety arising out of the activities of such employees at work; and (c) to ensure that expert advice is available on occupational health and safety matters affecting employers, employees and contractors; and (d) to promote an occupational environment for such employees at work that is adapted to their needs relating to health and safety; and (e) to foster a co operative consultative relationship between employers and employees on the health, safety and welfare of such employees at work; and (f) to encourage and assist employers, employees and other persons on whom obligations are imposed under the Act to observe those obligations; and (g) to provide for effective remedies if obligations are not met, through the use of civil remedies and, in serious cases, criminal sanctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The statutory scheme also relevantly includes Part 2 as it applies to s 16 and the duty of an employer to " take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Such a duty must be regarded as fundamental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">32 In the statutory context of the present legislation, Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth [2007] FCA 662 , 163 FCR 207.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November 1994 as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">His Honour there observed:
 [120] Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others: (i) the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally, to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety; (ii) it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable; (iii) the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer; (iv) the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety; (v) a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision; (vi) general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act; (vii) employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">This implies constant vigilance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In view of the scope of those obligations, in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety; (viii) regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration; (xi) the neglect of simple, well-known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury, take a matter towards the worst case category; (x) the objective seriousness of the offence, without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">These considerations, it was concluded, " provide [d] useful, analogical, general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">His Honour noted that the maximum penalty was 2,200 penalty units, a penalty of less than $250,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The maximum penalty would be appropriate where there had been a " conscious decision to flout the law ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">A penalty of 1,800 penalty units ($198,000) was ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">His Honour found that there had been " systemic failures of the most serious kind ": at [125].</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">33 In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 , 98 ALD 67 a penalty of $20,000 had been agreed between the parties and ordered by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Whilst not downplaying the serious risks involved, the injuries sustained by the workers were relatively mild.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Gyles J there further observed:
 [8] All things considered, I am satisfied that the pecuniary penalty proposed is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">As the cases indicate, it is not so much a question of me deciding what figure I would independently propose and then seeing whether it accords with the figure proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">A commonsense approach is to take the agreed figure and give consideration to whether it is within the range of appropriate figures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In my opinion it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I make the orders set out in the draft order which I have initialled and placed with the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">34 Although the particular legislative regime which is being enforced must always remain the source whereby considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty are to be discerned, there nevertheless remain some more general considerations that inform the discretion being exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">35 Many other Commonwealth Acts provide for a regulator to approach this Court seeking an order for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty as a means of securing compliance with legislative provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">A degree of learning has emerged from those authorities dealing with those other legislative provisions as to the matters to be taken into account when assessing a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">36 In the statutory context of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), French J (as he then was) has attempted to summarise some of these considerations: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">When assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s 76(1) of the 1974 Act His Honour observed (at 52,152---52,153):
 The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">These include the following: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The nature and extent of the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The amount of loss or damage caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The circumstances in which the conduct took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The size of the contravening company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">These considerations have since been applied to other legislative contexts: eg, Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No 3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [51] , [2004] FCA 1317 ; 136 LGERA 89 ; Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Derstepanian [2005] FCA 1121 at [30] ; Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">37 These considerations may also be applied to the task of assessing the penalty to be imposed under the current legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">To some extent the considerations set forth by Madgwick J overlap with those set forth by French J; to some extent they do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">38 Care must be taken to ensure that any listing of potentially relevant considerations do not themselves become an impermissible substitute for considering the terms of the legislation in issue or an unnecessary constraint upon a discretion conferred in otherwise unconfined terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">But the attempts that have been made by both Madgwick and French JJ (in particular) provide a useful touchstone of those matters that may be taken into account when assessing the penalty to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Those considerations set forth by Madgwick J are obviously more directed to the specific statutory context of ensuring the health and safety of workers than the more generally expressed considerations set forth by French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">But both, it is considered, are relevant to the present assessment of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">39 A final matter of principle should also be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It is inappropriate to fix a penalty simply by reference to the quantum of a penalty imposed in another case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It was thus understood to be common ground between the parties to the present proceeding that it was not appropriate to regard (in particular) the penalty of $198,000 in Comcare v Commonwealth as itself fixing a " benchmark " against which other penalties are to be determined in cases involving death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed (at 295):
 A hallmark of justice is equality before the law, and, other things being equal, corporations guilty of similar contraventions should incur similar penalties: Trade Practices Commission v Axive Pty Ltd [(1994) ATPR 41-368] (at 42,795).</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">There should not be such an inequality as would suggest that the treatment meted out has not been even-handed: cf the criminal law case Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46 ; (1984) 154 CLR 606.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">However, other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In the present case, differing circumstances, size, market power and responsibility for the contraventions, as well as other factors, complicate any attempt to compare the penalties imposed on the appellant with those imposed on the other corporations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Another form of comparison is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The facts of the instant case should not be compared with a particular reported case in order to derive therefrom the amount of the penalty to be fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Cases are authorities for matters of principle; but the penalty found to be appropriate, as a matter of fact, in the circumstances of one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in the different circumstances of another case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The point was well made by Spender J in Trade Practices Commission v Annand and Thompson Pty Ltd [(1987) ATPR 40-772] (at 48,394) when he said: 
 
 "Each case must, of course, be viewed on its own facts and facts may be infinite in their variety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">" 
 
 It follows, as his Honour also said, that "[t]he quantum of penalties imposed in other cases can seldom be of very much direct assistance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">A comparison of the facts in Comcare v Commonwealth and the facts in the present proceeding only serves to underline the point there being made by Burchett and Kiefell JJ (and by Spender J) -- namely that the facts and circumstances of individual cases are infinitely diverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The quantum of any penalty to be imposed must necessarily be fixed by reference to the peculiar facts arising in each case as and when they arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">QUANTIFICATION OF PENALTY: AGREEMENT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">
 
40 In the present proceeding it is considered that an appropriate penalty is $165,000 -- that being the sum as agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">41 In imposing that penalty, consideration has been given to both:
 
&#8226; the agreement as between the parties; and 
 
&#8226; the facts and circumstances as set forth in the Statement of Agreed Facts and such evidence as has been relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">42 The extent to which this Court may inform itself as to the appropriate quantification of any penalty to be imposed by reference to any agreement between the parties has been the subject of consideration in the context of other legislation: eg, Secretary, Department of Health &amp; Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [33] ---[42].</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Reference was there made to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 and to the earlier decision in NW Frozen Foods .</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Full Court in Mobil Oil continued on to observe:
 [51] The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods: (i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s 76 of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">(ii) Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">(iii) There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">(iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">(v) In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">(vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The question is whether that figure is, in the Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">It will be appropriate if within the permissible range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia [2007] FCA 1548 at [4] , [2007] FCA 1548 ; 98 ALD 67 at 68 Gyles J referred to Mobil Oil and accepted that " that decision does provide appropriate guidance ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">43 Of particular concern is the need to ensure that this Court is " not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties ": cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 at [18] , [1999] FCA 18 ; 161 ALR 79 at 86 per French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The Court is not to be regarded as a " rubber stamp ": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Abalone Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1834 at [121] , ATPR 42-199 per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">44 No different approach was advanced in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">45 In fixing the penalty at $165,000, considerations has been given in particular to the following matters, namely:
 
&#8226; the fact that the breach of the duty occasioned the death of Mr Lapidario;
 
&#8226; the lack of attention previously given to the training extended to supervisors and team leaders;
 
&#8226; the lack of attention previously given to the training of employees and contractors; 
 
&#8226; the fact that there was a degree of " horseplay " engaged in by Mr Lapidario himself;
 
&#8226; the steps which have been implemented since his death in an effort to ensure that the health and safety of employees is now protected; 
 
&#8226; the contrition expressed by the present Respondent; and 
 
&#8226; the fact that the Respondent has been able to reach agreement with Comcare as to those facts considered by the parties to be relevant to the penalty to be imposed, thereby not necessitating a contested hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">In so proceeding, it is accepted that the Respondent has expressed a " willingness to facilitate the course of justice ": Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 at [74] , [2008] FCAFC 70 ; 168 FCR 383 at 404 per Stone and Buchanan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">46 Consideration has also been given to:
 
&#8226; the two earlier events that took place in November 2002 and July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It would be inappropriate to increase the penalty now to be imposed by reason of those two earlier contraventions of the New South Wales Act -- to do so " would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences ": Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 ; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">But those events do assume some limited relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">There was no explanation as to why those steps which have more recently been implemented in order to address the safety of employees working in the vicinity of forklifts were not implemented at a far earlier date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The dangers inherent in working in the vicinity of forklifts had very clearly emerged long ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">47 It is considered that it is " appropriate " to give effect to the agreement between the parties as to penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Whether or not the Court would have reached the same figure is not to the point; the sum of $165,000, as agreed between the parties, is within the " permissible range ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">ORDERS 
 
48 The Court declares that:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In or about March 2006 and on 25 May 2006 Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd contravened clause 2(1) of Schedule 2 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) by reason of its having breached section 16(1) of the said Act in that:
 
(a) The duties of Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd under subsection 16(1) apply not only in relation to its employees, but also, to the extent provided for in subsection 16(4), in relation to its contractors, as defined in section 9A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">(b) In or about March 2006 its contractor Mr John Lapidario approached a moving forklift operated by its employee Mr Van Trot Tran and disconnected the power on that forklift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">(c) On another occasion in or about March 2006 Mr Lapidario, without any qualifications or training to do so, operated a moving forklift in warehouse 1 in the vicinity of Mr Tran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">(d) On another occasion in or about March 2006 Mr Lapidario approached an operating forklift operated at the time by Mr Tran and applied the handbrake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">(e) At approximately 2.45 pm on 25 May 2006 Mr Tran was operating a forklift from the driver's seat in the vicinity of the work benches and immediately to the south of the southern-most rack of shelving at the Site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In an attempt to engage in horseplay with Mr Tran, Mr Lapidario climbed onto the forklift putting his right hand on Mr Tran's head and neck, and his left hand under Mr Tran's leg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The forklift travelled in reverse and Mr Lapidario was accidentally crushed between a pole and the forklift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Mr Lapidario died at the scene of the accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">In this regard Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd breached its duty under section 16(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) to take all reasonably practical steps to protect the health and safety at work of its employee Mr Tran and its contractor Mr Lapidario in that it:
 
(a) failed to provide adequate supervision or instruction to Mr Lapidario so as to ensure that he did not engage in the conduct set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">(b) failed to ensure that there was an adequate traffic management system in place to prevent or reduce the risk of Mr Lapidario coming into contact with a moving forklift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The Commonwealth entity to which the conduct related is Post Logistics Australasia Pty Ltd.
 
49 The Court orders that:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Pursuant to clause 4 of Schedule 2 of the said Act, Post Logistics pay the Commonwealth a penalty of $165,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The Respondent is to pay Comcare's costs as agreed, or in the absence of agreement, as taxed.</sentence>
