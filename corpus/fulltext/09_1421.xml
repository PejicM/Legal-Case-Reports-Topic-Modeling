<sentence id="s0">
 The appellants appeal from two judgments of Phipps FM published on 19 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellants are undischarged bankrupts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondent is their trustee in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In his first judgment, Phipps FM dismissed an application by the appellants that he disqualify himself from hearing an application to review a decision of a Registrar of the Court below made on 25 May 2009 ("the First Judgment"); see McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FMCA 695.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The substantive application before Phipps FM was for an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act") for the appellants to give a taxing officer notice of their wish to have the costs and remuneration of their trustee in bankruptcy taxed pursuant to reg 8.09 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) ("the Regulations").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In the second judgment, his Honour dismissed the application for review and ordered the appellants to pay the costs of that application and the costs before the Registrar ("the Second Judgment"); see McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FMCA 696.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 (i) Disqualification issue
 The appellants claim that Phipps FM should have disqualified himself from hearing the application because he had heard a similar matter previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">They also allege that the proceeding was part-heard before another Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">(ii) Substantive issue
 The appellants further allege that his Honour's judgment was made on "grounds that are not a factor for consideration" in the proper exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">(ii) Other grounds
 The appellants contend that Phipps FM failed to give them time "to read two submitted precedents" which were referred to in the reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In addition the appellants submit that his Honour "failed to seek the requested info from the respondent to be returnable 19 June 2009".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">RELEVANT LEGISLATION 
 Section 33(1)(c) of the Act provides that the Court may: 
 
 extend before its expiration or, if this Act does not expressly provide to the contrary, after its expiration, any time limited by this Act, or any time fixed by the Court or the Registrar under this Act (other than the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice), for doing an act or thing or abridge any such time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 Regulation 8.09(1) of the Regulations provides that: 
 
 Where the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt claims remuneration under section 162 of the Act, the bankrupt or a creditor who is dissatisfied with the amount of the claim may, by notice in writing lodged within 28 days of being notified in writing or becoming aware of the amount of the claim, request a taxing officer to tax the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 There is no provision of the Act which expressly provides that the time under reg 8.09(1) may not be extended or abridged pursuant to s 33(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">DISQUALIFICATION ISSUE
 In his First Judgment at [6] of his reasons, Phipps FM said: 
 
 The current application is an application that I disqualify myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This matter originally came before Burchardt FM on Monday of this week, that is, 15 June [2009] and he adjourned it for hearing until today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I imagine he would have initially adjourned it to hearing before him, given that it would have then been on his docket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Burchardt FM is unavailable and the matter has been assigned to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 It is apparent that Burchardt FM had not begun to substantially hear the matter and that therefore he was not part-heard in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is no reason why Phipps FM could not hear the matter assigned to him by another Federal Magistrate, providing there is no other valid basis for disqualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellants' main concern with Phipps FM hearing the application was that he had previously heard a case involving them in their bankruptcy matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The earlier proceeding was heard on 29 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On that date, his Honour observed that he had two matters before him: an application by the appellants to adjourn the proceeding and an application by the appellants to set aside a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Federal Magistrate Phipps refused the application for an adjournment of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">His Honour then proceeded to hear and dismiss the appellants' application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">At [13] in the First Judgment, Phipps FM said: 
 
 None of the issues on both the application for the adjournment and the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice [on 29 March 2004] involved any contested matters of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">None of them involved any issues of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">All of them argued questions of interpretation about circumstances which were not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 His Honour considered that there was no basis for the submission that a reasonable observer might consider that he would not bring an unbiased mind to the application before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">His Honour noted at [15] that the facts before him on the application concerning the trustee's costs and remuneration were not in dispute and that the case concerned whether he should exercise an available discretion having regard to those facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I agree with the views of Phipps FM referred to in the preceding paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Simply because a judicial officer has dealt with a matter concerning a litigant does not mean that she or he is disqualified from hearing any other matter involving that litigant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The case against disqualification is even stronger in circumstances, such as exist in this matter, where no contested issues of fact or credibility fell for determination in the previous proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The appeal grounds concerning his Honour's failure to disqualify himself on the basis of having previously heard a matter concerning the appellants is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In a similar vein, the appellants made an application at the commencement of the appeal hearing seeking that I disqualify myself on the basis that I had previously heard an application by the appellants on 3 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That earlier application sought a stay of sequestration orders against the appellants' estates and is referred to by Dowsett J in McKinnon v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1898.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">No contested issues of fact or credibility fell for determination in that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Simply because I dealt with an earlier matter involving the appellants, I did not consider that I was required to disqualify myself from hearing this appeal and ruled accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">RELIANCE ON PRECEDENTS 
 The appellants also complain of a failure by Phipps FM to allow them to consider two precedents submitted by the respondent during the course of the proceeding subject to this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The transcript of the proceeding in the Court below is not before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However, at [15] of the Second Judgment, Phipps FM said: 
 
 I have been referred by Mr Black to two decisions, Aparatne v Tredula [sic] (North J 18 December 1998, VG 7894 of 1998), and a decision McInnis FM, as he then was, Vince v Sellars [sic] (2004) FMCA 564.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">They are both concerned with applications to extend time in different circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">North J at [35] described the power to extend time as a broad discretionary power which is unfettered and must be exercised with a view to doing justice between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 Federal Magistrate Phipps did not otherwise refer to Vince .</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">His reliance on Abeyratne v Trkulja (1998) 90 FCR 253 was unexceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Doubtless the appellants were seeking to invoke a broad power in their favour to have justice to them done as they saw it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However there is nothing in the cases relied on by Phipps FM which was adverse to their position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The appellants' grounds of appeal based on this issue are also without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE 
 Background
 The appellants contend that, in deciding whether to extend the time in which the appellants could apply for a taxation of trustee's remuneration, his Honour was not entitled under the Act or the Regulations to have regard to the fact that the appellants would not derive any financial gain from a grant of the extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The following background matters are contained in the Second Judgment or are discernible from documents referred to in that judgment: Pursuant to reg 8.09 of the Regulations the remuneration of a trustee can be taxed, provided that notice is lodged with a taxing officer in writing within 28 days of the bankrupt or a creditor becoming aware of the amount of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">As the claim for remuneration was made on 8 December 2008, the request for taxation should have been made by 5 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">On 2 January 2009, the first appellant wrote to the respondent advising that the appellants intended to have his "costs" taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Further, on 4 January 2009, the first appellant sent an email to the respondent which said, "I will be giving notice that we will require your costs to be taxed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Although the appellants gave notice to the trustee that they wished to have his remuneration taxed, they gave no notice to a taxing officer within the required time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The respondent does not appear to have informed the appellants at any time that the notice requesting taxation had to be sent to the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia ("ITSA"), as the relevant taxing officer, before it could be effective under reg 8.09 of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The appellants only seem to have been made aware of the need to send the notice to ITSA after contacting ITSA on 16 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">On 31 March 2009, the appellants were informed of their right to make an application for an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In early April 2009, the appellants applied to the Court below to extend the time for them to give notice to seek to have a taxation of the trustee's remuneration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The judgment below
 Counsel for the respondent did not rely on any question of delay on the part of the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">At [8] of the Second Judgment, Phipps FM said: 
 
 The argument which is put is that to order a taxation of costs here would be futile because it can have no benefit for the applicants, the bankrupts, because there will not be any money left over in this estate on any view, even if trustee's remuneration is ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 At [13], Phipps FM noted that there was no prospect of any return of funds to the appellants and said that "[t]herefore they have no financial interest in having the trustee's remuneration taxed and possibly reduced".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">His Honour went on at [14] to observe that there was no evidence before him that taxation would reduce the trustee's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">His Honour therefore concluded at [15] that: 
 
 Justice is done between the parties if the application is refused because there is nothing to be gained by extending the time for giving notice for taxation and so allowing a taxation to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 The power to extend time under s 33(1)(c) of the Act is a broad discretionary power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is unfettered and must be exercised with a view to doing justice between the parties; see Abeyratne at 262 and see also Vince v Sellers [2004] FMCA 564 at [6] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In order to evaluate whether it is just to grant an extension of time it is necessary to consider all the factors which militate for and against an extension in the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Examples of relevant factors which may need to be taken into account include: the reason why the applicant did not perform the required act within the statutory time limit, the prejudice to other parties of allowing an extension of time and the public policy interest in allowing or refusing an application to extend time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In the exercise of his discretion pursuant to s 33(1)(c) his Honour focused solely on the question of whether the grant of an extension of time would be futile as it would not improve the financial circumstances of the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">His Honour did not appear to consider any other relevant factors in the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In denying an extension of time, on the ground of "futility" alone, his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion by allowing one matter to guide the exercise of that discretion to the exclusion of other material considerations; see, by way of analogy, House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504---5 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It can be seen by the ensuing discussion at [33]---[42] below that "futility" was not the sole criterion for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The discretion in the Court below having miscarried, it is appropriate that this Court should exercise that discretion afresh; see Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCAFC 120 at [5] per Goldberg, Jacobson and Tracey JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Consideration of the exercise of the discretion
 In determining whether to grant the extension of time requested by the appellants it is necessary to take into account a number of factors, in addition to the futility factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">First, the appellants' failure to lodge their notice for taxation within the required time period does not appear to be due to deliberate delay on their part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The appellants were dissatisfied with the claim for remuneration by the trustee and gave early notice to him that they would seek a taxation of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The appellants attempted to lodge a notice within the requisite time and appear to have made a genuine mistake about whom the notice should have been sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">They did not realise that they needed to apply to ITSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The fact the appellants have provided a reasonable explanation as to why they failed to comply with the requirements of reg 8.09(1) is a matter which weighs in favour of granting an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Second, the time lapse between the date by which the appellants should have lodged their notice under reg 8.09(1) and the date by which they applied for an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) was only about three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The appellants acted promptly once they became aware they had not lodged a notice in conformity with the requirements of reg 8.09(1) and could apply for an extension of time to comply with the terms of that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The fact that the delay was relatively brief and was not exacerbated by the appellants' conduct again weighs in favour of granting the extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The respondent stated before Phipps FM and at the hearing of this appeal that he takes "no issue on the question of delay".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The third factor which needs to be considered is that there is a public interest in ensuring that the time limits set out in the Regulations are adhered to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">As has been noted the purpose of the time limit in reg 8.09(1) is to ensure that finality and certainty are brought to the quantification of a trustee's remuneration within a relatively short period of time; see Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 at [34] per Lindgren J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This would ordinarily militate against the granting of an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">However, in the present case, the respondent was aware prior to the expiry of the statutory time limit in reg 8.09(1) that the appellants intended to request a taxation of his remuneration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The respondent cannot contend that he was surprised by the appellants' request to be allowed to lodge a notice for taxation after the 28 day period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The respondent has also not argued that he made any arrangements relying on the fact that the appellants failed to lodge a notice in conformity with reg 8.09 which will be disrupted if an extension of time is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Consequently, this argument is of little weight in the context of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Fourth, the respondent did not argue before Phipps FM that he would suffer any other prejudice if the extension of time is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">However, in his written submissions the respondent asserted that: 
 
 In circumstances where the appellants are bankrupt and have not paid the outstanding costs orders made by Moore R and Phipps FM it would not be doing justice to the respondent or the creditors of the appellants to allow the appellants to seek a taxation, which would incur further costs to the respondent and thereby reduce the amount available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 

This contention appears to assume that the remuneration claimed by the respondent will be upheld in any taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Whether the respondent is correct in his claim for remuneration and his entitlement to his costs of taxation may be a matter for the taxing officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It is not for this Court to pre-empt any such decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Any failure by the appellants to pay the respondent's costs to date is not relevant to issue for current determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The respondent has not shown that he would suffer any prejudice if the extension of time is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Indeed that is why he only relied on the futility factor in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The fifth factor to be taken into account is that the respondent has argued that the grant of the extension of time is futile because, in essence, even if the remuneration claimed by the respondent is taxed it will not improve the financial circumstances of the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The implication is that the sole purpose of reg 8.09(1) is to enable the bankrupt or a creditor to gain some tangible financial benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Giving primacy to this approach, to the exclusion of other factors, fails to recognise and respect the wider public interest inherent in reg 8.09(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">A trustee in bankruptcy is under an obligation to exercise reasonable skill in the performance of his or her duties and "[a] trustee in bankruptcy who acts for remuneration is under a duty of care greater than that of a gratuitous trustee"; see Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201 at 208 per Northrop, Wilcox and Cooper JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As a consequence, it has been held that under the Act: 
 
 the trustee's right to remuneration is limited to work properly undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In this context, "properly" means work reasonably and bona fide undertaken for the purpose of administering the estate or performing any public duty imposed by the Act, conformably with the trustee's duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 

 Adsett at 212 and see also Pantzer v Wenkart (2006) 153 FCR 466 at [43] per Black CJ, Ryan and Moore JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">There exists a public interest in ensuring that trustee's remuneration is open to objective scrutiny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">That public interest remains regardless of whether there would be any prospect of financial return to the appellants after the taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">A prima facie entitlement to taxation, provided by legislation which promotes the public interest, should not be overridden by factors peculiar to the financial standing of any particular bankrupt, without good reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">While the extension of time may arguably be futile, in the contexts of what remains in the estates, it does not mean that no benefit is gained by granting the extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">On the contrary, there is a significant public benefit in allowing the respondent's claim for remuneration to be taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">This weighs considerably in favour of granting the extension of time under s 33(1)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The respondent also relies on the creditors' approval of his claim for remuneration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">However, the creditor's approval of the claim does not diminish the public interest in ensuring that the trustee's remuneration is limited to work properly undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Act enables a bankrupt to request taxation regardless of the creditor's approval of the trustee in bankruptcy's remuneration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Similarly, the approval by creditors of a claim for remuneration does not mean that the claim for remuneration will be unchanged after taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The process of approval and taxation serve different aims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">I have taken all the above factors into account, in forming the view that his Honour's discretion miscarried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">In order to do justice between the parties the discretion should be exercised afresh on appeal and the appellants' application for time to be extended under s 33(1)(c) of the Act should be allowed, for the reasons set out at [33]---[42] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">ADDITIONAL COMMENTS 
 The appellants' grounds of appeal also allege that Phipps FM erred in that he "failed to seek the requested info from the respondent to be returnable 19 June 2009".</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It seems that this is a reference to the financial statement exhibited to the respondent's affidavit sworn on 12 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">That affidavit was filed before Burchardt FM on 15 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The appellants object to the affidavit and question the accuracy of its exhibit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Given the findings in relation to the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 33(1)(c) of the Act it is unnecessary to examine whether the Court below was mislead by the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">CONCLUSION 
 For the reasons set out above under the heading "substantive issue" the appeal should be allowed and an extension of time granted for the appellants to apply for a taxation of the respondents claim for remuneration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I certify that the preceding forty-six (46) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
