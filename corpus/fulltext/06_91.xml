<sentence id="s1">INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher [1988] HCA 7 ; (1988) 164 CLR 387 (" Waltons") at 423, Brennan J pointed to the difficulty of contending for an estoppel against a party's freedom to withdraw from contractual negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">His Honour said that it is only if the first party induces the other to believe that the inducer, ie the first party, is already bound and that there is no freedom to withdraw, that it could be unconscionable for the first party to assert an entitlement to withdraw from the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Notwithstanding this difficulty, the applicant contends that the respondent is estopped from interfering with its occupation, management and control of a parcel of land comprising about 202,000 square metres and known as the Acacia Ridge Interstate Container Terminal ("the AR terminal") near Brisbane in circumstances in which the respondent withdrew from negotiations for a 30 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The respondent owns an adjoining parcel of land comprising about 86,000 square metres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This is known as the Q-link Terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I will describe its location at [194].</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The respondent conducts rail freight services from the Q-link terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The applicant makes no claim to that terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">These proceedings are concerned solely with the applicant's claim in respect of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 The respondent owns the AR terminal, which is an intermodal terminal enabling the transfer of containers between trains and trucks which service the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The applicant went into possession, and assumed the management and operational control, of the AR terminal on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It has remained in occupation, management and control ever since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It occupied the AR terminal as a monthly tenant under an expired lease from April 1996 until its tenancy was purportedly terminated in May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It remained in occupation thereafter as explained below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 The applicant's estoppel claim is based upon fourteen pleaded assumptions which are said to have formed the conventional basis upon which the parties to this proceeding conducted their relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In final address, four of the pleaded assumptions were not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The applicant contends that the respondent is bound by a conventional estoppel or alternatively a proprietary estoppel or in the further alternative an equitable estoppel said to have arisen from the respondent's encouragement of the applicant to assume control in the expectation that a 30 year lease would be negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 Underlying the assumptions is an agreement known as the Establishment Agreement ("EA") entered into between the Commonwealth and a number of the States, including the State of Queensland, on 30 July 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is occasionally referred to in documents as the "Shareholders Agreement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 Until 1991, rail freight operations in Australia had been conducted by separate state owned railway companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Those operations had incurred disastrous losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The EA was an attempt to achieve micro-economic reform of the rail freight industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It was an exercise in co-operative federalism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It provided for the incorporation of a single company, in which the governmental parties to the EA may hold shares, to conduct rail freight operations on a commercial basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant, which was originally named National Rail Corporation Limited ("NRC"), was that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 The State of Queensland did not become a shareholder of NRC but it was subject to an obligation contained in cl 5(6)(a) of the EA to cause its rail authority to transfer ownership of, or for so long as NRC continues to conduct national interstate freight operations, give a lease of, or grant access to NRC in relation to assets owned by its rail authority and used in connection with interstate freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Queensland Railways was the State of Queensland's rail authority when the EA was executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Queensland Rail ("QR"), the respondent, is its successor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 Clause 5(6)(a) of the EA stated the framework through which the grant of ownership, lease or access rights was to be created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In 1992, NRC identified the AR terminal as an asset required by it in accordance with that framework.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Clause 5(6)(a) then provided that the State of Queensland had a discretion as to which of the three stipulated forms of property right would be granted, that is, ownership, lease or access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">There is an issue between the parties as to whether the discretion was exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 The concluding words of cl 5(6)(a) of the EA provided for the transfer of ownership or the grant of a lease or access rights to be on such commercial terms and conditions as were agreed between NRC and the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 Apart from the terms of a three year lease, commencing with effect in April 1993, no commercial terms and conditions were agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The three year lease was, for reasons dealt with later, a separate arrangement which was put in place outside the terms of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">12 Mr Vincent O'Rourke ("Mr O'Rourke") who was the CEO of the respondent, and of its predecessor Queensland Railways, conceded in cross-examination that the control of the AR terminal which was transferred to NRC in April 1993 was in anticipation of a lease of up to 30 years being negotiated between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Mr O'Rourke also conceded that it was confidently expected between himself and Mr Vince Graham ("Mr Graham") the Managing Director of NRC, that the necessary details for such a lease would be agreed between the parties and put in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 During the term of the three year lease NRC incurred or approved two relevant categories of capital expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The first was an amount of approximately $17 million on upgrading the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This expenditure included the construction of new railway track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">14 The second item was an amount of approximately $200 million on what was known as the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">This was a capital investment strategy for the improvement of NRC's competitiveness in rail freight on the east coast of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It was seen by NRC as an essential part of the establishment of an integrated national rail freight network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It involved the purchase of new locomotives and expansion of existing east coast terminals, including the AR terminal, to cater for the running of longer trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">15 Between May 1996 and March 1997, NRC and the respondent held negotiations for a long term lease of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The period of the lease, with options, would have provided for a tenure of 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The parties had not reached agreement on a number of essential terms of the lease by March 1997 when the negotiations ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">NRC conceded that the negotiations which took place up to that time were sincere and were conducted in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">16 On 27 March 1997, Mr O'Rourke wrote a significant letter to Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The letter stated that the respondent withdrew its "offer" of a 30 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Nevertheless, Mr O'Rourke stated that the respondent would negotiate in good faith an agreement to permit NRC to have access rights to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This was the first time in the course of the negotiations in 1996 to 1997 that the respondent put forward to NRC a proposal of access rights rather than a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The letter was referred to during the proceedings as the "change of position" letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">17 The substance of NRC's claim in estoppel is that NRC and the respondent each assumed, and mutually adopted an assumption, that long term control of the AR terminal was transferred to NRC in accordance with the EA in April 1993 and that this was to continue for so long as NRC conducted national interstate freight operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It was also said that NRC and the respondent mutually assumed that a long term lease of 20 to 30 years would be negotiated in order to facilitate the transfer of control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">NRC's case was that the terms of the lease were subsidiary to control of the AR terminal which passed to NRC in April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Other formulations of the estoppel claim were also pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">18 NRC was said to have acted to its detriment in reliance upon these assumptions by incurring the two significant categories of expenditure to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">NRC also submitted that it was induced by the assumptions to refrain from pursuing political solutions or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms which were available to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">NRC also contended that it would suffer "operational detriment", that is to say, adverse consequences for its rail freight operations in the ways set out at [867] --- [868] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">19 The change of position letter was submitted by NRC to have been an unconscionable departure from the assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, unlike most estoppel cases in which there is an unequivocal change of position that either is, or is not, unconscionable, these proceedings are complicated by the fact that the alleged departure from the assumption was accompanied by what amounted to an offer to compensate NRC for any detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The offer was to negotiate in good faith for access rights in lieu of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">20 Indeed, the offer of compensation for NRC's detriment did not stop with the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">There have been extensive communications between the parties since March 1997 which bear upon the question of whether any detriment to NRC has been met by offers to provide access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The respondent's most recent offer, made shortly before the commencement of the hearing, and amended during the course of the hearing, is a lengthy Draft Terminal Services Agreement which has not been accepted by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">21 Thus, whilst denying that NRC has made good the basal elements of its estoppel claim, the respondent points to the following proposition stated by McHugh J in Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (" Verwayen") at 501 as a complete answer to the claim:-
 
 "Once the detriment has ceased or been paid for, there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting on reverting to his or her former relationship with the other party and enforcing his or her strict legal rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">" 
 

22 NRC puts its claim under both s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") and estoppel but similar questions arise in each of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">23 NRC also claims that the respondent has engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of ss 51AA and 51AC of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">These claims turn largely upon strategies put forward by the respondent's middle management, in particular during 2001, for avoiding any obligations on the State of Queensland under the EA and for the use of the AR terminal as a "bargaining chip" in efforts by the respondent to enter interstate markets for the supply of rail freight services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">24 NRC's other major claim is that the respondent, by giving NRC a notice to quit the AR terminal and claiming possession of it under a cross-claim, has taken advantage of its market power for a proscribed purpose in contravention of s 46 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">25 This claim was influenced in part by the unique location of the AR terminal and the curious fact that railway track in Queensland is narrow gauge (3 foot 6 inches wide) whereas railway track on the east coast corridor is standard gauge (4 feet 81/2 inches wide).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">26 The AR terminal is located between the City of Brisbane and the Queensland/NSW border ("the border").</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Rail track from the border to the AR terminal is standard gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The respondent owns the track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">27 The rail track running north from the AR terminal to Cairns is narrow gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The respondent owns that track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">28 The AR terminal has standard gauge and narrow gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It also has dual gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The AR terminal is the only terminal in Queensland which is capable of servicing substantial volumes of interstate rail freight service into and out of Queensland between standard and narrow gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">29 There is standard gauge track from the AR terminal to the Fisherman Islands terminal at the Port of Brisbane (known as the Brisbane Multi-Modal terminal or "BMT") but that track does not extend further along the north coast line to far north Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">30 The AR terminal is therefore an ideal location for the trans-shipment of freight between northern Queensland and the southern states.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">31 The respondent is a vertically integrated rail operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It conducts "above rail" interstate passenger and freight services in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Since at least early 2005, it has conducted services between Queensland and the Southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It owns and operates all the "below rail" narrow gauge infrastructure north of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It also owns and operates the infrastructure comprising the standard gauge track in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">32 NRC contends that since at least 1995 there has been a market for the supply of narrow gauge railway track infrastructure services north of the AR terminal ("North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market") and a market for the supply of standard gauge railway track infrastructure services south of the AR terminal ("Standard Gauge Rail Infrastructure Market").</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">33 NRC also contends that QR has a substantial degree of power in each of those markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">34 NRC further contends that in seeking to resume control of the AR terminal and provide "mere" access rights to NRC, the respondent has taken advantage of its substantial degree of power in each of the infrastructure markets for the purpose of damaging NRC in its provision of rail linehaul services in two other markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">35 Those other markets are the supply of rail linehaul services on the north cost line between Brisbane and Cairns ("North Cost Rail Linehaul Market") and rail linehaul services on the east coast corridor ("East Coast Rail Linehaul Market").</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">36 NRC's claim under s 46 of the Act only bites if its estoppel claim fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That is to say, it proceeds on the basis that NRC has no legal or equitable right to a 30 year lease and that when the notice to quit was given NRC was in possession of the AR terminal as a month to month tenant holding over under an expired lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">37 It would be a false dichotomy to suggest that there is a distinction between taking advantage of market power and taking advantage of property rights: see NT Power Generation Pty Limited v Power and Water Authority [2004] HCA 48 ; (2004) 219 CLR 90 (" NT Power ") at [125].</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Property rights can be a source of market power attracting liability under s 46 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">38 Nevertheless, NRC's resort to s 46 to support its claim for a 30 year lease would appear to have startling consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It would seem to follow from NRC's contentions that an owner of property which is an essential input in a market can be compelled to give a competitor exclusive possession of the property, rather than mere access to it, thereby depriving the owner from having access to the property other than by an application pursuant to Part IIIA of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">39 Unfortunately, my reasons for judgment are long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The factual matrix covers a period of approximately 15 years from 1990 and culminates with the delivery by the respondent of its latest offer of access contained in the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement on 6 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">40 The principal witnesses were Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke, but the dramatis personae is large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">I attach to my judgment as Schedule 1 a dramatis personae
 
41 There were many acronyms and technical terms used to describe features of the rail infrastructure and rail linehaul markets to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I attach a list of acronyms at Schedule 2 and a glossary of terms at Schedule 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">42 NRC was privatised in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Its shares were purchased by a consortium owned by Toll Holdings Limited ("Toll") and Patrick Corporation Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The consortium completed the purchase of shares in NRC on 21 February 2002 and its name was thereafter changed to Pacific National (ACT) Limited ("PN").</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">So far as possible I will refer to the applicant as NRC in all communications and events up to 21 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I will endeavour to refer to it in all communications and events thereafter as PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">43 The respondent was established by the Government Owned Corporations (Queensland Rail) Regulation 1995 ("GOC Regulation") with effect from 1 July 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It is the successor in law to Queensland Railways: see s 14(1) of the GOC Regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">I will refer to the respondent as QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">For convenience it may sometimes be necessary to refer to Queensland Railways as QR but it is to be understood that a reference to "QR" in a communication or event prior to 1 July 1995 is to Queensland Railways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">44 QR has two cross-claims against PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The first is made pursuant to s 46 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is, in effect, that PN has taken advantage of a substantial degree of power in the Standard Gauge Rail Infrastructure Market, through its control of the AR terminal, to refuse a number of requests for access made by QR and another company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">It is contended that PN was motivated by an anti-competitive purpose proscribed by s 46 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">45 The second cross-claim made by QR is for possession of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If PN fails in its claim to an entitlement to a 30 year lease or to remain in control of the AR terminal then it would seem to follow that QR must be entitled to succeed in its claim for possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">QR would also succeed in its claim for, what may be described as statutory mesne profits under s 139 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) (" Property Law Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The claim is for rental being double the rent which would have been payable immediately before the notice to quit was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">PRELIMINARY MATTERS 
 The pleaded assumptions and the case sought to be made by PN at the trial 
 
46 I accept QR's submission that NRC's case suffers from the handicap of pleading multiple and conflicting assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">47 I also accept that only four of the pleaded assumptions have any bearing on the case conducted at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">These are that:-
 
 (1) QR would grant a lease or access to NRC of the AR terminal for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations in Queensland on a commercial basis, or for at least 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(2) QR would provide NRC with access to the AR terminal in a way which would enable NRC to have the greatest prospect of securing its commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">(3) QR would permit NRC to occupy the AR terminal and to have control of the management and operation for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations into Queensland, or for at least 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">(4) In 1993 QR transferred control of the AR terminal to NRC on the basis that the transfer would be effective for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight in Queensland, or for at least 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 
 
 

48 PN submitted that its case was not that QR promised NRC a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">That seems to be a disavowal of the first pleaded assumption set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Notwithstanding this, the four assumptions set out above reflect precisely what was pleaded in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">49 Ultimately, PN's case as pressed in final address was that NRC and QR mutually adopted an assumption that control of the AR terminal was transferred to NRC on 5 April 1993 pursuant to the EA, with no "sunset provision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">PN's case was that the question of the form of the property rights was merely "formal" and "ancillary" to the control which had already passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">50 The alleged assumption that control had passed for a period, which may have been in perpetuity, appears to have its foundation in the fourth of the pleaded assumptions set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The proposition that property rights were ancillary to control does not seem to have been pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In any event, for reasons given later, it has other difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The parties to these proceedings and the parties to the EA 
 
 

51 NRC was incorporated on 19 September 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">NRC was of course not a party to the EA but was established pursuant to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">52 The Commonwealth Government announced its intention to privatise NRC on 24 November 1996 but privatisation was not effected until February 2002 when the shares were sold to the Toll/Patrick consortium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">53 Queensland Railways was established under the Transport Infrastructure (Railways) Act 1991 (Qld) (" TIR Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The TIR Act provided that Queensland Railways' predecessor, the Commissioner of Railways, which was a corporation sole, was continued in existence under the name Queensland Railways: see s 4(1) of the TIR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">54 Queensland Railways was a legal entity, separate from the State of Queensland although it was an agency of the Queensland Government: see s 10(c) of the TIR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">55 Queensland Railways was not a party to the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The State of Queensland is not a party to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">56 Queensland Railways was dissolved by Reg 20(1) of the GOC Regulation, which established QR as its successor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">57 QR is a government owned corporation: see Reg 19(2) of the GOC Regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Its shares are held equally by the Queensland Treasurer and the Queensland Department of Transport (also referred to as "Queensland Transport" or "QT" in documents).</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">QR is not an agency of the Queensland Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The corporate state of mind of NRC 
 
58 In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Limited [1994] HCA 22 ; (1995) 183 CLR 563 at 582-3, the High Court approved the following statement of principle of Bright J in Brambles Holdings Limited v Carey (1976) 15 SASR 270 (" Brambles ") at 279:-
 
 "Always, when beliefs or opinions or states of mind are attributed to a company it is necessary to specify some person or persons so closely and relevantly connected with the company that the state of mind of that person or those persons can be treated as being identified with the company so that their state of mind can be treated as being the state of mind of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">" 
 

59 That is not to say that the state of mind to be attributed to a corporation must always be the state of mind of one particular officer: Brambles at 275 per Bray CJ; see also Wood v City of Melbourne (1979) 26 ALR 430 at 447.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">60 However, difficulties arise in ascertaining the state of mind of large corporations: Brambles at 275.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Different board members may hold different beliefs and it is sometimes possible to look beyond the resolutions of the board to the deliberations of individual board members as well as those of senior management: Ishac v David Securities Pty Limited (No 6) (1992) 7 ACSR 199 at 200-201 per Young J and the authorities there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">61 As Bray CJ said in Brambles at 276, a corporation cannot know or believe two contradictory things at once and it is rational belief, not schizophrenia which is to be attributed; see also Halsbury's Laws of Australia , Vol 7 Corporations at [120-3045].</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">62 Here, Mr Graham was "closely and relevantly connected" with all decisions taken by NRC in relation to the AR terminal during the period from about six months after the execution of the EA to 21 February 2002 when the shares were purchased by the Toll/Patrick consortium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">He was directly responsible for all dealings with respect to the AR terminal during that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">He made the decisions as to what steps should be taken and his recommendations to the Board were accepted by the Board members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">There was evidence, in general terms, from a number of Board members, Mr Butcher, Mr Moore-Wilton, Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh, that they relied on Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">63 Whether NRC's state of mind for the purpose of determining what, if any, assumptions were adopted, is confined to that of Mr Graham is not entirely clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">PN accepted in final address that Mr Graham's state of mind was "paramount".</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">But it submitted that Mr Butcher's assumptions were also relevant because of his regular discussions with Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Although PN called evidence from Mr Moore-Wilton, Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh, it did not submit that their states of mind were to be attributed to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">That is hardly surprising because their assumptions were different from Mr Graham's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">However, the same comment applies to Mr Butcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">64 Mr Graham did not assume that the State of Queensland or QR had any obligation in accordance with the EA to give NRC a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He believed that the State had a choice but that the minimum content of the State of Queensland's obligations under the EA was to provide access to NRC on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">65 Mr Butcher expected that NRC would receive a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">His understanding was based upon his knowledge of the EA but he did not appreciate that the State of Queensland had a discretion to provide access rather than ownership or a long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">His belief was also founded upon a conversation held in December 1991 with Mr Hamill, who was then the Minister for Transport of the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">66 Mr Moore-Wilton, Mr Stanko and Mrs Yeoh expected that NRC would have long term control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">They recognised that there would need to be a written agreement reached to give effect to the right of control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">67 PN also called evidence from Mr Hanscomb, a senior executive of NRC, who had, in 1991, assisted Mr Moore-Wilton on the Committee of Officials (which was a Committee established to examine options for the funding of NRC) and assisted in drafting the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">His expectation was that there would be a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I do not consider that his state of mind is to be attributed to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles .</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">His evidence has some bearing on Mr Graham's expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The corporate state of mind of QR 
 
 

68 Mr O'Rourke was the CEO of QR and its predecessor, Queensland Railways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">He was closely and relevantly connected with all dealings and decisions in respect of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">His state of mind can be treated as that of QR for the purpose of determining what assumptions QR held and he must be taken to have known what was in his mind as CEO of Queensland Railways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">69 The relevant period for determining on what assumptions QR acted and the conduct which is said to have induced NRC to act to its detriment is the period up to March 1997 or perhaps to the date of Mr O'Rourke's letter of 25 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The other relevant mind of QR in that period was Mr Hearsch.</sentence>

<sentence id="s179">THE FACTUAL MATRIX 
 Background to the establishment of NRC: The Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement 
 
70 Most of the background to the establishment of NRC is taken from the Report of the National Freight Initiative ("NFI") dated 20 July 1990 and the Report of the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force dated 21 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">71 In 1989-90 Australia's interstate rail freight operations incurred an estimated combined loss of $377m.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Losses of this magnitude were a recurring feature of the interstate rail freight business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Contributions to the losses varied between different operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">72 By 1990, governments, industry and the community were no longer prepared to accept these losses and the impositions they placed on the Australian economy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">73 In October 1989, the NFI began to evaluate options for a viable interstate national railway freight business under single management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The NFI was formed by representatives of five government owned railways, the ACTU, BHP, three major freight forwarders and Mr EWA Butcher ("Mr Butcher") representing the Commonwealth Minister for Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">74 The objectives of the NFI were to formulate a proposal for the establishment of an efficient national rail freight enterprise providing profitable and competitive interstate services, and thereby to realise gains in economic efficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">75 The NFI recommended the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation ("NRFC") with Commonwealth and State equity participation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">76 The NFI Report contained the following useful diagram of the proposed national rail freight network, showing inter alia, the terminals and marshalling yards proposed to be under NRFC control:-
 
 
 
77 The NFI's proposal called for an incorporated company integrated across State borders operating at cost levels significantly below those under the then existing fragmented rail systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">78 A table to the NFI Report listed the main assets owned by rail systems which were used to operate the interstate freight business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The following appeared under the heading "Terminals":-
 
 "Queensland Railways ... Acacia Ridge (Part)" 
 

79 The reference to "part" was apparently to the interstate intermodal terminal which is the portion of the AR terminal that is the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">80 The NFI considered that it was "especially important that the NRFC control all of the terminal facilities it needed to conduct its business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The NFI also stated that the NRFC should control its own operations within freight terminals, that is, shunting, transfers, material handling and documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">81 At a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council on 7 September 1990, Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers agreed to establish an independent task force ("the Task Force") to be responsible for developing detailed proposals on a wide range of issues relevant to the establishment of a "fully commercial" NRFC which would operate interstate rail freight services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">82 The Task Force comprised the representatives of the governments of the Commonwealth, NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia as well as representatives of the ACTU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Mr Butcher was the Commonwealth's representative and the chairman of the Task Force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">83 The Task Force issued a report on 21 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Prior to that date, on 31 October 1990, the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth the States and Territories, signed an historic agreement entitled "Heads of Government Agreement on the National Rail Freight Corporation" ("Heads of Government Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The signatories included RJL Hawke for the Commonwealth and Wayne Goss for the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">84 The Heads of Government Agreement provided that the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments agreed to establish an NRFC for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations with a view to it commencing business on 1 July 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">85 The various governments agreed under the Heads of Government Agreement that the proposed NRFC would:-
 
 &#8226; involve Commonwealth, State and Territory equity participation in a company incorporated under the Companies Code;
 &#8226; encompass all the railways' existing interstate freight business; and
 &#8226; have a corporate goal to earn a commercial rate of return on its assets without reliance on government guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">

86 The Heads of Government Agreement also provided that the governments agreed that their positions on equity participation and commitment of assets to NRFC would be subject to their consideration of proposals and recommendations to be made by the Task Force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">87 A number of broad conditions were recognised by the governments in the Heads of Government Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">They included that the NRFC should be established and operate on a strictly commercial basis with a financially viable corporate plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">88 The conditions also included the following:-
 
 "the NRFC shall have access (by ownership or other appropriate arrangements) to assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">" 
 

89 Nearly two weeks earlier, on 19 October 1990, Mr O'Rourke, who was then the Commissioner of Railways, wrote a memorandum to the Director-General of the Queensland Department of Transport expressing Queensland Rail's support for the establishment of NRFC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The memorandum pointed to consequential benefits for QR including elimination of losses on QR's interstate standard gauge rail operations to the border, the possibility of increased traffic on the North Coast line and the improved chance of obtaining Commonwealth funding for the standard gauge connections from Acacia Ridge to Fisherman Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">90 The Task Force Report stated that the fundamental question it was required to address was whether or not the NRFC could be commercially viable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">It said that its analysis suggested that the NRFC was a marginal prospect commercially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Nevertheless, it said that the NRFC was a considerable improvement over separate interstate rail freight systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">It also said that analysis suggested that NRFC "can be commercially viable" after an establishment phase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">91 The Task Force considered that improvements in productivity and operational efficiency were crucial to NRFC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">It said that these improvements required investment in infrastructure, communications and rolling stock as well as changes in work practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">92 The Task Force proposed:-
 
 "... that the NRFC be incorporated on 1 July 1991 and take over all the major capital city interstate rail freight terminals , with effect from 1 October 1991 ..." (emphasis added) 


 
93 One of the reasons for this recommendation was that, as the Task Force observed, terminals are critical because they are the main point of contact with customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">94 The Task Force considered that equity shares for NRFC during its establishment phase (which was thought to be 1992 to 1996) should be, Commonwealth 34%, NSW 29%, Victoria 19%, Western Australia 16% and Queensland 2%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">95 The Task Force also considered that there was a requirement during the establishment phase that NRFC receive financial assistance from its shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">This was because NRFC would be taking over five loss making businesses and would be handicapped by past and prospective losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">96 Bankers' Trust Corporate Finance ("BT") was appointed by the Task Force to assess the commercial viability of NRFC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">BT examined anticipated profits and losses over a 15 year period under a number of different assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">It is unnecessary to set out the four scenarios posited in BT's calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Queensland Cabinet considers benefits of establishing NRFC 
 
97 In a cabinet memorandum apparently dated 15 June 1991, Mr Hamill, who was then the Queensland Minister for Transport, set out a number of issues flowing from the proposed establishment of the NRFC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">He referred to the proposed execution of the EA which is detailed below, and said:-
 
 "...</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In terms of assets Queensland will be expected to transfer control of both the interstate portion of the Acacia Ridge freight terminal and the interstate rail corridor between Acacia Ridge and the New South Wales border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">" 
 

98 Mr Hamill's memorandum also pointed to the benefits for the State of Queensland of being a party to the EA without being a shareholder in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">They included reduction of losses on interstate rail freight as a result of the NRFC attaining the "performance levels" contemplated by the Task Force Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">99 Two options were proposed by Mr Hamill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The first was that Queensland take equity by transferring control of the required interstate assets to the NRFC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The second was that Queensland have no equity but still transfer control of the relevant assets to the NRFC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In exchange, Queensland would approach the Commonwealth to waive all present and future obligations associated with those assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">100 On 1 July 1991, the Queensland Cabinet decided that it favoured the State having no equity participation in NRFC but:-
 
 "Cabinet considered that Queensland should transfer control of its relevant interstate rail assets to the NRC (to facilitate the establishment of the NRC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">" 


 The Establishment Agreement 
 
101 By an agreement made on 30 July 1991 between the Commonwealth and the States of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, the parties agreed to incorporate a public company, having as a principal objective the carriage of interstate rail freight on a national network: see cl 4(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">South Australia acceded to, and became a party to the EA later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">102 Under the EA, the Commonwealth, the State of NSW, the State of Victoria and the State of Western Australia agreed to become shareholders of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Those States were defined as "the States".</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The State of Queensland did not agree to become a shareholder but provision was made for it to become a shareholder in due course, if it elected to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The State of Queensland was defined as the "Other State" and was included within the description "the Other States".</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">103 The States and the Other States had different rights and obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">These included the right to appoint directors and the obligation to subscribe funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Each of the States had that right and that obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Other States did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">104 Nevertheless, each of the States and the Other States agreed under the EA to cause their respective rail authorities to transfer ownership, give leases or grant access in respect of assets owned or controlled by those rail authorities and used by them in connection with interstate rail freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">I will set out those provisions in some detail later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">105 The EA commenced by reciting that in order to achieve micro-economic reform in the Australian rail industry the Commonwealth, the State and Territory governments had agreed that a company should be established for the purpose of conducting rail freight operations on a commercial basis compatible with the principles set out in the Heads of Government Agreement: see Recital A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">106 Those principles were stated in Recital B which included the following:-
 
 "(a) that the Company will:- 
 
 
 
 (i) operate on a strictly commercial basis, with a financially viable corporate plan, and be subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Commonwealth) 
 (ii) have access (by ownership or other appropriate arrangements) to the assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability; 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (v) provide access on a commercial basis to the NRC network and to terminal facilities for private and public sector operators; 
 
 
 
 ..." 
 

107 The Commonwealth, the States and the Other States agreed to take all practical steps to seek the enactment of legislation by their respective Parliaments to approve the EA and to provide for its implementation: see cl 3(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">108 Clause 4(1), to which I referred above, contained the agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Other States for the establishment of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Clause 4(1)(b) provided for it to be incorporated under the name "National Rail Corporation Limited".</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">109 Clause 4(2) provided for the Commonwealth to subscribe for ordinary and convertible shares in NRC and for it to transfer specified numbers of those shares to each of the States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">110 Appointment of directors was dealt with in cl 4(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">During the Establishment Period, which was the five year period commencing on the date of commencement of operations of NRC, there were to be nine directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Three were to be nominated by the Commonwealth, with one to be Chairperson of the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Two directors were to be nominated by each of the States of NSW, Victoria and one by the State of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The remaining director, who was to be the Managing Director, was to be appointed by the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Mr Butcher was subsequently appointed to be the Chairman and Mr Graham to be Managing Director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">111 If any Other State became a shareholder during the Establishment Period, it had the right to nominate one director: see cl 4(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">112 Clause 5(1) bound the Commonwealth and the States, to the extent they were able, to procure NRC to, inter alia, commence and conduct national interstate rail freight operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Their obligations included procuring NRC to:-
 
 "take over progressively from the rail authorities of the Commonwealth and the States, in whole or in part, functions of the type listed in Schedule 2 and the management of the associated assets pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the agreements entered into pursuant to subclauses 5(3), 5(4) and 5(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">" 
 

113 The functions listed in Schedule 2 included the operation of interstate rail freight terminals and freight terminal management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">114 Clause 5(2) excepted the Other States from the obligation to procure NRC to take over the operations and management of interstate rail freight terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The clause provided as follows:-
 
 "The Commonwealth, the States and the other States will, and will cause their respective rail authorities to assist the Company, when requested by the Company, to undertake the matters set out in subclause 5(1), except in the case of the other States, in relation to the matters set out in paragraph 5(1)(f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">" 
 

115 Clause 5(3) provided that, prior to and during the Transition Period, that is the first three year period from the commencement of operations of NRC, the Commonwealth and the States would cause their respective rail authorities to enter into contracts with NRC for the provision of interstate rail freight services to the NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The means by which the price of the services was to be determined was set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">116 Clause 5(4) dealt with the transfer of functions from the Commonwealth and the States to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">It provided that the Commonwealth and the States would cause their respective rail authorities to permit NRC to assume performance of the functions related to interstate rail freight of the type listed in Schedule 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">117 The obligations of the Commonwealth and the States to transfer ownership, give leases or grant access to assets of their rail authorities was contained in cl 5(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">It provided relevantly:-
 
 "The Commonwealth and the States shall, or shall cause their rail authorities to transfer ownership of, or for as long as the Company continues to conduct national interstate rail freight operations, give leases of, or grant access to the Company, in relation to any asset, owned or controlled by the Commonwealth or the State or their rail authorities, and used by their rail authorities in connection with interstate rail freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The Company, in its Corporate Plan, shall identify that a particular asset or class of assets is required by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The Commonwealth and the States shall have a discretion whether to transfer ownership, give a lease or grant access to the Company in relation to any asset required by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Transfer of ownership, lease or grant of access shall be given within a reasonable time following the request by the Company to make the asset available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The objective is that all transfers of ownership, leases or grants of access shall be completed before the end of the Transition Period.</sentence>

118 Clause 5(5) went on, in paragraphs (a) to (d) to set out detailed provisions for the implementation of the specified obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Clause 5(5)(b) provided that where the Commonwealth or a Sate did not agree to transfer ownership or enter into a long lease of an asset, the predominant use of which was for interstate rail freight, NRC would be granted access to the asset pursuant to a contract, the terms and conditions of which would be agreed between the NRC and the Commonwealth or the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">119 The obligation of the Other States to transfer ownership, give leases or grant access to assets used by their rail authorities in interstate rail freight was contained in cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">It provided:-
 
 "The other States shall, or shall cause their rail authorities to transfer ownership of, or for as long as the Company continues to conduct national interstate rail freight operations, give leases of, or grant access to the Company, in relation to any asset, owned or controlled by the other States or their rail authorities, and used by their rail authorities in connection with interstate rail freight.</sentence>

120 Clause 5(6)(b) provided that until all the transfers of ownership, leases or grants of access under cl 5(6)(a) were completed, the Other States would, or would cause their rail authorities to, enter into contracts with NRC for the provision of interstate rail freight services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The means by which the price for those services was to be determined was set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">121 Clause 6 dealt with funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It also made provision for the Other States to become shareholders, with the consequent obligation to provide equity funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The mechanism for an Other State to become a shareholder was easier depending upon whether it elected to do so during the Transition Period or the Establishment Period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">122 Clause 6(1) specified the initial equity funds which the Commonwealth and the States were bound to contribute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The amounts were $295.8 million for the Commonwealth, $75.6 million for NSW, $35.1 million for Victoria and $8 million for Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Provision was made for each of those polities to subscribe for convertible shares in NRC in amounts equal to the respective amounts of the initial funding obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">123 The Commonwealth and the States also agreed to contribute additional equity funding during the Establishment Period in accordance with their respective proportionate shares specified in cl 6(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">124 Clause 6(3) to 6(7) made provision for the calculation of the number of ordinary and convertible shares to be issued to the Commonwealth and the States by reference to the value of assets transferred to NRC by way of ownership or long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">125 Clause 6(8) made provision for the admission of the Other States as shareholders during the Transition Period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">An Other State which elected to become a shareholder during that period was required to contribute a minimum of $5 million in cash for shares and the Commonwealth and the States were bound to pass a resolution for the issue of the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The Other State was also then bound to contribute additional equity funding in such proportion as was agreed between the Commonwealth and the States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">126 If an Other State gave notice that it wished to become a shareholder during the last two years of the Establishment Period, the Commonwealth and the States were granted a discretion to pass a resolution for the issue of the shares on such terms and conditions as agreed between themselves and the Other State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">127 If an Other State gave notice after the Establishment Period, it was given the right to purchase shares on the same terms as were offered to third parties: cl 6(10).</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">128 Provision was made in cl 7 for alternative dispute resolution by conciliation or arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Disputes were defined to include disputes or differences as to the charges and terms and conditions for access to assets pursuant to cl 5(5)(a),(b),(c) and (d) and cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>

 The National Rail Corporation (Agreement) Act 1991 (Qld) 
 
133 In accordance with its obligations under cl 3(1) of the EA, the State of Queensland enacted the National Rail Corporation (Agreement) Act 1991 (Qld) (" NRC Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">134 In his Second Reading Speech on the introduction of the National Rail Corporation (Agreement) Bill on 26 November 1991, Mr Hamill said that the State of Queensland would not become a shareholder in NRC but that it assisted in its formation and would transfer "relevant interstate rail assets to the corporation on a long-term lease basis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">135 The NRC Act provides in s 5 that the EA is approved.</sentence>

 "It is expected that NRC will want to takeover terminal operations as early as possible but it will be in its financial interests to defer this takeover of functions for 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">" 
 

142 The reason why the 12 month deferral was said to be in NRC's interests was explained later in the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">It was related to the provision in the EA for pricing of services under cl 5(6)(b) of the EA pending the transfer of ownership or leases or grant of access rights.</sentence>

<sentence id="s317">The issues paper commented that "[a] short term lease is suggested here to encourage NRC to relocate to Acacia Ridge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">145 The memorandum of 6 August 1991 and its attachments were acknowledged by Mr O'Rourke to have been part of the serious planning work by QR officers concerning the transfer of interstate rail freight in Queensland to NRC.</sentence>

<sentence id="s321">147 The minutes of the first meeting of the Steering Committee, held on 15 August 1991, stated that the General Manager, Express Freight, Mr PJ Case would proceed to investigate and arrange for the transfer of interstate freight terminal functions to NRC and liaise with NRC about timing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It was noted in the minutes that Mr Case would shortly assume responsibility for operations at AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">148 The minutes also record a decision that QR should aim to have the lease of interstate freight terminals and the track from the border tunnel to Acacia Ridge in place by the date of commencement of operations by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">This was to ensure that QR had no responsibility for costs or functions after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">149 The Steering Committee established a working group to address all issues affecting freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Mr Case was appointed as Chair of the working group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">He sent a memorandum dated 19 August 1991 to other members of the working group proposing a meeting on 2 September 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The other members of the working group included Mr Price and Mr Eades, the General Manager, Property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">150 An attachment to the memorandum of 19 August 1991 recorded a statement that it was doubtful whether NRC would be in a position to assume responsibility for standard gauge operations in Queensland on 1 February 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">How long QR would continue to carry out those functions under contract to NRC was not then known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">151 The second meeting of the Steering Committee was held on 10 September 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Mr Case reported on the progress of the working group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">He reported a number of decisions taken by the working group in relation to "lease arrangements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The decisions included that the lease was to relate to the AR terminal and the corridor between AR and the border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Also, a lease valuation was to be carried out to facilitate negotiations with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">152 On 11 September 1991, Mr Tony Drake, Group General Manager, Corporate Services, who was a member of the Steering Committee, sent a memorandum to Mr Eades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Copies of the memorandum were sent to Mr Hearsch and Mr Case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The memorandum stated that a number of decisions had been taken at a recent Steering Committee meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">These included:-
 
 &#8226; the lease was to cover the AR terminal, with the exact boundaries to be determined by Mr Case, and south to the border encompassing "the normal rail right of way", but excluding adjoining lands;
 &#8226; the agreement should provide that Queensland Rail could also construct rail facilities within the same corridor;
 &#8226; the lease rental should be for an initial three years with subsequent reappraisal; and
 &#8226; the initial lease rental should cover costs and outgoings with no return on asset values.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">

153 Mr Eades was also requested in the memorandum of 11 September 1991 to come up with a notional value of AR and the right of way to the border in case that was needed for negotiations with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">154 NRC was incorporated on 19 September 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">NRC's Articles of Association provided that during the Establishment Period there was no right to transfer shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">After the Establishment Period there were pre-emptive rights in favour of existing shareholders on the transfer of shares to third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">155 There were further meetings of the working group in 1991 and 1992 to discuss progress of the various issues to be dealt with in connection with the transfer of responsibility of interstate freight to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">156 On 7 November 1991, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Butcher recommending a number of items of capital expenditure or "deferred maintenance" for NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">He commented that previously QR had provided insufficient resources for these "essential investments" and that this was "a clear example of why we had to have an NRC!".</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">157 On 13 December 1991, there was a meeting of QR's Steering Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Mr Case put forward at the meeting a draft position paper on the transfer of interstate freight to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The position paper was marked "draft for discussion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">158 Mr Case's draft position paper referred, under the heading of "Contractual/Legal Requirements" to the complexities of rail reserves for which QR did not have clear legal title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Difficulties were envisaged in providing NRC with quiet possession of those areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Developing survey plans was thought to be impracticable at that stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">159 The draft position paper proposed that a Heads of Agreement form the basis of the NRC business in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">"Running licences" were to be developed for NRC's operational requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Mr Case said that these would guarantee NRC access to the various business areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Running licences were proposed for areas including the following:-
 
 " - Border tunnel to Acacia Ridge 
 - Acacia Ridge (defined area)" 
 

160 NRC produced its first corporate plan on 1 April 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The corporate plan identified terminal management at AR as a function or asset to be transferred to NRC during the first year of the Transition Period under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">161 On 23 April 1992, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke informing him that NRC's first corporate plan was expected to be sent to shareholders early in the following month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Mr Graham noted that included in the corporate plan, as required by the EA, was a nomination of functions and assets to be transferred to NRC and a proposed timetable for those transfers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">162 Mr Graham also stated that there would be a substantial amount of clarification and negotiation to be undertaken between NRC and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">He asked Mr O'Rourke to give consideration to nomination of a negotiating team.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">He said that some of the issues may require discussion with the Queensland government and that he had no objection to a government representative being involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">163 On 1 July 1992, Mr RG Hartley, the Acting Director-General of the Queensland Department of Transport, wrote to Mr Graham about the division of responsibilities between the Queensland Government and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Mr Hartley stated that, as discussions and negotiations develop between NRC and the Queensland Government and its agencies, it was appropriate to provide Mr Graham with "formal advice" on the relevant contact officer for "NRC matters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">164 Mr Hartley indicated that the Policy &amp; Planning Unit of the Department of Transport would handle all "policy issues" such as the State of Queensland becoming a shareholder in NRC and the overall progress of the standard gauge rail link to the Port of Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The name of a contact officer, Mr J Noye, was supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">165 Mr Hartley also stated in the letter that QR would handle all "operational rail issues" and the detailed negotiations on those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">He said he did not expect there to be operational issues which could not be resolved between NRC and QR but, if a difficulty arose, NRC was to contact Mr Noye who would arrange for the issue to be raised with the Director General and the Minister for Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">166 Mr Hartley's letter concluded by stating that the State of Queensland was looking forward to becoming a shareholder in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">167 On 10 July 1992, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke informing him that NRC's first corporate plan was approved by its shareholders on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The letter invited Mr O'Rourke to attend a meeting in Sydney on 20 July 1992 at which NRC would make a presentation on two matters; firstly, service contracts for the supply of rail services to NRC during the transition period, and secondly, the transfer of functions and selected assets from "the authorities" to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">168 Mr Case attended the presentation made by NRC on 20 July 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">He reported on it to Mr Hearsch in a memorandum of the same date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The memorandum stated that Mr Affleck of NRC put forward a proposal to progress negotiations with QR on the two matters referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">169 Mr Case's memorandum referred to NRC's proposed timetable which included the formation of three joint working parties to progress transfer of functions, identification of assets and service agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">He said that NRC would prefer to have a common Heads of Agreement for the service contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">He also said that the transfer of functions and assets must be completed by the end of the Transition Period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">170 On 28 July 1992, Mr Butcher sent a letter to Mr Hamill referring to a recent indication by Mr Hamill that Queensland was considering taking up equity in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Butcher noted that once funding became available, NRC was willing to recommend to the Commonwealth Minister for Land and Transport that he approve $30 million go towards the construction of standard gauge access at Fisherman Islands, subject to QR and NRC agreeing to the provision by QR to NRC of rail access from the AR terminal to Fisherman Islands for 25 years in particular terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">171 During July 1992, BHP Engineering Pty Limited was awarded a consultancy brief to prepare a Master Plan for NRC's intermodal container terminals around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">A Master Plan strategy for AR was produced in November 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">It included a proposal for the construction of Track A, to be 1,200 metres long, with construction to be completed by the end of June 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">172 On 20 January 1993, Mr Hamill wrote to Mr Butcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Mr Hamill made reference to a draft Rail Freight Service Agreement which had been submitted by NRC to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">He went on to refer to the potential for Queensland to become a shareholder in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">He said that this was dependent upon NRC contributing $10 million to the establishment of a standard gauge link to Fisherman Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Mr Hamill sought clarification of NRC's intentions regarding the contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">173 On 2 February 1993, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">The letter commenced by thanking QR for the cooperative manner in which negotiations for the Rail Freight Services Agreement had been conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The letter included the following:-
 
 "The main purpose of this letter is to make you aware of the next step we wish to take to put in place the transfer of terminal operating functions, which has been mentioned in earlier correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">As discussed with your officers, it will be necessary for National Rail and Queensland Rail to negotiate a formal agreement to provide a framework within which we can operate the intermodal freight terminal at Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Fred Affleck and Simon Hanscomb will be contacting Peter Case in the next few days to commence this process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">" 
 

174 The letter of 2 February 1993 also noted that the scheduled date for transfer of AR to NRC Management Control was 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Mr Graham said that in order to achieve this, it would be necessary to complete negotiation of a terminal operating agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">175 As part of the planned handover, a meeting took place on 25 February 1993 between NRC and QR executives, as well as officers of the State Rail Authority of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The NRC executives included Mr Fullerton and Mr Hanscomb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The QR executives included Mr Case and Mr Eades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">176 The written notes of the meeting record that the boundaries of the AR terminal and the handover point for NRC trains were still to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">177 On 4 March 1993, Mr Hamill met with Mr Butcher, Mr Graham, Mr O'Rourke, Mr Hartley and two other persons from Mr Hamill's office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">There was a discussion about the issue of NRC's proposed $10 million contribution to the construction of the standard gauge rail link to Fisherman Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">178 A confidential written note of the meeting recorded that Mr Butcher and Mr Graham made it clear that NRC was prepared to honour its "original intent" to make the $10 million contribution but that this was dependent upon Queensland Rail taking up shares in NRC, and:-
 
 "the 'packaging' of that $10 million may need to be reviewed, in order that the NRC executives be seen to honour its fiduciary responsibilities under the Companies Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">" 
 

179 On 12 March 1993, NRC's Corporate Services Manager, Mr Simon Hanscomb, wrote to Mr Case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">He referred to Mr Graham's letter of 2 February 1993 concerning the transfer to NRC of interstate rail freight functions under the EA and, in particular, the transfer of terminal operating functions to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">180 Mr Hanscomb stated that meetings had been held between the "operations people" of NRC and QR to determine and, where possible, to progress various issues including the terminal area to be controlled by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">181 The letter of 12 March 1993 is important and I will set out the relevant parts of it in full as follows:-
 
 "The Company proposes to give legal effect to the terminal take up by: 
 
 
 i. a letter setting out the specific functions the Company will assume from 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">
 ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">two commercial leases, one covering plant and equipment and the other land and buildings under which the Company would pay a fair market rent for land and buildings and an annual percentage of the value of plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">
 
 
 ... 
 The leases are to be framed so as to make it explicit that they do not represent a lease for the purposes of asset transfer, lease or access within the meaning of clause 5(5) or clause 5(6) of the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">This approach has been specifically adopted to enable the broader issue of asset transfer etc to be determined at a later date after full and proper consideration by both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">
 
 The separate leases for land and buildings, and plant and equipment are to enable the final resolution of asset transfer issues to occur independently for each class of asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">
 
 Please find attached a discussion draft of both lease agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">... 
 
 To assist National Rail in progressing the documentation it would be appreciated if you could: 
 
 &#8226; review the attached list of title references and advise whether it is complete or not with regard to your intermodal terminal &#8226; advise particulars of any encumbrances affecting the property, in particular could you please supply a list of tenancies including leases or licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">
 
 ... 
 As the deadline set for terminal takeover is rapidly approaching I would appreciate it if you could give these matters your early attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">" (emphasis added)
 

182 On 22 March 1993, Mr Hanscomb forwarded to Mr Case and two other QR executives a further draft of the leases for the AR terminal and for plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">183 The draft agreement for lease contained a recital that the parties had agreed that the function of operating the interstate rail freight terminal at AR would be transferred to NRC from the commencement of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It also contained a recital that the parties had agreed that for the purpose of undertaking its functions, NRC would be entitled to occupy the terminal and to use the assets and infrastructure associated with it on the terms set out in the agreement but on the basis that the leases were not to be taken as an exercise of or extinguishment of any right under cl 5(6) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">184 Clause 7 of the draft terminal lease provided that the lease would continue until the first to occur of:-
 
 &#8226; the expiration of a period of three years from the date of commencement; and
 &#8226; the date on which NRC acquires ownership or is granted a lease or access rights to the AR terminal in accordance with cl 5(6) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">
 2 April 1993: Railway Freight Services Agreement 
 
185 On 2 April 1993 NRC and QR entered into the Railway Freight Services Agreement ("1993 Freight Services Agreement") under which QR agreed to provide rail services to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Although the 1993 Freight Services Agreement purports to have been made pursuant to cl 5(3) of the EA, this would seem to be a mistaken reference to cl 5(6)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Thus, the purpose of the 1993 Freight Services Agreement was for QR to provide interstate freight services pending the transfer of assets or other grant of rights contemplated by cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">186 Clause 2 of the 1993 Freight Services Agreement stated that in accordance with the EA, NRC would progressively assume responsibility for interstate rail freight consigned by QR's customers and progressively establish and expand NRC's own business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Clause 2 also stated that NRC's progressive assumption of responsibilities would be effected in accordance with a timetable to be developed co-operatively between NRC and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">187 The 1993 Freight Services Agreement applied to any interstate terminal in the State of Queensland, the management or operation of which had not been transferred to NRC in accordance with the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">It therefore applied to AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">188 Clause 6 of the 1993 Freight Services Agreement stated that QR would provide NRC with a specified range of terminal services to ensure that freight was properly handled and shipped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">4 April 1993: The Heads of Agreement and the Functions Letter 
 
189 On 4 April 1993, NRC and QR entered into Heads of Agreement for the assumption by NRC of management and operational control of the AR terminal ("4 April 1993 Heads").</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The 4 April 1993 Heads were in the form of a letter from NRC signed by Mr Graham on behalf of NRC and by Mr Eades on behalf of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">190 The letter commenced with the words "(t)o facilitate the assumption of functions referred to in my letter of the same date ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">This was a reference to the "functions letter" to which I will refer below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">191 The 4 April 1993 Heads provided for NRC to enter into possession of the AR terminal as identified in an attached plan ("1993 lease area") pending execution of a lease over the 1993 lease area ("1993 real estate lease") and a lease of plant and equipment at the terminal ("1993 plant lease").</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">192 The effect of the 4 April 1993 Heads was that QR agreed to enter into the 1993 real estate lease and the 1993 plant lease substantially in the form of annexures to a negotiation draft of those respective leases dated 4 April 1993 ("negotiation draft").</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">It was a term of the 4 April 1993 Heads that NRC and QR would enter into the formal leases within a period of 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">193 The 4 April 1993 Heads provided that NRC's use of occupation of the 1993 lease area was to be at a fair market rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">It acknowledged that the final area to be leased was subject to survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">The plan which comprised the 1993 lease area, as contained in the 4 April 1993 Heads, was as follows:-
 
 
 
194 It is difficult to decipher the principle features of the local area from the plan, but I will describe them briefly:
 
 &#8226; The area of the land to be leased to NRC comprises approximately 202,000 square metres; 
 &#8226; The area included various lengths of railway track, referred to in the industry as "roads".</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">These included Interstate Mainline track ("Mainline track") and the marshalling yards, which include six "roads" know as New Crane Roads 1 to 6 ("NC1" to "NC6").</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The marshalling yards were used for shunting and reconfiguring trains; 
 &#8226; There is a rail mounted gantry which straddles NC1 to NC3 and enables loading and unloading of trains on those roads;
 &#8226; Entry to the leased area is via Kerry Road and a private road at the end of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">A building known as the Administration Building was located near the junction of the terminal entrance and the Mainline track;
 &#8226; Another track known as Track A was constructed by NRC during the term of its lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">That track ran parallel to the Mainline track and was close to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">&#8226; There were a number of roads going off the leased area to private sidings located to the east of the leased area (sidings are a term used in the industry to describe a short section of railroad track connected by switches with a main track);
 &#8226; Further to the east was a separate narrow gauge terminal owned by QR and known as the Q-link terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">The northern end of the Mainline track is generally called the Northern Shunting neck.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The southern area is at the Beaudesert Road end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">&#8226; The concrete areas, adjoining in particular Track A and the Mainline track, are known as hardstand areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">&#8226; I will attach, as Attachment A, a plan prepared by QR for the purposes of these proceedings and admitted into evidence without objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">It provides a useful depiction of these principle features of the area which I have described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">

195 The parties agreed in the 4 April 1993 Heads that pending the execution of the first form of the 1993 real estate lease and the 1993 plant lease, the provisions of the annexures to the negotiation draft would apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">196 The negotiation draft recited that the EA provided for the Commonwealth and the States (including the State of Queensland) to cause their respective rail authorities to transfer ownership of, or give leases or grant access to NRC to assets owned or controlled by them or their rail authorities and used in connection with interstate rail freight in accordance with the principles set out in cl 5(6) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">197 The negotiation draft also recited that:-
 
 "The parties have further agreed that, for the purpose of undertaking its functions, NRC will be entitled to occupy the Terminal and to use the assets and infrastructure associated therewith on the terms set out in this Agreement, but on the basis that this Agreement and any lease entered in accordance with it are not to be taken as an exercise or extinguishment of any right under clause 5(6) of the Shareholders Agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">" (emphasis added)
 

198 Clause 4.3 of the negotiation draft specifically provided that nothing in the Agreement for lease or the annexed form of leases constituted an exercise of the rights or fulfilment of the obligations under cl 5(6) of the EA and all such rights and obligations were expressly preserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">199 The negotiation draft defined the "terminal" to mean the land identified in the attached plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">This appears to be the plan of the 1993 lease area shown at [193].</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">200 Provision was made in the negotiation draft for determination of the fair market rental value by agreement between the parties or, failing agreement, by the appointment of a valuer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">201 Annexure A to the negotiation draft was the draft 1993 real estate lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">It did not contain a description of the land but the effect of the agreement between the parties was that the land was to be the 1993 lease area, which would be subject to final survey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">202 Clause 7.2 of Annexure A provided for the 1993 real estate lease to continue until the first to occur of:-
 
 
 "(a) the expiration of a period of 3 years from the date of commencement of this Lease; and 
 (b) the date on which the Company acquires ownership or is granted a lease or access rights to the property in accordance with clause 5(6) of the Shareholders Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">" 
 
 

203 NRC was to be permitted to hold over after the expiration of the term for a maximum of six months: see cl 7.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">204 Upon the expiration of the term or the holding over period NRC was required to demolish or remove any structure on the land unless NRC acquired ownership or was given a lease or granted access: see cl 12.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">There was a similar provision in cl 14.2 for the removal of fittings, furniture, plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">205 Clause 26.1 provided that:-
 
 "Nothing in this Lease affects the obligations of the Rail Authority [(QR)] under the Shareholders' Agreement or the Railway Freight Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">" 
 

206 Upon the expiration of the term referred to in cl 7.2, subject to a maximum holding over of six months, NRC was required to give possession to QR: see cl 27.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">207 It is unnecessary to refer to the terms of the draft 1993 plant lease in Annexure B to the negotiation draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">208 Contemporaneously with the execution of the 4 April 1993 Heads, Mr Graham wrote a letter to Mr O'Rourke setting out the functions which NRC would assume on the following day ("functions letter").</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The functions letter stated that its purpose was to formally notify QR that NRC would, in accordance with the EA, assume responsibility for the management and operation of the AR terminal on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">209 The various functions for which NRC was to assume responsibility were specified in schedules to the functions letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">They included operation of all lifting equipment, site security arrangements, maintenance and all "administrative and customer interface functions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">210 NRC commenced interstate freight operations in Queensland on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Mr Eades reported this fact in a memorandum to Mr O'Rourke, Mr Hearsch and Mr Case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Copies were sent to Mr Drake and to the Manager of Legal Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">211 Mr Eades reported that he had signed the necessary documents to allow NRC to assume operations and that he had done so with the consent of Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Mr Eades stated that the documents which were applicable to QR's relationship with NRC were:-
 
 &#8226; the EA, under which QR (rather than the State of Queensland) was said to be "an Other state";
 &#8226; the State NRC legislation, which was apparently a reference to the NRC Act ;
 &#8226; "a service agreement signed on 2 April 1993", which was a reference to the 1993 Freight Services Agreement; and
 &#8226; the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">

212 Mr Eades pointed out in the memorandum that the 4 April 1993 Heads referred to "subsequent documents" which would come into effect after an initial 90 day licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">These documents were the 1993 real estate lease and the 1993 plant lease, in the form of the drafts attached to the negotiation draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">213 Mr Eades noted that during the 90 day period detailed work would need to be done to determine whether:-
 
 "the current licensed area including the building, car park, shunting, necks, Kerry Road extension and corridor to Beaudesert Road are operationally suitable and their construction proposals are to allow an acceptable lease to NRC in the long term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">" (emphasis added) 
 

214 On 15 April 1993, Mr O'Rourke sent a memorandum to Mr Hamill reporting that NRC had commenced operations at the AR terminal on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">He stated that documentation to allow "the transfer" was in place and that it consisted of an initial 90 day license for the area edged black on an attached plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">This was apparently a reference to the 1993 lease area as shown at [193] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">215 The memorandum included the following statement:-
 
 "At the end of the 90 day period it is anticipated that Queensland Rail and NRC will enter into formal leases for a three year period for both property and plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">These leases anticipate that NRC may choose to purchase assets or Queensland may become a shareholder in NRC during this period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">" 
 

216 The "suite" of documents that controlled QR's relationship with NRC was described in the memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The contact officer within QR was stated in the memorandum to be Mr Eades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">217 In an internal NRC memorandum from Mr Hanscomb to Mr Tony Usher dated 23 April 1993, Mr Hanscomb set out a check list of matters to be followed up as a result of the execution of the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">218 Mr Hanscomb stated in the memorandum that the 90 day licence period was struck to enable amongst other things, the resolution of issues relating to the shunt neck, the Administration Building and the car park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">As to these issues, Mr Hanscomb said that they:-
 
 "... are as yet unresolved.</sentence>

 May 1993 - November 1993: State of Queensland defers decision to become a Shareholder of NRC 
 
219 On 26 May 1993, Mr O'Rourke signed a submission to the Board of QR seeking approval of a management recommendation that the State of Queensland not become a shareholder of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The recommendation was based upon a cash flow analysis which indicated a potential loss of revenue of approximately $150 million over 20 years if the State of Queensland were to become a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">This was, plainly, a reference to the potential loss of rental income from a 20 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">220 At Mr O'Rourke's request, Mr Price reviewed the quantum of the prospective loss of revenue with a view to a more conservative forecast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The revised figures were provided to Mr O'Rourke and to Mr Hearsch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">221 On 10 August 1993, the Chairman of QR, Mr NH Blunt, wrote to Mr Hamill setting out QR's consideration of the financial impact of the State of Queensland taking shares in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">The letter referred to the benefit of NRC's promised $10 million commitment to the Fisherman Islands project but also to the disadvantages of foregone leasing revenue and prospective calls for funds on shareholders, which "appeared likely given that current annual interstate freight losses were in the order of $320 million".</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">222 The letter included the following assessment:-
 
 "Shareholder status would therefore conservatively impose on Queensland, a financial impost of approximately $27m over the next 3 years (discounted over time) and approximately $95m over the next 20 yrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">" (emphasis added)
 

223 The emphasised portion of Mr Blunt's letter was a reference to QR's more conservative assessment of the financial impact of the loss of revenue from a 20 year lease of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">224 The letter concluded with the statement that in view of the analysis of the financial disadvantage, the Board of QR was of the opinion that "from a Queensland Rail perspective the state should not become an equity partner in the NRC".</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">225 At about the same time, the Board of NRC was also considering the benefits and burdens of securing the State of Queensland as a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">In Mr Graham's Board Paper of 19 August 1993, he referred to the Queensland Government's understanding that NRC would contribute $10 million to Fisherman Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">He also referred to the benefit of being able to obtain a transfer to NRC of the AR terminal and equipment in return for the issue of shares rather than by way of cash payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">The current value of the AR leases was said to be $600,000 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">226 On 27 August 1993, the Board of NRC authorised Mr Butcher and Mr Graham to negotiate a "package" with the State of Queensland providing for a $10 million contribution to Fisherman Islands and Queensland agreeing to become a shareholder of NRC and provide title to the interstate operations component of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">227 On 13 September 1993, Mr Butcher wrote to Mr Hamill referring to an earlier exchange of letters and a meeting in March 1993 about the Fisherman Islands Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The letter stated that the Board of NRC recognised the benefits of having NRC as a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Reference was made to Mr Hamill's letter of 20 January 1993 in which he stated that the Queensland Government's decision to become a shareholder was dependent upon NRC contributing $10 million to the Fisherman Islands Standard Gauge Link Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">228 Mr Butcher continued by stating that the Board of NRC had authorised Mr Graham and Mr Butcher to negotiate with Mr Hamill to develop a package of arrangements that would provide for a $10 million contribution by NRC to Fisherman Islands in return for equity participation by the State of Queensland in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">229 Mr Butcher then said:-
 
 "The package developed would incorporate additional equity consideration for Queensland for the transfer by title or long term lease of the Acacia Ridge interstate terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">As you are aware we have developed a substantial program of investment to upgrade this terminal to complement the large investment being made on rail infrastructure in the Sydney-Brisbane corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">" (emphasis added) 
 

230 On 12 October 1993, Mr Hamill wrote to Mr Butcher with reference to a meeting which had taken place between them the previous month to discuss issues relating to the question of the State of Queensland taking shares in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Mr Hamill referred to NRC's goodwill and commitment to achieving significant economic reforms in interstate freight operations and resultant benefits for the national economy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">231 Mr Hamill referred in the letter to NRC's commitment to provide $10 million to Fisherman Islands, which was to be made by mid 1994, and to meetings which were to take place between, inter alia, Queensland Department of Transport representatives and NRC representatives, to consider the impact on the State of Queensland of taking equity in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Mr Hamill said he expected to be in a position to advise Mr Butcher of the State of Queensland's position in the next month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">232 On 22 November 1993, Mr Hamill wrote to Mr Butcher advising that the State of Queensland had decided that it would not make a final decision on taking equity in NRC until just prior to February 1996, which was the "deadline" under the EA for taking equity on the terms and conditions which were then current.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">233 Mr Hamill stated in the letter that even though the State of Queensland had decided not to take equity at that stage, he reaffirmed the Queensland Government's support for rail reform and for NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">He said that Mr Butcher could be assured that Queensland, as an "Other State" under the EA would continue to fulfil its obligations and endeavour to assist NRC to achieve its objectives whenever possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Mr Hamill referred again to the link between NRC's $10 million contribution to Fisherman Islands and the decision of the State of Queensland to become a shareholder in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">September 1993 - November 1993: NRC remains in occupation under the 4 April 1993 Heads and commencement of expenditure on AR terminal 
 
234 On 31 August 1993, approximately 2 months after the expiration of the 90 day period contemplated for the execution of the formal lease documents, Mr Jenner, QR's Manager Property Management, wrote to Mr Hanscomb about the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Mr Jenner asked Mr Hanscomb to confirm that NRC's continuing occupation was under the terms of the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Mr Jenner stated that the delay in finalising the lease was not acceptable to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">235 On 10 September 1993, Mr Hanscomb confirmed to Mr Jenner that NRC's occupation of the AR terminal was upon the terms and conditions set out in the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">236 Three days earlier, on 7 September 1993, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham confirming approval for NRC to undertake "the Stage 1 Development Proposal" as embodied in a Concept Design Report issued in May 1993, which was the construction of Track A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The letter stated that approval was given in accordance with the provisions of the 4 April 1993 Heads and the draft agreement for real estate lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">237 Mr O'Rourke followed up on his letter of 7 September 1993 in a further letter to Mr Graham dated 23 September 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Mr O'Rourke raised with Mr Graham his concern that development not proceed until such time as NRC had the protection of a formal lease, which Mr O'Rourke thought to be imminent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">238 Mr Graham replied to Mr O'Rourke on 4 November 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">He said that equity funds had been released to enable the works to commence almost immediately, with construction to begin on 8 November 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">He also said that whilst the lease was not yet signed, there was "agreement in most areas with only the issue of the valuations, now remaining".</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">239 On 6 November 1993, Mr O'Rourke sent a copy of Mr Graham's letter of 4 November 1993 to Mr Eades and requested his advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">30 June 1994: NRC defers request for transfer or lease of AR terminal 
 
240 In a Board Paper dated 30 June 1994, Mr Graham sought Board approval to continue the process of acquiring terminal land and ancillary equipment in Alice Springs, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The Board Paper requested endorsement of the strategy of not seeking the transfer of the AR terminal and ancillary equipment until the Queensland Government decided to take equity in NRC or 6 months before the end of the current lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">241 The strategy of deferring a request for transfer of the AR terminal and equipment was approved by the Board of NRC at a meeting on 8 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">July - November 1994: the emerging significance of the Hilmer Report 
 
242 In a Board Paper dated 27 July 1994, Mr Graham set out the background to the issue of the Report of the Independent Committee of Enquiry into Australia's National Competition Policy ("the Hilmer Report") and its implications for NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Mr Graham said that the Hilmer Report had been handed down in August 1993 and that it would be considered by the Council of Australian Governments ("COAG") on 19 August 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Mr Graham stated that the principles for future competition policy recommended in the Hilmer Report included opening up third party access to facilities that are essential for effective competition, eg third party access to rail networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">243 The Board Paper commented that, for NRC, the most important recommendations in the Hilmer Report were those aimed at fostering competition within areas of Government business organisations, in particular, that Governments should open up, inter alia, rail networks to competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Mr Graham stated that opening access to the rail network presented threats and opportunities for NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">He said that the threat of competition had begun to emerge in proposals for new interstate rail services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">244 During late 1994, QR was also giving consideration to the impact of the reforms proposed in the Hilmer Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">In a discussion paper entitled "National Competition Policy, Impact on Australia's Railway Industry", QR commented on the impact of the reforms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">The discussion paper stated that the Hilmer Report would have "a profound impact" on economic reform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">It said that the impact of the National Competition Reform Bill would be felt across the breadth of Australian industry, not least on the railway industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">August 1994 - November 1994: the Proposed Long Term Track Access Agreement 
 
245 In July 1994, NRC and QR entered into a 90 day interim train Crewing Agreement, effective from 26 July 1994, with a view to entering into a long term Track Access Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">246 On 19 August 1994, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke stating that he viewed the proposed Track Access Agreement as the principal agreement covering the long term relationship of NRC and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">He attached a draft 30 year Track Access Agreement for discussion purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">247 The draft Track Access Agreement provided for access rights for train movements of NRC trains as specified in a schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Provision was made for additional access rights if the demand for NRC's services increased such that, in NRC's reasonable opinion, it required the scheduling of additional NRC train movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">248 On 14 September 1994, Mr Hearsch wrote a memorandum to Mr O'Rourke entitled "NRC Long Term Track Access Agreement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Mr Hearsch recommended that in light of the Hilmer Report and the emerging interest of potential third party operators for standard gauge access and QR's own commercial interests in at least part of the rail corridor, an access agreement should be negotiated with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">Mr Hearsch recommended that such an agreement should have an initial life of three years with an option for five year extensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">249 Mr Hearsch commented also on the advantages and disadvantages of the grant of a long term lease over the AR terminal to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">He said that any third party operators would need to negotiate with NRC for access and that NRC may seek to discourage interested parties through pricing policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">250 In a Board Paper dated 26 October 1994, Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb reported to the Board of NRC on the status of their negotiations with QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The Board Paper stated that on 11 October 1994, Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb met with QR's Managing Director and senior executives, namely Mr O'Rourke, Mr Hearsch, and Mr Ken Haase, to discuss a range of issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">251 The Board Paper records that QR stated:-
 
 "its clear intention to remain the owner of the track and infrastructure and as such is only prepared to grant National Rail access rights rather than a long term lease or ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">" 
 

252 The Board Paper also records that QR expressed a strong preference for a term of only three years for a track access agreement in order to preserve QR's flexibility with regard to a number of factors; these included potential third party users and other implications following from the adoption of the recommendations made in the Hilmer Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">253 NRC's response, as recorded in the Board Paper, was to explain its need for a long term commitment in the order of 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">NRC said it required security of tenure to:-
 
 " - amortise existing investments such as the $10.3 million upgrade of Acacia Ridge and potential investments such as the proposed $1.5 million sound barrier at the terminal; 
 - support Customer Service Agreements of medium to long term duration; and 
 - support business planning and investment decisions in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">" 
 

254 The reference to the $10.3 million upgrade of the AR terminal was to the cost of construction of the track known as Track A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The effect of the evidence was that all of the expenditure occurred between August 1993 and the end of 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">255 The minutes of the NRC Board meeting on 4 November 1994 record that it had tabled and noted the Board Paper of 26 October 1994 which set out the current status of negotiations with QR in respect of track access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">256 On 24 November 1994, Mr Hanscomb wrote to Mr O'Rourke seeking his formal commitment to a Services Agreement Stage 2 as outlined at a Railways of Australia Commissioner's meeting held during the previous week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Mr Hanscomb stated that the elements of NRC's proposal were that NRC and QR would identify the limited functions currently performed by QR that would continue to be performed post 1 July 1995 and that commercial terms would be negotiated for those services, including track access and infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">257 Mr Hanscomb stated in the letter that the initial term for the Track Access Agreement should be only one year duration in order to:-
 
 &#8226; enable NRC's shareholder governments to consider their response to NRC's decision on nomination of track and infrastructure
 &#8226; enable shareholders to consider their response to access issues in light of legislative or policy changes flowing from the Hilmer Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">

258 The Track Access Agreement was apparently signed on 28 June 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">May 1995 --- September 1995: Disputes over charges for track access and request for long term agreement 
 
259 By letter dated 9 May 1995, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke declining to approve payment of a number of invoices totalling almost $17 million for Stage 2 services, including track access charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Mr Graham said that the charges did not reflect payment under any agreed contract or arrangement for the period in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">He complained that the charges were not commercial from NRC's point of view because they were substantially in excess of NRC's revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">260 Mr Graham's letter continued as follows:-
 
 "National Rail is currently involved in a major locomotive acquisition program requiring commercial debt to support the locomotive contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">On the basis of the provisional invoices you tabled National Rail has serious concerns with the level of track access charges as well as the security of long term access to Queensland Rail's standard gauge network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">" 
 

261 He suggested that a meeting take place and said:-
 
 "I believe we should also take the opportunity at that meeting to discuss in principle a longer term replacement for the short term lease National Rail has over the Acacia Ridge intermodal terminal and the term of ten years plus ten National Rail has sought for the steel handling area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">" 
 

262 Mr O'Rourke replied on 2 June 1995, stating that QR was seeking full cost recovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">He said that he and Mr Graham had "different interpretations of what we would both understand to be a commercial arrangement between us".</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">He continued:-
 
 "Queensland Rail has been a strong supporter of National Rail from its inception ... As a non shareholder we see ourselves in a different position to the shareholding states, and we would like to resolve the issue of Stage II outstandings and to develop a commercial track access arrangement to apply from 1 July 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">" 
 

263 The foreshadowed meeting took place later in June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">In a memorandum dated 20 June 1995, Mr Hanscomb recorded that the meeting was attended by Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb for NRC and Mr O'Rourke and Mr Ian Dobbs for QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">Mr Hanscomb said that they "continued to agree to disagree" about the charges for Stage 2 services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">264 Mr Hanscomb's memorandum continued as follows:-
 
 " Long Term Lease of Acacia Ridge
 
 The current lease will expire on 4 April 1996 and NR is to advise its intentions by 1 February 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">We told Vince O that we will be looking for a long term lease (20 years plus) where we are effectively masters of our own domain ie we will want to be fully responsible for every thing in our boundaries, maintenance etc and not have to obtain QR approval for anything we do on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">
 
 QR accepted the principle and said they will be out of most of the admin building shortly and plan to be out of the signals area in the next few years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">
 
 Derek Harris and John McNamara to review the existing lease and recommend which sections we should seek to renegotiate as part of a long term arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">
 
 Acacia Ridge Steel Terminal
 
 QR remains adamant that it will only offer a ten year lease with a ten year option effectively at its discretion ie its QR's option not NR's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">" (emphasis added) 
 
 

265 In a Board Paper dated 19 July 1995 from Mr Graham and NRC's Chief Financial Officer, Mr John Kitney, it was said that Rail Authority leases for terminal facilities were, for the most part, of three to five year duration except for Perth where a 21 year lease of the terminal had been obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">266 The Paper stated that it was an operating budget assumption that shareholder terminal leases would be terminated in October 1995 and "equity issued for the asset transferred".</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">The Board Paper was tabled and considered at a meeting on 28 July 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">267 On 20 September 1995, Mr Affleck, Acting Managing Director, wrote to Mr O'Rourke stating that NRC appreciated an offer made by QR to withdraw its claim for charges for 1993 --- 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">He said that, however, NRC was unable to agree the remaining claim for 1994 - 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">He recognised and shared QR's frustration:- 
 
 "...</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">However, as Vince has previously stated, commercial terms for National Rail means an amount that the Company can reasonably afford, based on the income-earning capacity of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">" 
 

268 Mr Graham gave evidence that he saw the letter on return from leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">269 In September 1995, Mr Hanscomb provided the NRC Executive with a paper on the progress of the transfer of assets and functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">He reported that the business was not capable of sustaining track access prices significantly above the efficient cost of track maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">He also said that negotiations with Queensland, NSW and Victoria were not far progressed but that those states would need to take a realistic approach to track access if east coast rail services were to continue to be viable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">September 1995: NRC Board Meeting to consider impact of Hilmer Report 
 
270 In a Board Paper dated 20 September 1995, Mr Graham stated that the directors of NRC had affirmed their desire to hold a one-day meeting to discuss opportunities and threats resulting from the Hilmer Report and the changing transport market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">271 The Board Paper included the following comments under the heading "Short Run Threats":-
 
 "It is difficult to envisage a private sector competitor being able to enter any of National Rail's existing markets in the short run given the considerable barriers to entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">These barriers include: 
 
 - the absence of any defined uniform access arrangements applying to the interstate rail corridors and hence the need for multiple protracted negotiations in an uncertain environment; - the need to procure suitable terminal facilities, qualified and accreditated [sic] train crew and crew facilities at appropriate locations, a locomotive fleet, a wagon fleet, and maintenance facilities; - long term track access rights and supply agreements with customers to justify the substantial investment that would be required to obtain the above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">
 
 
 Hence in the short run any direct competition is likely to be restricted to the existing rail authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">Competition from the rail authorities, if any is likely to be sporadic and targeted at one off or selected opportunities such as Perth bound services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">This is because National Rail already effectively controls the majority of suitable resources (ie rolling stock, terminals and crew) and the most desirable train paths (ie departure and arrival times).</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">
 
 Nevertheless a number of existing National Rail customers and possibly others are understood to have approached the rail authorities and their government departments over the past 12 months or so seeking prices for various arrangements ranging from access only, through hook and pull services to dedicated trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">" 
 

272 Under the heading "Long Run Threats", the Board Paper commented that it was difficult to envisage a private sector market entrant competing with NRC on a large scale national basis in the longer term because of the substantial barriers to entry outlined above, and because the majority of the business was of marginal profitability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">The major competitive threat was thought to be from road and possibly sea on the east-west corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">273 Reference was also made in the Board Paper to three possible track access scenarios that NRC might face.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">They were:-
 
 &#8226; track retained by existing owners or a state based owner such as Railnet in NSW;
 &#8226; track transferred to a national infrastructure authority; or
 &#8226; control of track and responsibility for maintenance transferred to NRC in accordance with EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">

274 Strategies for dealing with the first and second of these three scenarios were set out in the event that NRC had to face them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The East Coast Strategy 
 
275 In a Board Paper dated 6 December 1995, Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb recommended to the Board of NRC a capital investment strategy to secure the competitiveness and profitability of NRC's east coast services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">The strategy comprised the purchase of additional locomotives and wagons to reduce operating costs as well as the expansion of terminals and the construction of passing loops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">276 Essential to the East Coast Strategy was the need for terminals to accommodate 1,500 metre trains which were seen as improving NRC's efficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">277 The principal features of the East Coast Strategy were:-
 
 &#8226; purchase of 40 additional locomotives at a cost of approx $117 million;
 &#8226; purchase of 190 wagons at a cost of $59 million;
 &#8226; construction of passing loops to accommodate 1,500 metre trains between Melbourne and Brisbane at a cost of approximately $15 million with an additional $5 million to be allowed for works potentially required by State Rail for the passage of long trains through the City Rail network; and
 &#8226; terminal expansion work to accommodate 1,500 metre trains requiring expenditure of $15 million at Melbourne, $56 million at Chullora or Enfield and $4 million at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">

278 The proposed expenditure totalled in excess of $200 million and was described in the Board Paper as Scenario A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">279 The Board Paper stated that the construction of additional passing loops and additional terminal capacity would enable rationalisation of existing east coast services from 43 to 24 per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">280 The investment life of the expenditure was set at 15 years being the life of the locomotives which comprised the single largest component in the package.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">281 Of the 40 additional locomotives, 25 were attributable to the operations at the AR terminal upon the assumption that those locomotives would be used in train paths which had their origin or destination at AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">282 The Board Paper included a sensitivity/risk analysis, which included identifying two major risks, not quantifiable, associated with Scenario A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">They were:-
 
 "- inability or unwillingness of State Rail to agree either in the time frame or ever on the running of long trains through the CityRail network; 
 - State Rail's and PTC's preparedness to let National Rail invest in passing loops on their track in the Sydney-Melbourne corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">This risk may be ameliorated if the states agree to establish Track Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The Board should note that Scenario A does not include any tax deductions or access charge reductions associated with loop investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The NPV of Scenario A would increase to the extent that such effects materialise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">" 
 

283 In stating their conclusions, Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb described Scenario A as conservative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">They referred to other major risks including the competitive position of rail over the investment and track access charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">They continued:-
 
 " The analysis predicts that the do nothing base case would return an NPV of minus $142 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">If the Board rejects Scenario A it should also reject the base case as an alternative and abandon train operations in the East Coast as soon as practically possible and immediately review the scope and need for terminal operations and investments at the Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne terminals necessary to support the Steelink and Westlink Service plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">" (emphasis added)
 

284 Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb concluded by recommending the investment in the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Their recommendations were adopted by the Board of NRC at a meeting on 15 December 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">January 1996 --- March 1997: negotiations for a new lease 
 
285 On 9 January 1996, Mrs Jacqueline Fontaine (n&eacute;e Lowes), NRC's Manager, Commercial Agreements, sent a memorandum to Mr Neal Parkinson of Sly &amp; Weigall, NRC's solicitors, attaching a draft letter giving notice of NRC's intention to seek a further lease of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">286 On 10 January 1996, Mrs Fontaine discussed the draft with Mr Parkinson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">She made a handwritten note of what she said and of Mr Parkinson's advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">The note was as follows:-
 
 "Neal ---

 (3) express choice (a) or (b)-

287 Mrs Fontaine gave evidence that the word "no" in brackets after the question numbered (2) was Mr Parkinson's response to Mrs Fontaine's question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">The acronym "SsA" was a reference to the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">288 The draft letter prepared by Mrs Fontaine was engrossed and sent by Mr Graham to Mr O'Rourke on 31 January 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">The letter commenced by stating that NRC had a lease of the AR terminal which "conditionally" expired on 4 April 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">This was a reference to the draft 1993 real estate lease, the formal lease still not having been executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">289 The letter of 31 January 1996 continued as follows:-
 
 "Clause 7.5 of the lease requires National Rail to notify Queensland Rail in writing by 1 February 1996 if it intends to seek a further lease of the property, and I now do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">National Rail's preference is that the lease of the property be for an initial period of twenty (20) years with an option for National Rail to extend that lease term for a further ten (10) years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">
 
 In meeting this requirement for notice under the lease National Rail does not waive its rights under Clause 5(6)(a) of the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">
 
 National Rail will shortly send a draft lease to your Property Division as a basis for the commencement of negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">" 
 

290 On 27 February 1996, Mr Scheuber wrote to Mr O'Rourke stating that NRC had never identified the property required by it to perform its interstate freight operations in accordance with cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">The letter went on to say that there was no "major objection" to granting NRC a 20 year lease of Acacia Ridge with a 10 year option, provided that NRC complied with its obligation under cl 5(6)(a) "and notify QR accordingly".</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">291 The final form of the 1993 real estate lease was signed on 26 February 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">It contained the following provisions
 
 "7.1 This Lease commences on 4 April 1993.</sentence>

 7.5 The Company must notify the Rail Authority in writing by 1 February 1996 of its intention to either:

 12.5 At the expiration of this Lease, the Company will subject to clause 7.3, unless otherwise agreed, demolish or remove any structure constructed by it on the Land in accordance with this clause except if the Company acquires ownership of, or is given a lease, or is granted access to the Property under the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">The Company will take reasonable care to minimise damage upon effecting any such removal and shall make good to the Rail Authority any damage caused to the Land by such removal.</sentence>

 14.2 The Company will, unless otherwise agreed, at the expiration of this Lease or if renewed at the expiration of the further term, remove all such fittings, furniture, plant, equipment, partitions or other articles and assets including Company Fittings except if the Company acquires ownership or is given a lease or is granted access to the Property under the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>

292 During March and April 1996, there were discussions between NRC and QR about expenditure of funds on track upgrading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Reference was made to the inadequacy of the existing lease documentation in allocating responsibility for works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">293 On 26 March 1996, there was a meeting between various NRC and QR personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">This was one of the regular monthly meetings between those parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">The attendees included Mr McNamara of NRC and Mr Haase of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Mr McNamara stated at the meeting that he would prefer to have money spent on track maintenance now, rather than wait for a new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">294 On 24 April 1996, there was a further meeting between the parties about effort to have "the yard" upgraded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">The QR personnel referred, inter alia, to the number of train derailments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">The NRC personnel said:-
 
 &#8226; the general state of the yard was not sufficient to allow present operations without the risk of derailment;
 &#8226; an upgrading program was needed urgently; and
 &#8226; the current leasing arrangements did not clearly define who was responsible to performing the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">

295 On 20 May 1996, Mrs Fontaine wrote to Mr Jenner enclosing a discussion draft of long lease of the AR terminal for review and comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Mrs Fontaine said that the draft was based on the executed 1993 real estate lease with changes marked up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">The draft lease provided for a term of 10 years with an option to review for a further 10 year period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">296 On 14 June 1996, Mr McNamara and other NRC personnel met with a number of QR officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">Mr McNamara reported on the meeting in a memorandum of the same date to Mr Fullerton and others from NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">He reported that QR was proposing to reduce the area of the long lease by excluding the marshalling area, that is Industrial Roads 5 to 9 to the east of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">He said that QR's reasoning was based on NRC requesting a 30 year lease and their concern for third party access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">297 Mr McNamara said in his memorandum that the implications of that proposal were:-
 
 &#8226; NRC has funded capital works to extend tracks one and two to 1,200 metre and they would be outside the proposed lease area;
 &#8226; NRC had agreed with QR to fund the upgrading of tracks one to nine at a cost of $500,000 and this would be outside the lease area; and
 &#8226; space at AR was at a premium and any reduction in tracks would adversely affect NRC's operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">

298 Mr McNamara recommended in his memorandum that in negotiations with QR, NRC retain the current lease area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">He suggested that legal advice on third party access was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">299 On 18 June 1996, Mr Jenner wrote to Mrs Fontaine in response to her letter of 31 January 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Mr Jenner asserted that QR had received no advice or nomination of the property nominated by NRC to be leased to it in accordance with cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">He said that QR considered "the preservation sought by National Rail under cl 5(b)(a) [sic] is not valid".</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">This was presumably a reference to Mrs Fontaine's statement that NRC did not waive its rights under cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">300 In his letter of 18 June 1996, Mr Jenner said that the discussion draft lease forwarded under cover of Mrs Fontaine's letter of 20 May 1996 was not acceptable to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">He said that a number of matters needed to be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">301 Mr Jenner pointed out that QR became a government owned corporation on 1 July 1995 and, in accordance with the TIR Act it had identified the 27 hectare site of the AR terminal as "commercial corridor land" which remained in QR's ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">302 Mr Jenner said in the letter that the AR terminal was surrounded by "rail corridor" land with no dedicated road access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">He said it was proposed that access be by way of an easement over the roadway covered by the 1993 real estate lease which expired on 4 April 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">He said that the Department of Natural Resources would have to agree to the proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">303 Mr Jenner also referred to the Administration Building which he said would be classified as "QR corporate" to be held by QR "in Fee Simple".</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">304 Reference was also made to the noise barrier constructed by NRC which was said to be on land to be identified as "corridor" land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">This would be subleased to QR by Queensland Transport with the head lease held by the Department of Natural Resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Agreement on the terms of those leases had not been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">Mr Jenner said that a "sub sub lease to cover the noise barrier will be the most likely eventuality".</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">305 Mr Jenner said in his letter that QR was addressing a number of operating issues including third party access obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">He continued:-
 
 "The proposed new boundaries of the container terminal include the locomotive provisioning facility and will include 'track No 1' on which NRC propose to store locomotives from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">The area outside of the new boundaries, which formed part of the former agreement, has been identified as an asset which should be made accessible to all current and potential standard gauge operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">This area will be covered by an access agreement between National Rail and Queensland Rail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">
 
 The attached plan is indicative of the proposed terminal lease area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">It is however being amended to include track No 1 and provide the necessary 'Corridor' width to accommodate the duplication of the main line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">As soon as these adjustments are made I will forward a plan for your consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">A draft Lease Document is also being prepared for your consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">
 
 To formalise the full relationship at the Acacia Ridge Interstate Freight Terminal between National Rail and Queensland Rail an access agreement which I understand is being negotiated at present, and a service agreement to cover such issues as provision of signalling, maintenance etc, NRC may require Queensland Rail to perform on behalf of NRC, are required to be negotiated and signed at the same time as the lease agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">" 
 

306 Mr Jenner then addressed the area known as the southern area over which NRC held an option under the 1993 real estate lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">He said that if this option was to carry forward to the new lease, QR would seek an option payment for an agreed number of years or an annual rental payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">He concluded that "[f]rom the foregoing it is obvious that there are a number of significant issues that need to be negotiated" and suggested a meeting of representatives of NRC and QR as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">307 On 5 July 1996, Mr Jenner sent Mrs Fontaine a proposed lease of the BHP Acacia Ridge site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">He said the document would form the basis for negotiation (ie of that area only).</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">308 On 8 July 1996, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke about various issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">He referred to QR's proposal that the marshalling yards be removed from the AR terminal lease area and included as part of a track access agreement so that they would be available to all users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Mr Graham said that NRC was prepared to agree in principle to "this new QR approach".</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">He noted, however, that NRC had spent about $1 million improving the marshalling yards and intended shortly to spend another $500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">309 Mr Graham then said that if NRC was to hand back the marshalling yards, it required:-
 
 "- repayment of its $1 million in expenditure 
 - an undertaking by QR to complete the necessary works to enhance the efficiency of Acacia Ridge, and 
 - an appropriate reduction in the terminal rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">" 
 

310 Mr Graham proposed that, alternatively, NRC could write off the $1 million expenditure and complete the $500,000 upgrade at its expense as part of a package to resolve outstanding issues between the parties about track access charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">311 On 2 August 1996, Mr Duncan McLeod sent an email to Mr John Fullerton with copies to Mr McNamara and other NRC personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">He said that QR had declined to convert the short term lease over the marshalling yards to a long lease, preferring instead to give NRC access rights so as to leave the way open for other operators to use the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">312 Mr McNamara replied on the same day expressing his disappointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">He said that in Brisbane "[w]e continue to operate in a substandard yard and the politics associated with the development of the National Rail lease are going to delay the promised improvements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">313 On 19 August 1996, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham attaching a "without prejudice" proposal for the resolution of outstanding issues relating to track access and track access charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">314 In a Board Paper dated 21 August 1996, Mr Graham recommended that a contingency sum of $300,000 be added to previously approved expenditure of $2.9 million for the construction of locomotive provisioning facility at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">The recommendation was endorsed by Mr Fullerton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">The approval of the expenditure of $2.9 million had been given at a Board meeting on 2 February 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">315 On 23 August 1996, Mr Graham replied to Mr O'Rourke's letter of 19 August 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">He said that the terms for finalising track access arrangements to 30 June 1996 as set out in the attachment were acceptable, subject to three points of clarification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">It is not necessary to set them out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">316 On 2 September 1996, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham effectively agreeing to a resolution of all track access issues including the three points of clarification mentioned in Mr Graham's letter of 23 August 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">The result of this was that NRC and QR agreed to the exclusion of the marshalling yards from the AR terminal lease area in return for a payment of $1.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">317 On 1 October 1996, Mrs Fontaine wrote to Mr Jenner requesting a number of amendments to the terms and conditions of a draft AR terminal lease sent to her by Mr Jenner on 5 July 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">A substantial number of amendments were proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">It is not necessary to set them out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">The letter concluded with the following penultimate paragraph:-
 
 "Please note that the above comments are of a preliminary nature only and the draft has not yet been forwarded to National Rail's legal advisers, who may make further comments in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">" 
 

318 On 24 November 1996, Minister Sharp, the then Commonwealth Minister for Transport, announced the Government's intention to sell its interest in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">319 On 27 November 1996, Mrs Fontaine sent a memorandum to Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">She stated that all issues requiring resolution for the finalisation of the long term lease of the AR terminal had been discussed with QR but not all issued had been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">320 Mrs Fontaine observed in her memorandum that there were a number of matters that would take "somewhere in the region of 6 months to resolve".</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">These included subdivision of the land and rezoning of the leased area, audit for contamination and similar due diligence enquiries, as well as valuation for rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">321 The memorandum concluded as follows:-
 
 "A draft Agreement for Lease was forwarded to QR on 20 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">I have not yet had discussions with QR in relation to the draft Agreement for Lease, however, I do not anticipate that the document will be difficult to negotiate and obtain agreement on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">I think it is realistic to expect that the Agreement for Lease will be agreed before the end of this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">" 
 

322 On 10 December 1996, Ms Diana Calvisi, a solicitor in the Corporate Counsel Division of QR, wrote to Mrs Fontaine enclosing 20 pages of amendments to the draft lease which NRC had submitted to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">It is unnecessary to set out the detailed comments made by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">Ms Calvisi stated that QR reserved its right to make further amendments to the proposed changes when decisions were made on unresolved issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">323 In addition to the draft amendments Ms Calvisi stated that there were a number of matters relating to the proposed lease that required clarification and discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">324 The first matter was NRC's election under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Ms Calvisi stated:-
 
 "As you are aware, the Shareholders' Agreement dated the 30 th of July 1991 gives National Rail certain rights in relation to the Acacia Ridge property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">Queensland Rail has been proceeding in its negotiations with National Rail at this time on the basis that National Rail's proposal to enter into this proposed lease constitutes National Rail's election under the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">
 
 Queensland Rail requires you to confirm in writing that National Rail's intention to enter into this Lease is its intention to lease the property in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">" 
 

325 The second matter was the Administration Building.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">In a letter written in 1994, NRC had agreed to pay $13,000 per annum indexed to the CPI, for 30 years, in addition to the rent payable under the long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">These payments were to increase to approximately $32,000 per annum when QR vacated the building.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">The question which Ms Calvisi raised was, in view of the fact that the proposed lease of the AR terminal was to be for 10 years, how did NRC propose to deal with its commitment to pay rent for the Administration Building for 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Ms Calvisi proposed that the rental payments for the Administration Building be dealt with in a separate deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">326 The third matter was the encroachment of the Administration Building onto the rail corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Ms Calvisi stated that approximately one third of the Administration Building and part of the car park area would encroach onto the rail corridor which was owned by the State of Queensland and that the encroaching part of the Administration Building may, in the future, have to be demolished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">She suggested that NRC take a sub sub lease, with the Department of Transport as head lessee and QR as sub lessee, which would be for nominal rent and contain a demolition clause to apply to the encroaching parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">327 As an alternative to a sub sub lease, Ms Calvisi proposed a licence over the encroaching areas, terminable on short notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">328 The fourth matter was the possible relocation of the rail corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">Ms Calvisi stated that it was proposed at some stage in the future to change the location of the rail corridor, particularly if this was requested by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">329 Ms Calvisi said that if this relocation occurred after the lease was registered, the lease could not be amended because it was not possible to amend a registered lease if there were changes in the leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">She observed that if this happened, it would be necessary to surrender the lease and enter into a new one, and QR would require NRC to pay all the costs of the re-survey and the costs of the surrender of lease, as well as stamp duty on the new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">330 On 20 January 1997, Mr Graham reported to the Board of NRC on the results of a strategic review of operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">The report stated that the strategic review had found that the basis of the EA was being abandoned by the parties to the EA in order to give rapid effect to competition principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">The disadvantages said to flow from this included opportunities for new entrants, potentially high track access charges, and most significantly from NRC's perspective:-
 
 "the prospect of terminals being vested in the track authorities may cost National Rail the ability to pursue essential product differentiation strategies in the intermodal business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">" 
 

331 On 30 January 1997, Mrs Fontaine wrote to Mr Jenner commenting upon the matters raised in Mrs Calvisi's letter of 10 December 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">As to the first matter, that is, "election" under the EA, Mrs Fontaine confirmed that NRC proposed to lease the land on commercial terms in accordance with the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">As to the three other matters, Mrs Fontaine's comments were to the effect that further discussions should take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">332 Mrs Fontaine also set out her responses to Ms Calvisi's 20 page list of proposed amendments to the draft lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">Mrs Fontaine agreed with most of the amendments but some were not agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">One was QR's request for the deletion of an indemnity sought by NRC against claims arising from the condition of the leased premises before the commencement of the long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">333 On 27 February 1997, Mrs Fontaine wrote to Mr Barty of the Queensland Department of Transport setting out a proposal as to how the lease of the AR terminal could accommodate NRC's future plans to identify an alternative location for the rail corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">334 Mr Barty replied to Mrs Fontaine on 13 March 1997 that Queensland Transport was investigating the issues raised in her letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">335 On 20 March 1997, Mr Graham prepared his report for the 66 th Board meeting of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Under the heading "Securing National Rail Assets from Shareholders" he referred to the Commonwealth's "equivocation on asset transfer" which he said was contagious, with Victoria also questioning further locomotive transfers, as well as the transfer of the Dynon terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The Commonwealth's equivocation and its effect on the NSW and Victorian governments had been the subject of a letter dated 14 March 1997 from Mr Peter Young, the Deputy Chair of NRC, to Minister Sharp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">The letter referred to the need to finalise the transfer of assets or long term access to the assets nominated by NRC under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">336 Mr Graham's report of 20 March 1997 also recorded that QR had advised its "reluctance" to enter into a long term lease for the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">This was apparently a reference to a conversation which had taken place at about that time between Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke in which Mr O'Rourke had foreshadowed an event which he would formally notify in writing, namely QR's decision not to grant NRC a long term lease over the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">337 On 26 March 1997, Mrs Fontaine drafted a letter to Mr Jenner attaching a further draft lease following upon discussions at a meeting of 19 February 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">338 Mrs Fontaine gave evidence that the letter was never sent to Mr Jenner, but that the draft letter was an accurate reflection of her position at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">339 The draft letter requested Mr Jenner confirm that the rent adjustment required by reason of the exclusion of the marshalling yards from the lease would be backdated to 1 July 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">340 Mrs Fontaine also stated in her letter that a number of issues were not yet agreed including:-
 
 &#8226; the Administration Building on the rail corridor;
 &#8226; the encroachment of the Administration Building;
 &#8226; identification of an alternative rail corridor;
 &#8226; operational and maintenance agreements including noise barrier maintenance; and
 &#8226; various definitions and other clauses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">

341 Mr Graham's report to the 66 th Board Meeting of NRC was discussed at that meeting which was held on 27 March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">Major issues discussed included the need to secure assets from shareholders "in accordance with their undertakings and obligations" under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">342 On 1 April 1997, after the change of position letter, Mr Barty wrote to Mrs Fontaine about the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">He said that Queensland Transport considered that the new lease was a matter for negotiation between NRC and QR but that there were a number of issues relating to the rail corridor which Queensland Transport wished to have considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">These related mainly to the identification of the new corridor and the alternative access route.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">27 March 1997: the "Change of Position" letter 
 
343 On 27 March 1997, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">The letter commenced by referring to recent discussions between them about NRC's "continued use" of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">This was a reference to a conversation between Mr O'Rourke and Mr Graham on 20 March 1997 in which Mr O'Rourke foreshadowed QR's change of position on the grant of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">344 In the letter of 27 March 1997, Mr O'Rourke said:-
 
 "As previously verbally advised, Queensland Rail has reviewed its position in relation to the long-term future of the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">It has now been decided that a long-term lease will not be given to National Rail in view of the strategic importance of the terminal and the need for it to be operated as a common user facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">Accordingly, Queensland Rail withdraws the offer to enter into a lease for a term of 10 years with two options each of 10 years which has been the subject of incomplete negotiations between the parties in recent months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">" (emphasis added ) 
 

345 Mr O'Rourke continued in his letter by stating that QR was prepared to enter into a further lease of the AR terminal for a period of 12 months on the same terms and conditions as the lease of 26 February 1996 subject to a number of matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">These included:-
 
 &#8226; an agreement by QR to negotiate in good faith an agreement to permit NRC's continued access rights to the terminal (as envisaged in the EA upon the expiration of the lease;
 &#8226; the lease boundaries were to be the same as those in the lease of 26 February 1996 (ie including the marshalling yards);
 &#8226; the rental was to be the same as the lease of 26 February 1996, subject to adjustment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">The amount payable under the side agreement for the Administration Building was to continue to be payable by NRC; and
 &#8226; QR was to maintain the rail infrastructure on the leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">

346 The letter then stated:-
 
 " Queensland Rail considers that the proposal contained in this letter reflects the terms of the Shareholders Agreement dated 30 July 1991 and will ensure that National Rail has the necessary access rights to continue its operations at Acacia Ridge .</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">" (emphasis added)
 

347 Mr O'Rourke concluded by stating that upon receipt of NRC's acceptance of the proposal he would forward the lease document for execution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">348 Mr Graham replied to the letter on 16 April 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">He stated:-
 
 "I acknowledge your letter dated 27 March 1997 withdrawing from previously agreed lease arrangements for the Acacia Ridge Terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">
 
 
 
 
 
 Your reasons for the revised position are difficult to understand given both the strategic status of the Acacia Ridge terminal and its common user status have not changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">
 
 National Rail has invested considerable sums of money upgrading the Acacia Ridge terminal in reliance upon Queensland Rail's representation to National Rail as to a long term lease of Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Acacia Ridge is an essential element of National Rail's integrated national network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">To build its network, National Rail has invested further substantial sums to provide competitive rail services on the east coast of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">
 
 Our agreement on track access and our incomplete agreement to modify our previous written agreement on access to the Fisherman Islands Port have all been on the basis of a long term lease of Acacia Ridge for National Rail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">
 
 I am now seeking legal advice on your letter and will respond when this advice is available.</sentence>

 April 1997: NRC approves capital expenditure after the change of position letter 
 
349 On 10 April 1997 Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton, in conjunction with NRC's Chief Finance Officer, Mr Kitney, signed a Board Paper for the 67 th Board meeting of NRC headed "Financial Arrangements and Management --- Long Loops".</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">350 The purpose of the paper was said to include briefing the Board on new passing loops and extensions required to secure the competitiveness and profitability of NRC's services on the east coast corridor and the western corridor between Melbourne and Adelaide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">The Board Paper recommended approval of the commitment of funds for longer loops on the east coast and western corridors, with a total estimate of $22 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">351 A further Board Paper for the 67 th Board Meeting, dated 16 April 1997 and signed by Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton, recommended approval of the construction of operations tracks at Chullora, forming part of the Sydney freight terminal component of the east coast project, at a cost of $15.9 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">352 Mr Kitney and Mr Graham, signed another Board Paper for the 67 th Board meeting entitled "Finance Report for the Nine Months ending 31 March 1997".</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">The Report included a statement that Directors should note that NRC had spent $17 million in works on leasehold improvements at the AR terminal and $15 million on improvements at the Melbourne terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">It continued:-
 
 "Recent correspondence from QR and the PTC indicate that these rail authorities view the terminals as essential facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">Should the terminals become essential facilities, and National Rail be denied long term exclusive access, the company would be forced to write off some/all of its works investments at these two terminals , rather than accounting for them, as currently, as long term leasehold improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">" (emphasis added)
 

353 The 67 th Board meeting was held on 24 April 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">The finance report referred to in the previous paragraph, was tabled and noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">The minutes record that until issues concerning long term access to various assets were resolved, it would be prudent for NRC not to commit to new projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">Nevertheless, the proposed expenditure of $22 million on new passing loops and the proposed expenditure of $15.9 million on Chullora were "in-principle supported".</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">July 1997 --- April 1998: Further Discussions about a long term lease; QR refuses to reconsider 
 
354 Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke met on 23 July 1997 to discuss the lease and also to discuss Mr O'Rourke's change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">Mr Graham referred to the meeting in his letter to Mr O'Rourke of 4 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">He continued:-
 
 "I understand that Queensland Rail is now agreeable to granting National Rail a long term lease of the terminal for 30 years subject to a right of Queensland Rail to terminate the lease in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">Would you please confirm the circumstances in which termination would be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">" 
 

355 Mr O'Rourke replied on 21 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">He noted that at the meeting of 23 July 1997 he agreed to consider again the issue of granting NRC a long term lease, subject to a right to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">He continued by stating that, however:-
 
 "... after carefully considering the issue further, I must advise that QR's position remains unchanged from that as set out in my letter dated 27 March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">" 
 

356 Mr Graham replied to Mr O'Rourke's letter some two months later, on 16 October 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">He said that QR's position was of significant concern to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">He pointed to the "clear agenda" for micro-economic reform contained in the EA and as part of that agenda, establishment of NRC as an efficient commercial rail company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">357 Mr Graham continued by saying that NRC had made very substantial investments in developing interstate rail transport to and from Queensland including in particular:-
 
 &#8226; investing over $176.5 million in upgrading rail track between Melbourne and Brisbane;
 &#8226; investing over $18 million on the AR terminal; and
 &#8226; increasing the volume of intermodal and shipping freight to and from Brisbane by over 95%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">

358 Mr Graham went on in the letter to say that long term arrangements in relation to terminals were crucial to the objectives for which NRC was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">He said that it was NRC's strong view that a 30 year lease was consistent with QR's obligations under the EA but that he was prepared to accept a short term lease as an interim measure, on the basis that it did not exhaust QR's obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">359 On 21 November 1997, Mr Graham, and NRC's Company Secretary, Mr Roxburgh, prepared a Board Paper for NRC's 74 th Board Meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">The purpose of the Board Paper was to seek agreement on the scope of environmental due diligence associated with terminal acquisition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">Notwithstanding Mr O'Rourke's letter of 21 August 1997, and Mr Graham's reluctant acceptance of a "without prejudice" interim short term lease in his letter of 16 October 1997, the Board Paper stated:-
 
 "(i)t is envisaged that a long term lease for the Brisbane freight terminal will be in place within the next 12 months..." 
 

360 On 21 January 1998, various personnel of QR's Freight Group, including Mr Hearsch and Mr Case, held a meeting to discuss future strategies in regard to QR's requirements at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">The minutes of the meeting noted Mr O'Rourke's letter of 27 March 1997, the meeting between Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke of 23 July 1997, and the letters of 21 August 1997 and 16 October 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">QR's preferred option was said to be:-
 
 &#8226; QR to resume management control of the AR terminal;
 &#8226; QR to ascertain ownership of assets (ie improvements made by QR and NRC respectively)
 &#8226; negotiation for compensation; and
 &#8226; enter into agreement regarding future access rights for NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">

361 The minutes of the meeting listed a number of advantages of QR managing the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">They included QR being perceived as "an honest broker" of the standard gauge terminal by third parties, even if, as was then contemplated, QR were to purchase NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">The advantages were also said to include "synergies" gained through the operation of narrow and standard gauge terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">362 Draft minutes of a meeting of the same personnel on 21 January 1998, which appear to be a draft of the minutes of the meeting referred to above, include the following statement under the heading "Acacia Ridge":-
 
 "Potential change of ownership of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">If lease goes with sale, QR could find itself at the hands of a hostile competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">" 
 

363 In a discussion paper setting out the results of discussions held on 18 January 1998 and 19 January 1998 between officers of QR's Freight Planning &amp; Research Division and a consultant retained by QR, reference was made to QR's objectives at the AR terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">These objectives included ensuring QR was in a position to develop an effective standard gauge business, having control of both narrow gauge and standard gauge at AR, and maximising the potential for North Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">QR's objectives were also said to include having the AR terminal available as a common user facility, ensuring it is used to the maximum and encouraging others to use it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">364 On 25 March 1998, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham referring to NRC's lease of the AR terminal which was said to expire on 31 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">Mr O'Rourke said:-
 
 " I wish to advise that Queensland Rail intends to take over the operation and management of the Terminal in the near future and as such is not prepared to enter into a further lease of the terminal and land for any specified period .</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">
 
 However, NRC may continue in possession of the terminal after the 31 st March 1998 as a tenant from month to month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">This tenancy will be on the same terms and conditions as the previous lease that commenced on the 4 th April 1993 so far as they are applicable to a monthly tenancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">In particular the rent payable in respect of the monthly tenancy will be the same as presently payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">The boundaries of the land, the subject of this tenancy will be the same as those contained in the original lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">
 
 The monthly tenancy may be determined by either party in the manner prescribed by Division 4 of Part VIII of the Property Law Act 1974 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">
 
 As stated previously, it is Queensland Rail's intention to resume the management and control of the Acacia Ridge Terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">This action is in accordance with the provisions of the Shareholder's Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">In particular I would refer you to Clause 5(2) which in so far as 'other States' and therefore Queensland is concerned, specifically excludes any obligation on Queensland's part to cause its rail authority to assist NRC in undertaking functions of the type listed in Schedule 2 and the management of the associated assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">
 
 Accordingly, whilst QR will negotiate in good faith long term access arrangements to the terminal for NRC, such access will not include the management and operation of the Terminal nor will it include any lease or any form of tenure giving NRC exclusive possession of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">
 
 It is my belief that the objectives of the Shareholder's Agreement do not necessarily mean that NRC must have a lease of the Terminal area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">Giving NRC access is an appropriate way of achieving the objectives of the Agreement within the parameters of Queensland's obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">
 
 In the circumstances of our resuming management of the Terminal there will be a need to identify the assets owned by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">Would you please provide details of same as soon as possible so that appropriate arrangements can be made in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">" (emphasis added)
 

365 On 27 March 1998, Mr O'Rourke wrote a separate letter to Mr Graham about access rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">He referred to discussions which had taken place about access to QR infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">He said that interim arrangements were made with a view to developing long term access arrangements to replace the interim measures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Mr O'Rourke stated that:-
 
 "... a long term access agreement will require substantial agreement between the organisations on all terms and conditions of access, which include many measures yet to be discussed in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">" 
 

366 Mr O'Rourke went on to say that he was agreeable to working toward an access agreement which matched the arrangements in place with RAC for Sydney to the border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">He said that this was subject to the approval of Queensland Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">367 On the same day, 27 March 1998, NRC held its 77 th Board meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">The minutes record that Mr Graham advised that he had received a letter from QR advising that QR considered NRC's lease of the AR terminal was to expire on 31 March 1998 and that it would be renewed only on a monthly basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">The minutes record that a meeting with QR was planned in the near future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">368 On 31 March 1998, Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch signed an Information Paper for the Board of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">The Information Paper included the following statement about the background to the current position with respect to the AR terminal lease:-
 
 " As there were poor prospects of achieving early agreement with NRC regarding long term lease conditions for the Acacia Ridge terminal, QR reviewed its strategic position on the matter during late 1996 and early 1997 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">This took into account the NRC privatisation announcement, the expected emergence of third party operators on the East Coast standard gauge rail network and the increasing likelihood that QR's business and operations would extend into the interstate sphere given the on-going major structural changes and reforms occurring throughout the Australian rail industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">This development was foreshadowed in QR's 1997 Corporate Plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">" (emphasis added)
 

369 The Information Paper then referred, under the heading "Background", to the change of position letter of 27 March 1997 and the discussions and correspondence culminating in the letter of 16 October 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">370 The Information Paper went on to describe a meeting between Mr Graham, Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch which had taken place the previous day, 30 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">NRC's response to QR's letter of 25 March 1998, as indicated by Mr Graham at the meeting, was said to be:-
 
 &#8226; NRC believed it had the right to exclusively occupy and manage the AR terminal, rather than merely access, and this was implicitly provided in the EA;
 &#8226; NRC would not voluntarily relinquish control of the AR terminal which was seen to be integral to NRC's management process and business interests; and
 &#8226; interpretation of the EA was a matter for the Queensland Government, not QR, and NRC intended to seek assurances from the Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">

371 Under the heading "Proposed Action", the Information Paper stated, inter alia, that QR received many enquiries from prospective third party operators and, although the AR terminal had "substantial unused capacity", those operators could not gain access because they would be in competition with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">The Information Paper observed that it was QR's intention to operate the AR terminal "as a genuine common user facility ..." and went on to say:-
 
 "The Acacia Ridge interstate container terminal is an exceedingly strategic and valuable asset which is currently owned and potentially controlled by the Queensland Government, through QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">Acceptance of NRC's position and the subsequent NRC privatisation would almost certainly result in effective control of the terminal passing into interstate or foreign hands .</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">Reversion of control of the terminal to QR would substantially add to the realisable value of QR's own assets should a future Government decide to pursue such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">" (emphasis added)
 

372 On 15 April 1998, Mr Graham wrote to Mr O'Rourke referring to the letter of 25 March 1998 and to their meeting of 30 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Mr Graham stated that, as he had commented at the meeting, NRC took the threat by QR to take back possession of the AR terminal as most serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">He said that if NRC lost possession it would seriously threaten NRC's operations to and from Queensland and would adversely affect NRC's overall network operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">He referred to what he had said in his letter of 16 October 1997 that long term arrangements over terminals was crucial to NRC in achieving its objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">373 Mr Graham stated in the letter that he rejected QR's reliance on cl 5(2) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">He said that QR had transferred the function of running the AR terminal to NRC in 1993 and it was not open to NRC to take it back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">The letter continued:-
 
 "Furthermore, since taking over responsibility for the Acacia Ridge terminal, National Rail has expended over $18 million in developing the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">This was not a short term investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">It was undertaken by us in good faith on the basis of agreement with Queensland Rail that National Rail's rights under the Shareholders' Agreement were to be recognised in a long term lease of the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">In addition National Rail has invested in 40 new locomotives, new wagons and extended crossing loops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">" (emphasis added)
 

374 Mr Graham also made reference to the extent to which the AR terminal had been integrated into NRC's operations on the Brisbane/Melbourne corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">He said that handing over the terminals would cause major disruptions, that NRC could not afford uncertainty about its rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">375 Mr Graham concluded his letter with the following prophetic remark:-
 
 "I urge you to re-consider your position before this matter descends into lengthy and expensive litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">" 
 
 
 
 

376 Mr Graham reported the current situation to the Board of NRC in his Managing Director's Report of 16 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">He said that because of QR's strategic concerns over the future ownership of NRC and QR's own ambitions to become a national operator, QR had advised its intention to take over the operations of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">He attached Mr O'Rourke's letter of 25 March 1998 and NRC's "considered legal response" of 15 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">377 The Board of NRC noted Mr Graham's report of 16 April 1998 and the recent correspondence at its meeting of 24 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">August 1997 - January 1999: NRC continues expenditure on East Coast Strategy 
 
378 In a Board Paper dated 18 August 1997, Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton sought Board approval to finalise "generic funding agreements" with Rail Access Corporation ("RAC") and other companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">RAC is a corporation established by the NSW Government to separate ownership of rail infrastructure from the operation of the rail network and providing for the sale or access to the infrastructure through access agreement individually negotiated with RAC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">379 The Board Paper stated that benefits from the $200 million committed thus far to the East Coast Strategy, by way of investment in terminal extensions, additional locomotives and new wagons, would not be fully realised until train lengths were increased to 1,500 metres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">They said that at present train lengths were typically 900 metres but that the Newcastle --- Brisbane steel train had recently been extended to 1,200 metres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">They also said that approval had been received for the trial operation of a 1,200 metre train on the Melbourne-Brisbane service on a daily basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">380 The Board Paper stated that the implementation of the strategy for longer trains required agreements with track owners for loops and operational issues as well as funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">One of the obstacles to this was said to be that NRC's Board had deferred approval of the overall investment while there was still uncertainty over the guaranteed availability of train paths for 150 trains, particularly through Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">The Paper recommended that specific projects be referred progressively to the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">381 A proposed revised strategy for the implementation of long train operations on the east coast and western corridors was noted by the Board of NRC at its meeting of 29 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">The Board resolved that prior to any commitment to long loops with track access providers, a tax ruling be obtained on proposed funding arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">382 In a Board Paper dated 23 October 1997, Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton sought approval in principle for a revised method of funding infrastructure works in NSW for longer trains as part of the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">The Paper sought in principle approval for arrangements whereby the works would be funded and constructed by the RAC and recovered from NRC by special access charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">This was approved by the Board on 31 October 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">383 At a meeting on 30 January 1998, the NRC Board approved loop extensions at a cost of $1.3 million for Gerogery and $1.9 million for Yerong Creek, subject to a risk assessment of NRC's tax exposure for direct funding of these projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">384 On 27 February 1998, the Board of NRC approved the principle of funding track improvements under which NRC granted a loan to the track owner, and enters into a supplementary Track Access Agreement providing for an additional charge for the use of improved track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">385 In a Board Paper dated 15 April 1998, Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton asked the Board to note a number of matters relating to implementation of the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">These matters were, inter alia, that the revised operating strategy involved the addition of a third long train service between Melbourne --- Sydney --- Brisbane each way daily and required an investment in extended crossing loops of $4.5 million additional to the $22 million originally proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">386 In a Board Paper dated 18 June 1998 and entitled "1998 --- 99 Recurrent &amp; Capital Expenditure Budgets", Mr Graham and Mr Kitney reported that, to date, NRC had only one long term track access agreement in place, which was with West Rail in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">The paper stated that other agreements were subject to negotiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">387 In a Board Paper dated 19 October 1998, Mr Graham and Mr Fullerton recommended that the NRC Board note the benefits of completing the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">They referred to the Board's approval of the East Coast Strategy at a cost of over $200 million on 15 December 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">The Board Paper stated that infrastructure works necessary to implement the strategy, and which were yet to be approved, amounted to $31.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">These works comprised:-
 
 &#8226; Sydney Freight Terminal operational sidings costing $20.1 million;
 &#8226; crossing loop extensions on the Melbourne --- Sydney corridor costing $2.7 million; and
 &#8226; crossing loop extensions on the Sydney --- Brisbane corridor costing $8.7 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">

388 On 30 October 1998, the Board of NRC resolved that the proposals for the East Coast strategy and Chullora operational sidings be reconsidered at its December 1998 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">389 On 10 December 1998, Mr Graham, Mr Fullerton and Mr Roxburgh recommended that the Board of NRC approve construction of operational sidings at Chullora, forming part of the Sydney Freight Terminal redevelopment component of the East Coast Strategy, at a cost of $14 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">Board approval was given on 29 January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">November 1998: Freightcorp requests access 
 
390 On 16 November 1998, Mr Pederson, of Freightcorp, wrote to Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">He referred to a conversation between Mr Graham and Mr Di Bartolomeo, the Managing Director of Freightcorp, and requested that Mr Graham confirm NRC's "in principle" agreement to allow Freightcorp trains to pass through the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">391 On 19 November 1998, Mr McNamara sent an email to Mr Graham, with copies to various NRC personnel, reporting on a meeting held the previous day between Mr McNamara and two officers of Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">At the meeting, the Freighcorp officers provided details of a service which they proposed for arrival and departure from the AR terminal five times a week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">Mr McNamara stated in the email that there would have to be follow up discussions with Freightcorp, QR and Network Access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">392 Mr McNamara also reported on a conversation between himself and Mr Martin Oldfield of QR about Freightcorp's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">The email stated that in the course of this conversation, Mr Oldfield had indicated QR had not agreed to provide drivers/shunters for Freightcorp's "operation" and that he was not going "out of his way to make this operation easy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">The email also stated that during the conversation, Mr Oldfield indicated his intention to seek legal advice to determine whether NRC had the right to agree to third party access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">393 Mr Graham responded on 23 November 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">He asked for advice as to whether NRC's lease from QR required QR's approval for third party access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">He said that if there was uncertainty, a letter should be sent to Freightcorp advising them accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">Mr Graham also requested Mr Roxburgh develop cost/commercial terms for access by Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">394 In a letter to Mr O'Rourke dated 25 November 1998, Mr Graham requested QR's consent to NRC granting Freightcorp access to the leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">395 On 18 December 1998, Mr McNamara sent an email to Mr Rick Beckman of NRC regarding Freightcorp, stating that his latest information was that "QR is in no hurry to finalise this matter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">He said that QR was awaiting a memorandum of understanding "to be raised by Freightcorp and to be signed off by QR and Freightcorp".</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">He said that without this, the QR managers with whom he was dealing had been instructed not to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">396 On 19 January 1999, QR consented to NRC granting Freightcorp access to the AR terminal, but on the condition that NRC would not confer any rights to Freightcorp which were more extensive than the rights NRC enjoyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">397 Mr Graham wrote to Freightcorp on 5 February 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">He stated that NRC did not wish to pursue further negotiations until issues concerning NRC's own security of tenure at the AR terminal were resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">398 On 7 June 1999, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Graham to propose that a compromise arrangement which enabled Freightcorp access to the EA Rocke siding, which would have minimal impact on NRC's operations at AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">He proposed that the current boundaries of the lease be amended to exclude the shunt neck, which would enable Freightcorp to access the EA Rocke siding without entering the lease area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">399 Mr Graham's response of 15 June 1999 recorded the steps being taken to facilitate an agreement with Freightcorp for access, but noted NRC's concerns about Freightcorp's shunting plan, which in his view, would disadvantage NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">He emphasised that from his perspective, the next step was for agreement for a long term lease before any arrangement with Freightcorp could be finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">400 Finally, an email from Mr McNamara to Mr Graham dated 20 October 1999 reported that at a meeting held that same day, QR and NRC had agreed that Freightcorp's proposed operating plan was unrealistic, and neither QR nor NRC could cooperate with Freightcorp shunting and preparing their trains during the periods they proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">The Third Amending Agreement 
 
401 On 22 March 1999, the Commonwealth and the States of NSW, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia entered into an agreement to amend the EA ("Third Amending Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">The purpose of the Third Amending Agreement, as stated in Recital B, was to facilitate the sale by the Commonwealth and the States of NSW and Victoria, of their shares in NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">402 The Third Amending Agreement provided that the EA was amended as set out in a schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">Each of the Commonwealth and the States, including the State of Queensland, agreed to procure that a copy of the Third Amending Agreement be tabled in its Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">403 The schedule to the Third Amending Agreement introduced a definition of "Sale Date" which was defined to mean the date on which the Commonwealth, the State of NSW and the State of Victoria completed the sale of the whole of the issued capital of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">404 Three new clauses were added to the EA, immediately following cl 5(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">They were set out in cl 3 of Schedule 1 to the Third Amending Agreement as follows:-
 
 "5(7) (a) Nothing in this agreement entitles the Company to a transfer of ownership or a lease of or access to any assets which the Company has nominated in a Corporate Plan, which have not been transferred or leased to the Company and which comprise "Interstate rail network' or 'Interstate track and related assets' (as each such expression is defined in the ARTC Agreement) nor obliges the Commonwealth, the States or the Other States to transfer ownership of or grant a lease of or access to any such assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">
 (b) Subclause (a) applies notwithstanding that any such asset has been, or is included in a class of assets which has been, whether before or after the date on which the Third Amending Agreement takes effect, identified in a Corporate Plan as being required by the Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">
 
 5(8) The Commonwealth, the States, the Other States and the Company may by an agreement or agreements in writing between all of them (which may be amended from time to time) conclusively determine: 
 (a) the functions to be transferred to the Company under clause 5(4); 
 (b) the assets to be transferred or leased, or in respect of which access is to be given, to the Company under clauses 5(5) and 5(6) and the terms and conditions of any such transfer, lease or grant of access; 
 (c) the payments to be made by the Commonwealth and the States under clause 5(4)(b); 
 (d) the valuation of assets under clause 6(3);

405 Clause 5 of Schedule 1 of the Third Amending Agreement introduced a new cl 14 to the EA in the following terms:-
 
 "On the Sale Date, unless otherwise provided in any agreement in writing between them:

 August 1999: The George Deutsch Report 
 
406 In 1999, NRC and QR jointly retained George Deutsch Consulting Pty Limited ("George Deutsch") to prepare a master plan for intermodal traffic at both the AR terminal and the Q-Link terminal over the next 25 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">The master plan was based upon business forecasts provided by NRC and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">NRC's current throughput was stated to be 210,000 TEU per annum, with growth to 300,000 TEU forecast over the next 10 years and further growth thereafter of 3% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">The term "TEU" is an acronym for "twenty foot equivalent unit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">This is the unit of measure used in the rail industry for measuring container sizes (ie all container sizes are broken down to a TEU).</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">407 QR's throughput was stated to be 110,000 TEU for Queensland Railway Express ("QRX"), which is Toll's North Queensland rail forwarding operation, and 60,000 TEU for other business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">Growth of 2.5% per annum was forecast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">408 The George Deutsch report was produced on 31 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">It recommended separate terminals for NRC and QR, with NRC retaining possession of AR and the construction of a new terminal on the site of the existing Q-Link terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">409 In George Deutsch's opinion, the AR terminal would be able to cater for NRC's traffic for the next 10 to 15 years with little or no change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">410 The new Q-Link terminal was said to be able to accommodate QR's traffic for the next 25 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">411 It would be wrong to suggest that the expanded Q-Link terminal recommended by George Deutsch was to be limited to narrow gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">Reference was made to QR's requirement that the terminal be dual gauged so that it could, if necessary, carry out or support interstate standard gauge activities in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">7 September 1999: Queensland Transport favours common user facility 
 
412 On 7 September 1999, Mr Bruce Wilson, the Director General of Queensland Transport wrote to Mr O'Rourke about a number of issues relating to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">The issues included access to the EA Rocke's siding at the AR terminal by Freightcorp and the lease over the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">413 Mr Wilson said that the matter required urgent attention, given the limited terminals with standard gauge access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">He said that certain parts of the AR terminal and related facilities, in particular the standard and narrow gauge marshalling tracks and related tracks providing connection to the main line should be deemed to be of strategic importance to the State of Queensland in the context of s 215 of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 (Qld) (" Transport Infrastructure Act ") .</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">414 Mr Wilson's letter went on to say that responsibility for the management of those facilities should be transferred from QR's Rail Business Group to its Network Access Group ("NAG") which could "without bias, negotiate access with all relevant parties".</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">415 Mr Wilson also said that Queensland Transport's desired outcome was that the AR terminal be a common user facility and that QR not progress any arrangement which might result in exclusive access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">I will set out the whole of the relevant paragraph, as follows:-
 
 "Whilst cognisant of Queensland Rail's desires to reach agreement with National Rail in regard to a joint venture facility at Acacia Ridge, it is Queensland Transport's desired outcome that the interstate container terminal at Acacia Ridge be a common user facility under an appropriate management regime, consistent with your advice in our previous discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">It is requested that Queensland Rail not progress any arrangement for the granting of a long term lease to NR, or any other actions that might result in NR or any other party (including Queensland Rail) having exclusive access to a facility which must be considered of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Strategic importance to the State.</sentence>

 March 2000: QR concern about hostile purchase of NRC 
 
416 On 20 March 2000, Mr O'Rourke sent a memorandum to Mr Wilson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">The memorandum commenced by stating that NRC's lease at AR expired in 1996 and that it had been on a month to month lease since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Mr O'Rourke said that a "stand-off" had existed since QR's announcement in 1998 that it intended to take back management control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">417 Mr O'Rourke went on to say that NRC had approached QR with a view to establishing a long-term arrangement at AR in the context of the impending sale of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">He said that NRC had the "clear objective" of securing indefinite access for sufficient capacity to ensure its long-term viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">He also said that growth on the Melbourne --- Sydney --- Brisbane corridor was critical to NRC's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">418 Mr O'Rourke continued by saying that QR had made it clear that, as owner of the terminal, it was seeking future options at AR and indeed at key Melbourne and Sydney terminals to facilitate its own national strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">He said that NRC was reluctant to hand over operational control but was willing to contemplate a joint venture with QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">419 The memorandum concluded with the following:-
 
 " QR expressed its concern at a potential hostile purchase of National Rail (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">a Freightcorp/Toll joint venture).</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">QR advised that it would, in principle, be prepared to consider a commercial joint venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">In particular, QR would seek reciprocal access to Southern Terminals , in addition to securing rights to ongoing capacity at Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">
 
 Accordingly, QR will progress consideration of a joint venture with National Rail in respect of Acacia Ridge (Standard Gauge Terminal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">Such a joint venture would clearly be on a commercial basis and consistent with the Queensland Competition Authority Act and associated regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">" (emphasis added)
 
 31 March 2000: QR considers George Deutsch Report 
 
420 On 31 March 2000, Mr Merrigan, who was then a consultant to QR, produced a review of the George Deutsch Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">He considered that the George Deutsch Report lacked "strategic direction" for QR and that it greatly favoured NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">421 Mr Merrigan identified a number of concerns held by QR about the two terminal solution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">The concerns included competition from a third party operator at AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">422 Other considerations identified by Mr Merrigan were that "NRC will not be a player in the long term", that "NRC will not be a terminal operator 10 years out" and that "NRC will not exist 10 years from now".</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">423 Later in his written review, Mr Merrigan stated, inter alia, that "[i]f NRC no longer exists, it could strategically place QR in a stronger competitive position".</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">August 2000: QR officers' strategise about NRC's proposed lease 
 
424 On 14 August 2000, Mr Daniel Owen, Assistant Secretary, Rail Industry, in the Commonwealth Department of Transport wrote to Ms Helen Stehbens, the Acting Executive Director of the Queensland Department of Transport Land Transport Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">Mr Owens referred in the letter to Ms Stehbens' invitation to NRC shareholders to set out the areas sought by NRC under a long term lease over the AR terminal, together with the proposed terms of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">It is apparent that this correspondence was entered into as part of the proposed privatisation of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">425 The tracks nominated in Mr Owens' letter were Track A, NC1 --- NC6, Industrial Roads 1 --- 2 and the "hard stand" areas, the in-gate weighbridges and the provisioning sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">The proposed term was 23 years, being the 30 year term proposed in 1993, less the period of occupation to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">426 On 18 August 2000, Mr David George sent an email to Mr O'Rourke and two other QR officers, including Mr Stephen Cantwell, about a forthcoming QR meeting at which it was apparently planned to discuss the Commonwealth Department of Transport's proposal for a long lease of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">427 The evidence does not make it plain precisely what position Mr George held in August 2000, as he held various positions during his time at QR, but there was evidence that by October 2000, he was QR's Executive Manager, National Development, and reported directly to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">Prior to this he held the position of Group General Manager, Coal and Mainline Freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">428 Mr George's email of 18 August 2000 attached comments from Mr Neil Buckley who was employed in QR's National Development Unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">Mr Buckley was either the Manager, Business Development or the General Manager, National Development Unit, having changed positions at some time during the period from January 1998 to May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">429 Mr Buckley's email of 18 August 2000 was as follows:-
 
 "With respect to the proposal from the Federal Department of Transport, I offer the following comments: 
 
 - The proposal fails to recognise QR's rights as the lawful owner of the facility and our legitimate commercial interests .</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">Parties need to acknowledge this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">
 - We need to determine what jurisdiction Queensland Department of Transport has in this matter and attempt to get the Federal DOT negotiating with QR to avoid some political deal being done at our expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">Note that the QCA Regulation excludes standard gauge infrastructure from the definition of declared services under the QCA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">
 - The money (much of it One Nation funds) that National Rail spent on Acacia Ridge is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">If they spent money on improvements without tenure that is really their commercial problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">
 
 
 With respect to any negotiated outcome the following issues need to be considered: 
 
 - QR (or at the very least a JV) to be the manager of the terminal not NR. 
 - QR's rights to access the terminal (including provisioning facilities) to be enshrined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">
 - One road through the industrial yard to be designated as common user.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">Access to the others will be by negoatiation [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">
 - QR to have reciprocal rights to access southern terminals .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">
 - Federal Government should commit the funds to provide the southern connection to Acacia Ridge Yard if they wish to resolve many of the common user access issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">
 - Existing month to month lease arrangements do not reflect the current value of Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">New prices to be negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">10 year maximum term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">
 - New commercial arrangements with respect to maintenance of the facility would also have to be negotiated with ISG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">" (emphasis added)
 

430 Later on 18 August 2000, Mr Cantwell sent an email to Mr George, Mr Buckley and another QR officer, Mr Peter Ellerby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">Mr Cantwell said he agreed with Mr Buckley's sentiments but that "we need to think carefully about our response ..." He said that appearing to be "bloody minded" would strengthen Queensland Transport's resolve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">He went on to say:-
 
 "The trick will be to develop a response which either blows their proposal away completely due to its illegality or has the appearance of meeting their requirements but preserves QR autonomy, flexibility etc." (emphasis added)
 
 September 2000: Meeting between Mr Graham and Mr Scheuber; NRC's proposal for long term access 
 
431 On 7 September 2000, Mr Graham met with Mr Scheuber, who was then QR's Acting CEO, to discuss NRC's proposal for the future operation and control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">Mr Graham referred to this in his letter to Mr Scheuber of 8 September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">He said that QR had a stated preference for managing and operating the AR terminal while providing services to NRC under commercial terms and conditions to be agreed between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Mr Graham said that NRC, on the other hand, was committed to continue loading and unloading its own trains and providing "interface services" directly to its own customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">432 Mr Graham went on to say in his letter that, recognising both parties concerns and "probable areas of agreement", NRC proposed the following:-
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">QR and NR enter a long term agreement (23 years) for QR to provide NR with access to the area defined by our current lease , sufficient to service National Rail's current train plan, at existing service quality and at a cost that reflects current operations and NR capital investment in the complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">QR and NR enter into a seven year agreement consistent with the long term access agreement in 1. above to provide for:- 
 2.1 QR to manage the allocation of access to terminal capacity for a defined area being TRACK A, new crane roads 1-6 and industrial roads 1-4 and hardstand between Track A and new crane road no 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">
 2.2 NR is guaranteed access consistent with the long term access agreement outlined in 1. above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">
 2.3 NR to maintain a right to load, unload and service National Rail trains and provide customer interface services for company customers including current IT and administrative systems and ingates and weighbridges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">
 2.4 QR to maintain a right to load, unload and service QR trains and provide customers interface services for their own customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">
 ..." (emphasis added)
 

433 It is not necessary to set out the remaining terms proposed in Mr Graham's letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">His proposal contained a concession by NRC because he did not insist on a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">Rather, what was put forward was a proposal for long term access by NRC so as to be able to service its current train plan while at the same time reserving to QR the right to load and unload its trains and service its own customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">However, the proposal was rejected by Mr O'Rourke in a letter dated 19 September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">434 Mr O'Rourke's letter of 19 September 2000 commenced by setting out QR's position with respect to the non-declared part of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">He said that:-
 
 &#8226; QR considered the AR terminal to be a strategic asset which was " the gateway to fulfilling our national ambitions " (emphasis added) and the bridge for the gauge change between Queensland and the rest of Australia; 
 &#8226; QR had not been allowed to participate in the acquisition of NRC on its privatisation and had little incentive to give away control of its only interstate asset;
 &#8226; QR wished, in the future, to operate its own services at AR "and not be beholden to an unknown potential competitor"; and
 &#8226; QR considered that the AR terminal was inefficiently operated and had spare capacity which was not being used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">

435 Mr O'Rourke said in his letter that whilst QR acknowledged NRC's preference to load and unload its own trains, a satisfactory dual or multi-operator arrangement could not be envisaged at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">436 Nevertheless, recognising the need for certainty in the sale of NRC, Mr O'Rourke stated that QR was prepared, inter alia, to:-
 
 "- discuss long-term (say 10 years with options to extend) access arrangements on a commercial basis at Acacia Ridge for National Rail or its purchaser; 
 - provide sufficient capacity for the existing level of NRC business ...; and 
 - recognise investments by National Rail in terminal improvements ... possibly by ...QR repaying National Rail for the written down costs..." 
 
 October 2000: Mr George's memorandum to Mr O'Rourke; concern about loss of potential bargaining chip 
 
437 On 9 October 2000, Mr Wilson wrote to Mr O'Rourke stating that Queensland Transport wished to finalise the issue of control and use of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">He described it as "a dominant freight transport node for Brisbane and ... the focal point of Queensland's rail linkage with the rest of Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">He said that there was a "virtual impossibility of the facility being economically duplicated in the foreseeable future".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">438 Mr Wilson went on to suggest track access for NRC in the form of a non-exclusive licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">He said that access charges should be on an equitable basis and that access charges should take account of NRC's expenditure on fixed infrastructure at Acacia Ridge since 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">He also said that he would advise the Commonwealth Department of Transport to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">439 Mr O'Rourke sent a copy of the letter to Mr George with a copy to Mr Cantwell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">The letter seems to have caused considerable consternation within QR, as revealed in Mr George's handwritten memorandum to Mr O'Rourke of 16 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">440 Mr George's memorandum is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">I will set out in full as follows:-
 
 "The attached is in my view 'out of line'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">It is fundamentally different to our last discussions with Helen and basically would make Acacia Ridge 'common use' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">
 
 On this basis the chances are QR would not get any capacity at the terminal --- as incumbency will strengthen NR's position and QR would have no greater rights than Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">
 
 Bruce has positioned QR by writing to the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">I am checking what powers QT have but neither Steve/myself believe they can get the terminal declared by the corridor assessment process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">
 
 My recommendation is that you ask Bruce why he has put an unagreed position to the Commonwealth in respect of a QR asset without the politeness to discuss with us in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">
 
 This undermines QR's position re Toll, and takes away a potential equity bargaining chip if it goes ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">
 
 I would welcome the opportunity to discuss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">" (emphasis added)
 

441 The references in Mr George's memorandum to "Helen", "Bruce" and "Steve" are to Helen Stehbens and Bruce Wilson of Queensland Transport, and Steven Cantwell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">442 On 20 October 2000, Mr O'Rourke wrote to Mr Dan Hunt, the Acting Director-General of Queensland Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">He said that QR's position was that with the exception of Industrial Roads 5 to 9 (ie a major part of the marshalling yards) which would be a common user facility managed by QR's NAG, the remainder of the AR terminal would be "[m]anaged and operated as an above-rail facility with access for National Rail developed in commercial arrangement with QR".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">443 Mr O'Rourke went on to say:-
 
 "I find it difficult that the Commonwealth has been advised of a position as I understand it that the whole of the terminal will be managed as a below-rail common user facility where QR itself might have some difficulty accessing what is its own terminal .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">It seems ironic to me that the Commonwealth can on one hand exclude QR from participating in the sale of its assets and thus restricting our expansion plans when on the other hand we are advising the Commonwealth that National Rail tenancy will be dealt with as a below-rail common user arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">
 
 I would like to discuss this matter with you so that QR can establish its future position with some certainty and most especially in view of the advanced QR/TOLL Joint Venture discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">" (emphasis added)
 

444 Mr Hunt replied to Mr O'Rourke's letter of 20 October 2000 on 30 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">He said that Queensland Transport's position had been consistently stated in earlier correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">He also said that the AR terminal was a part of the corridor and was needed because of its strategic importance in the context of s 215 of the Transport Infrastructure Act and because it provides access to many private sidings including QR's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">He continued:-
 
 " Queensland Transport's desired outcome is a common user interstate rail terminal and establishment of a common user marshalling yard (both standard gauge and Queensland gauge) to be managed by NAG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">No party would have exclusive access to a facility of strategic importance to the State and I believe it is in QR's interests to attract as much freight as possible through Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">" (emphasis added) 
 

445 Mr O'Rourke sent a copy of Mr Hunt's letter to Mr George with an instruction to follow up the letter with Queensland Transport and discuss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">Copies of the letter were also sent to four QR officers including Mr Oldfield and Mr Buckley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">In October 2000 Mr Oldfield and Mr Buckley were reporting to Mr George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">The copy letter is annotated with handwritten notes which were acknowledged in cross-examination of Mr Buckley to be in Mr George's handwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">446 Mr George's notes on the letter stated that QR disagreed with Queensland Transport's desired outcome of a common user interstate rail terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">As to Mr Hunt's statement that no party would have exclusive access and that it was in QR's interest to attract freight, Mr George stated:-
 
 "not necessarily --- ignores the strategic importance to QR in negotiations of reciprocal arrangements .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">" (emphasis added)
 
 November 2000: Further discussions and correspondence about different positions taken by NRC, QR and Queensland Transport 
 
447 On 6 November 2000, there was a meeting of eight QR personnel including Mr George, Mr Cantwell of the NAG, Mr Drew, who was QR's corporate counsel, Ms Calvisi from legal services and Mr Buckley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">448 The purpose of the meeting was to discuss QR's strategy in preparation for a meeting with Mr Hunt and Mrs Stehbens which had been arranged for 10 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">449 Notes of the meeting of 6 November 2000 were kept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">The notes commence by referring to the different positions taken by NRC, QR and Queensland Transport following recent discussions and correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">Queensland Transport's position was said to be that:-
 
 &#8226; the AR terminal should be common user, managed by QR's NAG;
 &#8226; no party to have exclusive access; and
 &#8226; NRC to be provided access, recognising its historic capacity and prior investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">

450 QR's position was stated to be that:-
 
 &#8226; QR's above rail group operate the AR terminal;
 &#8226; Industrial Roads 5 --- 9 (ie the marshalling yards) be designated common user, to be managed by NAG;
 &#8226; access be provided to NRC for sufficient capacity to handle its existing level of business, but not sterilising its capacity;
 &#8226; there be commercial charges for access, but recognising NRC's prior investment;
 &#8226; the AR terminal not be deemed an essential facility nor be declared for open access;
 &#8226; QR to deal with third parties on a strictly commercial basis; and
 &#8226; QR to be able to use the AR terminal either for equity in an interstate joint venture or " to secure access to ensure reciprocity to southern terminals eg Chullora, Islington etc ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">(emphasis added) 

451 NRC's position was stated to be that it preferred a lease rather than access, that it wished to operate the AR terminal or part of the terminal and that it wanted control of the terminal information system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">452 The notes then referred to discussion at the meeting about the implications and the possibility of the AR terminal being designated as rail corridor or commercial corridor land under s 215 of the Transport Infrastructure Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">The notes record the following:-
 
 "QT apparently consider they have the power to designate such a facility as of strategic importance to the State and effectively take control of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">This was clearly not the intent of this section of the Transport Infrastructure Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">QR would argue that the terminal was not of strategic importance to the State as part of a transport corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">This is because it is non corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">QR is also unaware of it being in a transport infrastructure strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">If QT pursued this avenue they would also end up with ownership of a terminal and potential responsibility for reimbursing NRC for their $17m improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">
 
 If this avenue is not pursued by QT, Government (via Treasury) have the power to declare the terminal under the QCA Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">As such, QR is vulnerable to QT taking direct action contrary to QR's commercial interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">" 
 

453 The notes went on to record that it was decided the best way forward would be to maintain QR's stance that the terminal was non-corridor and:-
 
 
 " Resolutely refuse to have the terminal declared or made a common user facility --- and therefore no appeal processes if capacity not available to a third party using reciprocity and our need to have easy access to our own terminal as a rationale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">" (emphasis added)
 

454 The notes concluded by stating that QR may not need to brief the Minister if an agreement could not be reached because Queensland Transport was "giving precedence to their regulatory role over their shareholding role".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">455 On 10 November 2000, Mr George sent the "final minutes" of the meeting to Mr Scheuber, Mr Cantwell, Mr Buckley and other QR personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">The "final minutes" were apparently a reference to the notes described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">456 On 6 December 2000, Mr O'Rourke reported to a QR Board meeting on the results of the meeting of 10 November 2000 between QR and Queensland Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">His written report stated that a medium term joint position was agreed between QR and Queensland Transport as follows:-
 
 &#8226; The AR terminal to be operated by QR above rail group;
 &#8226; Industrial Roads 5 to 9 and the southern access road to be common user and subject to access via the NAG; these roads were to be declared strategic rail corridor land under the Transport Infrastructure Act ; 
 &#8226; QR to provide NRC with commercial access providing sufficient capacity to meet its current requirements; and
 &#8226; QR would negotiate commercially with third parties (and NRC for expansion) for access to the AR terminal.</sentence>

 Mr Graham's letter of 13 November 2000; no obligation to grant long lease 
 
457 On 13 November 2000, Mr Graham replied to Mr O'Rourke's letter of 19 September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">He said he appreciated Mr O'Rourke's efforts to find a commercially satisfactory outcome but he said that Mr O'Rourke's position did:-
 
 "... not meet what we and our shareholders regard as the absolute minimum obligation of both QR and the State under the NRC Establishment Agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">" (emphasis added)
 

458 Mr Graham went on to refer to the purpose for which NRC was formed, as a commercially viable interstate rail freight business and, paraphrasing from the EA, that it would be given access to interstate rail assets for so long as it continued to operate the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">He said that this did not depend on NRC continuing to be owned by its present shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">He pointed out that all of NRC's capital city terminals were integrated into its on-line information system and that the AR terminal "is a fundamental part of this national intermodal logistics operation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">459 Mr Graham's letter continued as follows:-
 
 " We accept that, under the Establishment Agreement, QR has no obligation to transfer ownership or grant a long-term lease .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">What is required however, as a minimum, is access to the nominated area on commercial terms and conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">So that there is no misunderstanding, I attach a plan which shows this area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">Those terms must include the right to operate the nominated part of the terminal to load and unload trains and monitor and control the movement of freight into and out of the terminal area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">With QR's concurrence, we have made a substantial capital investment in the facilities necessary for such operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">Access without operational rights is unrealistic and uncommercial, particularly in the context of our now well established intermodal operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">To operate a commercially successful interstate rail freight business on a national basis requires this level of operatorship at all key terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">It is an integral part of interstate rail freight operations today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">" (emphasis added)
 

460 The plan attached by Mr Graham is reproduced below:-
 


 
 
461 Mr O'Rourke sent a copy of Mr Graham's letter of 13 November 2000 to Mr George with a request that they discuss it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">He also sent a copy to Mr Scheuber.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">462 Mr O'Rourke replied to Mr Graham's letter of 13 November 2000 on 6 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">He said that QR did not agree that NRC had the right under the EA to operate the nominated part of the AR terminal, to load and unload trains and to control the movement of freight into and out of that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">463 The letter of 6 December 2000 continued as follows:-
 
 "As previously advised, QR is prepared to provide access to National Rail .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">In this context, QR considers that access means "able to be entered, or entered upon' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">Taking account of the fact that Queensland is not a Shareholder State, QR believes that National Rail is granted sufficient access, provided it has the right of entry into the terminal, notwithstanding the intention that the terminal management functions are to be performed by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">" (emphasis added)
 
 February 2001: Further strategising by QR 
 
464 On or about 13 February 2001, QR produced a discussion paper entitled "Strategic Development Options and Issues for Acacia Ridge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">Mr Oldfield and Mr Buckley appear to have been involved in preparing the document because on 13 February 2001, Mr Peter Gardiner of the NAG sent an email to Mr Oldfield, with a copy to Mr Buckley, thanking him for the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">465 The strategic issues paper stated that in negotiating with NRC, the outcomes that QR might seek, included:-
 
 "QR be in a position to use the terminal asset as a lever for entry into the interstate markets, including possible entry into other NRC terminals on a reciprocal basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">" (emphasis added)
 

466 A similar statement appeared later in the paper, to the effect that the AR terminal is a strategic asset for QR because control of it ensures that QR has some bargaining power in future efforts to enter interstate freight markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">467 QR's legitimate outcomes were said to include being able to operate its own interstate trains, or trains in which it may have an interest, into the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">468 NRC's legitimate outcomes were said to include:-
 
 &#8226; certainty of access;
 &#8226; not disrupting the sale process or devaluing NRC;
 &#8226; control over service quality;
 &#8226; recognition of prior NRC investment at AR; and
 &#8226; ability to expand its business over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">

469 Under the heading "Commercial and Strategic Value", the paper said:-
 
 "Given that the NRC terminal is the key to the standard gauge access to Queensland , and that future business aspirations of QR are to go interstate in some form, it clearly makes no sense to give the asset away to a potential competitor , or in any way to lose control of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">" (emphasis added)
 

470 The paper discussed what is called "The Head-On Approach" which was the service of a notice to quit and legal action to recover control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">The pros and cons of this approach were set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">The cons included a concern that a political solution may be imposed because the strategy would devalue NRC for the purposes of the sale process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">471 There was also discussion of a possible joint venture with Toll.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">The paper commented that such a joint venture could end up controlling and managing both the interstate and intrastate terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">472 In his email of 13 February 2001, Mr Gardiner commented that:-
 
 "To date, to the best of my knowledge, NRC has not sought to block access to operators seeking access to the leased area, and in fact have been quite cooperative in determining the availability of capacity in the yard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">All NRC does ask is that third party operators seeking access to the yard not overly interrupt their existing operations and that some form of commercial agreement is in place between the parties before the commencement of new services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">
 
 NRC has shown reluctance to let new operators use the marshalling yard, but may be willing to let this occur, provided the above principles can be agreed in the first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">
 
 I would suggest that the inability of new operators to access the yard has been more about the unavailability of suitable schedules between Brisbane and Sydney, and the fact that there a [sic] no suitable common user arrival and departure roads within Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">I suspect that NRC may allow some form of access provide [sic] that suitable arrangements can be put in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">" 
 
 March 2001: QR Presentation to NRC 
 
473 On 8 March 2001, Mr Scheuber wrote to Mr Graham attaching a detailed proposal for access to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">Mr Scheuber stated that the regulatory environment and the national rail industry structure had changed dramatically since the EA and, because of this, QR was not able to offer exclusive access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">474 Mr Scheuber attached to his letter a copy of a "QR Presentation to NRC" which was apparently to be made the following day, 9 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">475 He also attached a draft Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">It is not necessary to set out the detail of either of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">March 2001: Mr Bredhauer proposes multi-user facility to Mr Anderson 
 
476 On 14 March 2001, Mr Steve Bredhauer, the Queensland Minister for Transport, wrote to Mr John Anderson, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Commonwealth Minister for Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">Mr Bredhauer stated that his objective was to increase the number of operators using the AR terminal, hence his efforts to secure multi-user access "and to comply with the obligations imposed by the Establishment Agreement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">477 Mr Bredhauer proposed a review of the facility and an interim arrangement for access by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">He also said:-
 
 "The agreement with QR is for the interim period until the review is completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">For that period, NR should have track access in the form of a non-exclusive licence or similar arrangement that would be made available by QR on a commercial basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">In determining the access charge consideration would be given to whether it is appropriate to take in to account NR's prior investment in fixed infrastructure at Acacia Ridge since its establishment in 1993 or whether it is appropriate that direct compensation be made to NR for those on-site investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">
 
 The Establishment Agreement is binding on the parties for its duration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">I am of the view that my proposals are within its requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">" 
 

478 Mr Anderson replied on 24 April 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">He said that he was advised that Mr Bredhauer's proposal was not consistent with the State of Queensland's obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">April 2001: QR briefing paper for Mr Bredhauer 
 
479 In April 2001, various QR personnel including Mr Buckley prepared a "background paper" for Mr Bredhauer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">It is unnecessary to set out the detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">It is sufficient to say that the paper sought to justify QR's proposal for a multi-user facility at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">Drafts of the paper were passed between QR personnel including Mr George and Mr Buckley before the final form was signed off by Mr George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">480 In commenting on one of the drafts Mr George said:-
 
 " Are we on strong ground in respect of whether QR has/has not ... given encouragement or mutually assumed with NR that, if NR invested capital on site, NR would receive a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">
 
 I suspect in the early days there may have been some thinking along those lines?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">" (emphasis added)
 
 Meeting of 10 May 2001 and letters between Mr Graham and Mr Scheuber 
 
481 On 10 May 2001, Mr Graham and others from NRC met with Mr George and others from QR to discuss QR's operational model for the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">Mr Graham described the meeting in a letter to Mr Scheuber of 15 May 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">Mr Graham said in the letter that he agreed that operational modelling was essential to understand "the capacity limitations and service quality implications of different operating paradigms for the container terminal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">482 Mr Graham stated in the letter that at the start of the meeting Mr George invited comment on NRC's reaction to the presentation in Brisbane on 9 March 2001, as to which Mr Graham commented:-
 
 &#8226; NRC nominated the AR terminal in Corporate Plan No 1 in April 1992;
 &#8226; the three year lease was not in substitution for NRC's nomination of the AR terminal;
 &#8226; the Queensland Government's obligation is to provide access to NRC, not necessarily in the form of a lease , but QR agreed to a lease in fulfilment of NRC's nomination; and
 &#8226; access should not be confused with NRC's right of operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">That function was transferred to NRC and agreed in writing on 4 April 1993 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">(emphasis added) 

483 Mr Graham offered, without prejudice, to consider an alternative form of access agreement other than a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">484 Mr Scheuber replied on 29 May 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">He said that QR had not received a copy of NRC's Corporate Plan No 1 "wherein you state you nominated the Acacia Ridge facility".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">July 2001: More QR strategising 
 
485 By email dated 9 July 2001, Mr Buckley sent a confidential draft negotiation strategy for the AR terminal to Mr Alan Williams of Queensland Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">The email stated that Mr Buckley was still receiving comments from QR "internal stakeholders" such as NAG, Corporate Counsel, Property, Mainline and Regional Freight, and that he did not have endorsement from the CEO or the Board for the strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">Nevertheless, it was sent as an "informal" early draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">486 The draft negotiation strategy included the following outcome to be sought by QR:-
 
 " To use the terminal asset as leverage for entry into interstate markets, including possible entry into other NRC terminals on a reciprocal basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">" (emphasis added)
 

487 The draft negotiation strategy also included the following statement:-
 
 "Clause 14 of the Third Amendment Agreement to the Establishment Agreement made in 1999 provides that on the sale date unless otherwise agreed by the parties, none of the parties will have any further rights or obligations under the Establishment Agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">This can be used to QR's/QT's advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">" (emphasis added)
 
 31 August 2001: QR seeks approval from Queensland Government to terminate NRC's tenancy 
 
488 On 31 August 2001, Mr Scheuber wrote to Mr Bredhauer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">He referred to an announcement made on 24 August 2001 by the Commonwealth, NSW and Victorian Governments of the combined sale of NRC and Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">Mr Scheuber said that given QR's strategy to regain control of the AR terminal, he sought to give notice to terminate NRC's monthly tenancy effective from the sale date and:-
 
 "withdraw any implied commitment or understanding that proposed new arrangements or grandfathering existing arrangements at the terminal will apply to the new owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">" 
 

489 Mr Scheuber's letter was apparently referred by Mr Bredhauer to Mr Wilson, who replied on 26 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">Mr Wilson said that it should be assumed that NRC's access entitlements would apply to the new owners and that Queensland Transport would not support QR:-
 
 &#8226; giving notice to NRC to terminate the tenancy from the date of sale; or
 &#8226; "reneging" on NRC, or its new owners, having sufficient capacity, provided on a commercial basis, to operate the AR terminal at its pre-sale level of business activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">
 December 2001: QR's access undertaking 
 
490 By a document published on or about 1 December 2001, QR gave an undertaking for the purposes of the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997 (Qld) (" Competition Act ") providing a framework to manage negotiations with access seekers for rail transport infrastructure on the North Coast Line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">491 The preamble to the undertaking states that it has been prepared in accordance with the Competition Act and that its intention is to ensure that access is negotiated in a competitively neutral environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">492 The activities which an access seeker may seek to carry out on the rail infrastructure include mainline running of a train from its origin to destination including the use of passing loops and the loading and unloading of trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">493 Part 3 of the undertaking is headed "Ringfencing Arrangements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">It states that QR has established NAG as a business group separate from QR Operational Business Groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">The primary function of NAG is said to be to managing the provision of Below Rail services, including negotiation of access with access seekers and management of access agreements with access holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">494 Part 4 of the undertaking sets out the process to be followed for requests for access and the negotiation of access agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">It is not necessary to set out the details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">495 Part 6 of the undertaking deals with pricing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">It states that QR's primary objective in developing access charges is to achieve revenue adequacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">This is specified as revenue sufficient to achieve full recovery of efficient costs including an adequate rate of return on the value of the assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">496 Limits on price differentiation are set.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">QR states that it will not differentiate access charges between access seekers or access holders for the purpose of adversely affecting competition within a relevant market, including for the purpose of preventing or hindering access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">497 Paragraph 6.1.4 of the undertaking states:-
 
 "In developing Internal Access Agreements ... QR will not establish Access Charges for QR Train Services for the purpose of preventing or hindering access by a third party access seeker into any market in competition with the QR Operational Business Group providing those QR Train services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">" 
 

498 Part 7 of the undertaking is headed "Capacity Management".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">It states that QR will perform scheduling, train control and associated services in accordance with the Network Management Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">These are set out in a schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">499 Paragraph 7.4.1 provides that access rights will be allocated to the first access seeker with whom QR can negotiate and execute an acceptable access agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">500 Reference Tariff Schedules are set out in Schedule F to the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">The Reference Tariff set out in paragraph 3.1 of Schedule F for a nominated reference train service is extraordinarily complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">February 2002: Completion of sale of shares in NRC; more strategising by QR 
 
501 Completion of the sale of the shares in NRC owned by the Commonwealth, NSW and Victorian Governments took place on 21 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">502 On 14 February 2002, a week before the completion date, Mr Buckley sent an email to an officer of the Treasury of the Queensland Government stating that QR's objectives at the AR terminal were to:-
 
 &#8226; achieve a commercial return, including a return on assets;
 &#8226; ensure that capacity throughput was maximised; and
 &#8226; leverage the AR terminal so as to ensure that QR was granted reciprocal assets to interstate terminals on reasonably commercial terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">

503 Mr Buckley said in the email that cl 14 of the Third Amending Agreement provided that on the sale date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, none of the parties would have any further rights or obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">504 Mr Buckley went on to say that it was QR's intention to negotiate a non-exclusive access arrangement at the AR terminal with NRC, and potentially other operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">He said QR would not countenance any proposal for a long term lease and that QR would be the manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">September 2002: Strategic options for QR 
 
505 In September 2002, QR's NAG produced a discussion paper entitled "Strategic Options for the Management and Operation of the Acacia Ridge Standard Gauge Yard".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">The paper was dated 12 September 2002 and states that it was prepared by NAG in consultation with the Coal and Freight Services (C&amp;FS), Corporate Counsel and Property sections of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">506 The paper commenced by stating that the current strategy for resolution of the question of access was based on QR retaining ownership and regaining management control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">507 The potential outcomes sought by QR included use of:-
 
 "the terminal asset as leverage for Interail's entry into interstate markets, including possible entry into other Pacific National terminals on a reciprocal basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">" 
 

508 Interail Australia ("Interail") is QR's interstate rail freight operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">509 The paper commented that if NAG managed the terminal on an open access basis, reciprocal rights could not be guaranteed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">The paper also stated that lack of full operational control over a major freight terminal in the Brisbane area was a " major strategic disadvantage against a competitor like Pacific National" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">510 Reference was made to Queensland Transport's perspective that it was not acceptable for QR to be the terminal operator because of a perception of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">To overcome this, it was said to be necessary for NAG to manage the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">511 Later the paper recorded that:-
 
 "Terminal management is not core business and Network Access does not currently have the skills expertise or systems to manage or operate a container terminal .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">" (emphasis added)
 

512 The paper contained at least one other acknowledgment of QR's inability to properly manage or operate a terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">513 The perspective of C&amp;FS was stated to be that it was strategically important for QR to control at least one major Brisbane Freight terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">C&amp;FS was not opposed to NAG operating the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">514 The paper also contained discussion of Interail's perspectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">These were said to be that without access on commercially acceptable terms, Interail could not operate interstate services to or from Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">From Interail's perspective:-
 
 " QR control of the Acacia Ridge interstate terminal could be critical to Interail's national expansion plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">Interail is more likely to negotiate reciprocal rights of access to other interstate terminals if QR can regain control of the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">" (emphasis added)
 

515 QR's above rail interests were also said to be control of a major interstate terminal in Brisbane as a "lever for national expansion" and securing access to the AR terminal and the marshalling yards on fair and equitable terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">516 As to QR's "property interest", that is, ownership of the AR terminal, the following appeared in the paper:-
 
 " If QR were simply interested in realising a return from the terminal, then it would be appropriate to lease it to the highest bidder to operate it as they wish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">QR would be basically indifferent to who leases the terminal --- in fact it would be reasonable to sell it if the maximum value could be extracted from the purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">
 
 QR's (Interail's) interstate expansion opportunities, together with C&amp;FS' desire to control a major Brisbane terminal, would not benefit from this option .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">" (emphasis added)
 

517 The conclusion which the paper reached was that QR's strategic ambitions as an interstate non-bulk operator could be achieved if the AR terminal was independently managed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">The paper went on to say that it might even be acceptable for PN to operate the terminal under contract to the independent terminal operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">However, no such possibility was reflected in QR's proposed Draft Terminal Services Agreement to which I refer later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">518 The discussion paper's conclusions continued as follows:-
 
 "QR's vision/mission could clearly contemplate entering a terminal management/operating business, potentially on a national or global basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">
 
 However, it would need to make a significant investment in systems and expertise to be successful in such a venture (its track record in terminal management and operations is poor ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">On a national basis, Patricks consider their core competence to be terminal management (and they own/manage a number of shipping terminals plus Pacific National has control of every major rail terminal), so we will confront a major grizzly bear if we try to enter that market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">
 
 Terminal management is a critical component of managing a supply chain; whether that is a shipping terminal, coal terminal or key yards such as Jilalan and Callemondah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">The problem eventually becomes one of best managing the capacity available from the facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">" (emphasis added)
 

519 Section 5 of the paper stated that once QR determined whether to be in the terminal management business there would be a range of options available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">Seven options were listed ranging from NAG managing the entire facility to various joint ventures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">The only options said to be in NRC's interests were retaining the status quo and, possibly, sale of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">December 2002 --- February 2003: Preparation for issue of notice to quit 
 
520 On 2 December 2002, the Board of QR resolved to endorse a strategy set out in a detailed submission to the Board calling for termination of the PN tenancy and resumption of control by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">The submission included an "endorsement by Senior Executive/Chief Executive" and was signed by Mr Cantwell, Mr George and Mr Scheuber in late November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">521 The submission set out a background statement referring to the history of the matter from the EA to the sale of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">In cross-examination of Mr Scheuber, it was put to him that some of the material in the background statement was inaccurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">I will refer to this later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">522 Reference was made in the background statement to the Third Amending Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">It was said that unless NRC finalised a lease or access agreement prior to the sale of NRC, the successful bidder would have no basis for striking a lease or access arrangement other than through commercial negotiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">523 The submission also stated that undertakings were made to the NRC shareholders, prior to sale, that access to the AR terminal would be provided on a commercial basis and that consideration would be given to recognition of NRC's prior investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">524 The policy of Queensland Transport was said to be:-
 
 "- Ownership of the terminal resides with QR/QT; 
 - Access should be provided to Pacific National including sufficient capacity to conduct their business; 
 - Maximisation of rail freight traffic through the AR facility; 
 - Common user access to the interstate marshalling yard; 
 - Multi-user access to the interstate terminal; 
 - Management and control of the asset by a neutral entity such as ...NAG; 
 - Reservation of interstate terminal capacity for interstate traffic; 
 - Access by Third Party Operators to private sidings; and 
 - Servicing of Third Party Operator Train Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">" 
 

525 The submission stated that QR needed to manage the AR terminal in order to maximise return, access and throughput.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">It said that QR may be able to obtain an additional rental yield of $600,000 per annum over the existing rent of $800,000 per annum paid by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">But it said that the real opportunity for QR was:
 
 &#8226; facilitation of increased rail freight at the expense of road;
 &#8226; rationalisation of narrow and standard gauge intermodal operations resulting in shunting savings in excess of $3 million per annum; and
 &#8226; avoiding intrastate intermodal terminal capital expenditure in excess of $10 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">

526 Under the heading "Strategy", the submission stated that the probability of reaching a compromise with PN was "negligible given there are no positive outcomes for PN".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">This was apparently a reference to the options listed in NAG's discussion paper of 12 September 2002 which stated, in effect, that the only positive outcome for PN was retention of the status quo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">527 The proposed strategy was for QR to take control of the existing terminal facility and marshalling yard from PN which would facilitate the establishment of a multi-user terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">528 There was also an analysis of risks of the strategy, including what was termed "Government Political Risk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">This was said to be that PN may be able to exert pressure on the Commonwealth or State Governments to make QR accept a compromise.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1239">530 The draft business case was prepared by NAG; the document indicated that the contact officer was Mr Ian Wilson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">531 The objectives stated in the draft business case include increasing the return on the AR terminal, changing its control, and utilising the AR terminal in line with QR's business needs and Queensland Transport policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">The document recommends rejection of the current tenancy arrangements with PN because the current rental return is said to be below market value and because it will impede QR's ability to enhance its own operations through the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">Reference is also made to the difficulty of establishing a common user facility in the marshalling yards under the existing tenancy arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">532 The benefits to QR stated in the draft business case include:-
 
 &#8226; increasing the return to QR from "its Acacia Ridge assets and consequently reduce the implicit subsidy of NRC";
 &#8226; using unutilised capacity;

 &#8226; moving existing Moolabin terminal volumes to the AR terminal; and
 &#8226; providing access to QR and third parties.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1245">534 The Board resolved that simultaneously with the issue of the notice to quit, an offer was to be made to PN for a 12 month lease or licence, with control during that period, as well as an access agreement to the marshalling yard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">535 The Board of QR also resolved that at the time when the notice was issued, PN would be advised that QR's intention was for the AR terminal to be managed as follows:-
 
 &#8226; common user facility for the marshalling yards; and
 &#8226; multi-user facility for the balance, with a "transparent access regime" which would accommodate PN "as a core customer with capacity entitlements".</sentence>

<sentence id="s1270">550 Application 1 was said to have been made on 2 June 2003; it was for three standard gauge services per week on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, arriving at 18.30 and departing at 00.30.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1298">1 January 2005: QR's offer to PN of a Licence 
 
563 On 1 January 2005, QR offered PN a licence to enter and use the AR terminal (excluding the Administration Building) from 14 March 2005 to 13 March 2006 for an occupation fee of $2,568,500 per annum, payable in equal monthly instalments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">Principle features of the licence are as follows:-
 
 &#8226; Clause 3.2 provides that PN is given a right of occupation in common with any other persons licensed by QR; cl 10.2 provides that QR may grant a license to any other person "as it sees fit" and PN agrees to cooperate in the joint use of the premises;
 &#8226; The licence fee has been calculated without regard to prior works undertaken by PN at the AR terminal (including the works listed at Schedule C of the licence and those identified in the affidavit of Mr Lonergan sworn 21 May 2004).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">Pursuant to cl 5.2, upon payment by QR to PN of $4,372,000 on the date the licence terminates, PN has no right, title or interest in these prior works; 
 &#8226; PN is not to alter the licenced premises or construct any improvement on the licenced premises, nor do anything likely to disturb the efficient operation of the operation of the services or any railway at the AR terminal, nor interfere with QR's operation of rail activities; see cl 8.2 and 8.3.4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">Furthermore, cl 14.3 provides that PN is not to damage the licenced premises, nor, in the performance of its works under the licence, cause unnecessary inconvenience to other licensees or disrupt ongoing terminal operations at AR;
 &#8226; Pursuant to cl 11.2, PN is not to make any alternation to installation, ie electrical, communication, access or security installations, on the licensed premises without QR's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
 &#8226; Clause 12.9 provides that PN has no claim against QR, nor is PN entitled to terminate the licence solely because services at the AR terminal fail to operate or QR shuts down or removes any services in order to repair, maintain or replace them; and
 &#8226; QR has the right, under cl 13, to terminate the licence on seven days notice if, inter alia, the licence fee is seven days in arrears, if PN fails to observe any covenant contained in the licence, or if the Corridor Access Agreement is terminated for any reason.</sentence>

 The Draft Terminal Services Agreement 
 
564 On or about 9 March 2005, QR submitted a draft terminal services agreement to PN ("the Draft Terminal Services Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">565 The Draft Terminal Services Agreement was expressed to continue for an Initial Term, defined to mean the period from 10 March 2006 to 5 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">566 Provision was made for a Renewal Term of five years, subject to there being in force a Corridor Access Agreement for a period which includes all of the Renewal Term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">567 Provision was also made for QR to consider any request by PN for a further term beyond the Renewal Term but this was on the basis that QR "may refuse to do so for any reason in its absolute discretion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">568 Clause 4.2 provided for the grant to PN of non-exclusive access rights to the AR terminal and the marshalling yards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">569 Provision was made in cl 5.1 and Schedule 2 of the Draft Terminal Services Agreement for PN to pay QR service charges for the specified services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">The charges were calculated on the proviso that the trains not carry in aggregate more than 20,830 TEU per month (ie 249,960 TEU per annum) which was thought to be the extent of usage by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">Provision was made for PN to apply to QR to increase the aggregate TEU in any month by up to 10%, but QR was to have no obligation to agree to the increase and "may decline to accept that increased amount for any reason in its absolute discretion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">570 Clause 6.7 contained a provision which excluded any obligation on QR to provide services to PN in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1311">The clause was as follows:-
 
 "6.7 The Terminal Manager may decline to provide Services 
 
 (a) Without limiting any other provision of this agreement, the Terminal Manager has no obligation to provide the Services to the Rail Operator in the following circumstances:- (i) if a Train does not arrive or depart during the Permitted Time, or otherwise in accordance with the Timetable, however the Terminal Manager agrees to use its reasonable endeavours to provide the Services in respect of that Train; (ii) if the Rail Operator (or their agents or contractors) have failed to comply with a Law relevant to loading, unloading, or transport of such goods, or have failed to comply with the Terminal Protocols.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">(b) If the Terminal Manager does not provide the Services in the circumstances referred to in clause 6.7(a), the Rail Operator will comply with the Terminal Manager's directions in relation to removal of the Train or of any goods from the Terminal.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1321">The amendments were intended to meet a number of objections made by PN to the initial draft as raised by Senior Counsel in his cross-examination of QR witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">The principal amendments are as follows:-
 
575 Firstly, in relation to the provision of services to the Rail Operator, cl 6.7(i) has been amended as follows: "Terminal manager agrees to use its reasonable best endeavours to provide the services...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">576 The second principle amendment concerns an alteration to the regime for the maximum monthly TEUs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">Schedule 2(a)(i) is amended as follows:-
 
 "(a) Services 
 
 (i) In consideration for payment of the charges referred to in paragraph 1(b) below, the Terminal Manager will during each month of the Term provide the relevant services outlined in paragraphs (A) to (E) below ("Terminal Services") for the relevant specific Trains listed in the Timetable, provided that those Trains do not carry in aggregate during that month greater than 20830 TEU a TEU greater than the TEU for that month as referred to in Schedule 4 (" Allocated Monthly TEU ") (subject to paragraph (ii) below and clauses 7.5 and 7.6 of this agreement ), and provided that no Train exceeds the maximum length specified for that Train in the Timetable;

578 As with Schedule 2 in the March draft, the maximum TEU may be increased by 10% if the Rail Operator provides written notice, however a critical difference is contained in the amendments to subsection (ii) of Schedule 2(a), which I shall set out:-
 
 "(ii) The aggregate Allocated Monthly TEU of 20,830 referred to in paragraph (i) above Schedule 4 as at the date of this agreement may be permanently increased by up to 10% in any particular month by the Rail Operator by giving the Terminal Manager written notice at least 2 months prior to seeking that increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">Once the Rail Operator has given such a notice, the increased figure will be deemed to be the figure for the aggregate Allocated m Monthly TEU in the relevant month for the purposes of paragraph (i) above, and will also be deemed to be the figure for the aggregate Allocated m Monthly TEU referred to in paragraph (b) (i) below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">However, the Allocated Monthly TEU for each month may only be increased under this paragraph (ii) by a maximum of 10% above the TEU for that month listed in Schedule 4 as at the date of this agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">Any other increase will be dealt with under clauses 7.5 and 7.6 of this agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">" 
 
 

579 Reference is also made in Schedule 2(a)(i) to cl 7.5 and 7.6, which have been added to the July draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">Clause 7.5 relates to additional monthly throughput, and provide as follows:-
 
 "7.5 Additional Monthly Throughput

<sentence id="s1330">For the avoidance of doubt , a written request by the Rail Operator may not seek to reduce the Allocated Monthly TEU .</sentence>

 (iii) the Expansion would create capacity significantly in excess of the Additional Monthly Throughput requested by the Rail Operator and the requirements of other users;

 (v) the Rail Operator and other users have not entered into agreed and binding commitments to use the capacity (including capacity created by the Expansion) of the Terminal (such commitments to include agreement as to the price to be paid for all Terminal Services following an Expansion); 
 (vi) having regard to the commitments referred to in subparagraph (v) above, in the Terminal Manager's reasonable opinion the Terminal Manager will not achieve a rate of return over the useful life of any capital investment necessary to fund the Expansion equal to or greater than 15% per annum; 
 (vii) having regard to the commitments referred to in subparagraph (v) above, the use of the Terminal Manager's funds for the Expansion is not, in the Terminal Manager's opinion, economically justifiable; or

<sentence id="s1343">THE EVIDENCE OF THE PRINCIPAL WITNESSES 
 Mr Graham's evidence 
 
584 Mr Graham was Managing Director of NRC from 1 February 1992 to 21 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">He had overall responsibility for the business operations of NRC and provided the Board of NRC with advice on strategic issues affecting NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">585 Mr Graham gave evidence about the interstate freight market and the establishment of NRC, including his understanding of the objectives of NRC and the means by which these objectives were pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">He gave an account of the nature of communications between NRC, the Queensland Government and QR, and in particular, the negotiations between NRC and QR over the transfer of control and access rights to AR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">586 Prior to commencing with NRC in 1992, Mr Graham was Chief Operating Officer of the NSW State Rail Authority for nearly four years, and believed he had developed a good understanding of the interstate freight market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">He said that from 1987, the rail market's share in interstate freight slowly declined and by 1992, his view was that the rail industry was dominated by unreliable rail services and high cost structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">587 Mr Graham's evidence was that the interstate freight market was highly competitive, with road transport being the key competitor to rail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">He understood that the key reason for establishing the NRC was to develop a national interstate rail system which was operated on a commercially viable basis, so as to compete successfully with road transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">Mr Graham formed this understanding through his reading of the EA, the NRC Act and the Task Force Report, coupled with his discussions with Mr Butcher shortly after he commenced work with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">588 In his opinion, in order for NRC to achieve this objective, it had to offer competitive services on each rail corridor, increase reliability of its services, improve efficiency, and decrease costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">Mr Graham described the range of significant financial and operational improvements which he believed NRC needed to address in pursuit of these goals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">His evidence was that only because NRC had acquired control of key rail terminals in Victoria, NSW and Queensland, including AR, was it successful in achieving each of these goals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">589 Mr Graham gave evidence that shortly after he commenced with NRC in 1992, he and Mr Butcher had meetings with all the parties to the EA and their respective rail authorities to discuss the objectives of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">A primary purpose of these meetings was to identify the assets and functions which would be transferred to NRC, and determine how they would be transferred so that the Corporate Plan could be developed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">From February 1992 to April 1993, Mr Graham was involved in determining which assets and functions NRC would nominate for transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">590 From the outset, and indeed at all relevant times, Mr Graham's understanding of the EA was that any access rights granted to NRC pursuant to the EA would be for a long time, if not permanently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">He understood that it was for NRC to nominate to the State of Queensland any assets owned or controlled by the State or QR which was required by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">He also understood that the State of Queensland had a discretion as to how it provided long term access, that is to say by way of ownership, lease or an access agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">He understood the discretion had not been exercised at any time during his period in office at NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">591 Mr Graham's evidence was that although the State of Queensland had a choice as to the form of access rights which were granted:-
 
 "the minimum to which NRC was legally entitled was access for as long as NRC conducted national interstate rail freight operations on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">" 
 

592 He acknowledged in cross-examination that the minimum content of the State of Queensland's obligations did not require the grant of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">But he said that the access rights granted must contain all the elements necessary to ensure NRC's viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">593 Mr Graham accepted that it was a matter of policy for the State of Queensland, rather than QR, as to whether ownership would be transferred, or a lease or access rights granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">He did not recall considering whether the decision would be made by the State or by QR but he was of the view that in a practical sense the negotiations were undertaken with QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">He expected that the State of Queensland would cause QR to fulfil the State's obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">594 Mr Graham gave evidence under cross-examination that NRC's investment in the AR terminal was made on the strength of something more fundamental than his personal assumption about the effect of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">He said the decision to invest was based on rights embodied in legislation passed by the Queensland Parliament, that is to say, the NRC Act , given effect by QR and acted upon in every respect by QR from early 1992 until the change of position letter in March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">He also relied on discussions with Mr Hamill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">595 Mr Graham did not depart from this evidence at any time in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">He accepted that his recollection of discussions with Mr Hamill was very general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">But he emphasised that nothing was said by Mr O'Rourke or Mr Hamill between 1992 and March 1997 which was inconsistent with his understanding of QR's obligations under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">It is plain from his evidence that he did not rely on any statement by Mr Hamill that if the State of Queensland did not become a shareholder it would nevertheless give a long term lease to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">He simply could not recollect the detail of his conversations with Mr Hamill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">He relied on "something far more fundamental" namely the commitment made by the State of Queensland in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">596 It was put to Mr Graham that the improvements to the AR terminal were made at a time when NRC's only rights were those set out in the 1993 real estate lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">Mr Graham did not accept that this reflected the total position, because sitting behind the investment was "the very fundamental undertaking" in the EA of long term access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">597 When it was put to him that he was willing to proceed with the investments notwithstanding that a long term lease was not in place, Mr Graham replied:-
 
 "I did not see any substantial risk associated with the actions that we were undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">This lease provided a three-year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">A three-year term in isolation was not a sound basis for proceeding with the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">The reason that I'm keen to proceed with the investment is again not based on the tenure of the lease, it's based on the very unequivocal undertaking, in my view, at that time of the Queensland Government in the Establishment Agreement to provide long-term access to the facility , and if we were to deliver on the objectives of our shareholding and getting on and expanding the capacity of the Acacia Ridge terminal, which was constraining our business voltage and was vitally important to us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">" (emphasis added)
 

598 Later in his cross-examination Mr Graham referred to the "unequivocal commitment" of the Queensland Government in the EA for long term access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">He described the EA as the foundation of long term certainty and he referred again to the complementary legislation in the NRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">599 Mr Graham made it plain that NRC did not consider that the three year term of the 1993 real estate lease was in substitution for the rights and obligations contained in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">600 Mr Graham agreed that his understanding, namely that the State of Queensland had committed to ensuring that NRC would be provided with access in a way which would make it commercially viable, came from his reading of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">He said that this understanding dated from early 1992, and gave the following evidence in cross-examination:-
 
 "But, equally, you had not discussed with Mr Hamill or Mr O'Rourke or anyone else from the government whether they agreed with your reading of the Establishment Agreement in that way?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">--- No, I hadn't discussed whether they agreed with my reading, that's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">
 
 So essentially you were relying on your own reading of the Establishment Agreement as to the long-term rights NRC would have had at Acacia Ridge?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">
 --- And remain happy to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">" 
 

601 Mr Graham accepted that access on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability did not necessarily involve NRC being in control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">Such access could be satisfied in other ways, eg guarantees as to capacity, price and service quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">It was for this reason that he was prepared to negotiate such an agreement in September 2000, so long as NRC's requirements as to capacity, cost and service quality were assured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">602 The following exchange took place in cross-examination:-
 
 "I wasn't asking you about what the lease contained, I was asking about NRC's policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">Isn't it right it was NRC's policy to wish to only take a short-term lease over Acacia Ridge outside the provisions of the Establishment Agreement so that the question of what rights would eventually be transferred under the Establishment Agreement, be it ownership, lease or access, could be put off to the future?---I don't think it's fair to simply ascribe the desire for a short-term lease just to National Rail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">The policy position of National Rail, as I recall it at the time, was that we were not prepared to accept a short-term lease substituting for the longer term obligations to provide lease or access under the Establishment Agreement .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">I believe there were also matters at the time within the Queensland Environment ..." (emphasis added)
 

603 It was put to Mr Graham that NRC hoped to enter into a short term lease in the expectation that the State of Queensland might become a shareholder, thus providing ownership or a lease of the AR terminal without the payment of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">Mr Graham did not agree that there was a hope or expectation but he acknowledged the benefits of having the State of Queensland as a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">He accepted that there would be a saving of $600,000 per annum in rent (as it was in August 1993).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">604 Mr Graham's evidence was that notwithstanding the absence of a long term lease, the bulk of NRC's investment of about $200 million in the East Coast Strategy was made on the "very clear representations of both the Queensland Government and Queensland Rail to that point in time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">Underlying this was the "absolute long-term commitment of the Queensland Government embedded in the [EA]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">He made it clear, as he did when describing other investments in the AR terminal, that NRC was relying on the future exercise of the discretion under cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">605 Even though some further expenditure on the East Coast Strategy was approved by the Board of NRC after the change of position letter, Mr Graham's evidence was that the expenditure had to be viewed "against the backdrop of the unequivocal commitment" of the Queensland Government to the establishment and viability of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">606 Mr Graham said that the commitment of the Queensland Government to long term access, as contained in the EA, was a sufficient justification for further expenditure even after Mr O'Rourke's letter of 15 April 1998 stating that QR intended to take control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">607 Mr Graham described the features of the AR terminal which made it of strategic importance to NRC and an integral part of the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">608 When the dispute arose with QR, NRC did not give consideration to the construction of an alternative terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">Mr Graham said he could vaguely recall considering, in the late 1990s, a Greenfield site south of Acacia Ridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">But it was only a vague recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">609 Mr Graham was taken in cross-examination to the Board Papers in which the implications of the Hilmer Report were considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">He said that the issue of third party access had been recognized in the Heads of Government Agreement some years before the Hilmer Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">But he accepted that by 1997 there was a very real possibility that third parties wished to use NRC's track for the purposes of interstate rail freight between Brisbane and Sydney and Brisbane and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">610 Mr Graham's evidence was that loss of control of the AR terminal would have a substantial adverse impact on NRC's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">He referred to the integration of NRC's terminals and the IT system which enabled NRC to track the location of a customer's container anywhere in the NRC system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">611 Mr Graham seemed to me to be a reliable witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">I accept his evidence, subject to any specific observations stated below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">Mr Butcher's evidence 
 
612 The effect of Mr Butcher's evidence was that he appreciated that the State of Queensland had not exercised its discretion under cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">In cross-examination he accepted that at the relevant time, he had not appreciated the fact that the EA provided for the granting of mere access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">His evidence was that he could not recall any discussions with QR or the State of Queensland which contemplated mere access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">613 Mr Butcher gave oral evidence of a conversation with Mr Hamill that took place on 18 December 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">He understood that Mr Hamill was speaking on behalf of the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">It was Mr Butcher's understanding that Mr Hamill's statement that there would be a long term lease was an indication of Mr Hamill's present intention about how the State of Queensland might exercise its discretion at some future time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">614 Mr Butcher gave evidence that he had met with Mr O'Rourke on three or four occasions in 1992 --- 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">He said he could not recall the specific words spoken at the meetings but he believed that Mr O'Rourke was "fully supportive of NRC and its assumption of control of the terminal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">615 His understanding of the EA was that it provided for the parties to allow NRC to operate its own terminals and that the EA provided for NRC to take over all terminals, whether in a State or an Other State, ie Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">As previously mentioned, he was not aware at any relevant time that the grant of access rights was an available option for the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">616 Mr Butcher was an honest witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">His lack of knowledge of the access option affects PN's case but it does not adversely affect Mr Butcher's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">Mr Hanscomb's evidence 
 
617 Mr Hanscomb gave evidence that his note of 20 June 1995, in which he said that "QR accepted the principle" of a long term lease, accorded with his recollection of the conversation at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">618 It was put to Mr Hanscomb in cross-examination that this note merely stated NRC's preference; he resisted this suggestion, and said that Mr O'Rourke had accepted the principle that QR would grant a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">619 Mr Hanscomb was involved in the negotiation of the three year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">He said that in negotiating it, the parties were "in effect" negotiating the terms of the long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">But he accepted that this was never expressly stated in the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">Nor could he identify any piece of correspondence in which that was said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">620 Mr Hanscomb was not an entirely satisfactory witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">He tended to be dismissive of the cross-examiner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">His stated understanding of the effect of the EA was, in part, at odds with the views expressed by him in a contemporaneous paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">Nevertheless, I would accept much of his evidence, although in the end it was of marginal relevance because his state of mind was not to be attributed to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">Mr O'Rourke's evidence 
 
621 Mr O'Rourke was CEO of Queensland Railways from 1 July 1991 to 1 July 1995 when he became CEO of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">He held that position until his retirement on 15 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">He had a long career in the railway industry, particularly with the State Rail Authority of NSW, and was the Queensland Commissioner for Railways from 8 October 1990 until his appointment the following year as CEO of Queensland Railways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">622 Mr O'Rourke was the NSW representative on the NFI Committee in 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">He was familiar with, and supported, the recommendations of the Task Force Report produced in early 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">623 After the delivery of the Task Force Report, Mr O'Rourke sat on the Committee of Officials along with, among others, Mr Moore-Wilton, which considered the equity and funding arrangements for the NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">624 Mr O'Rourke was aware of the massive losses being incurred nationally on the interstate freight business at the time of the Task Force Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">However, he said that Queensland's deficit was quite small, probably only in the order of $12 million to $13 million per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">This was because Queensland had only a small interstate freight business based upon its 100 kilometres of standard gauge track from the AR terminal to the border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">625 At the time when the EA was signed, Mr O'Rourke was "supportive of the NRC concept".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">He believed that NRC would be the operator of the national interstate rail freight business and that it would control the assets of the business, including railway tracks and terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">626 As to the assets of the business in Queensland, Mr O'Rourke believed that the AR terminal and the standard gauge track to the border would be identified by NRC as the assets it required to conduct the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">He apparently held this belief on the basis of his reading of the EA and his knowledge of the background to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">627 Mr O'Rourke believed, when the EA was executed, that those assets would be made available to NRC by sale, lease or a grant of access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">He said that it was only from about April 1993 that he turned his mind to the question of which form of rights would be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">He considered that NRC's use of the assets would be on commercial terms agreed between NRC and Queensland Railways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">He did not hold the view that access would be given on terms which ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">628 He conceded in cross-examination that the corporate thinking of QR in August 1991 was that QR would deal with NRC's eventual tenure by a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">629 Mr O'Rourke also conceded in cross-examination that the three year lease was merely a transitional arrangement and that it was clear on 4 April 1993 that after the transition period there would be a long lease or perhaps ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">As I said in the introduction, he conceded that in April 1993, control of the AR terminal was transferred in anticipation of a lease of up to 30 years being negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">630 The concession that the three year lease was transitional had to be drawn from Mr O'Rourke in a way which did him no credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">Eventually he accepted that it was nonsense to suggest that the three year lease was seen by NRC and QR as NRC's eventual form of tenure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">However, later in his evidence he sought to return to "the nonsense" that the three year lease was all that NRC wanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">631 This evidence adversely affected Mr O'Rourke's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">I do not consider that he was a dishonest witness but time and again concessions had to be prised from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">He was not an open and forthcoming witness and this is a matter which I will take into account in making findings on the estoppel question and in deciding whether QR was actuated by a proscribed purpose under s 46 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">632 After some prodding, Mr O'Rourke agreed that in the period up to March 1997 he expected that NRC and QR would have reached agreement on the terms of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">This evidence must be taken to have been in the period from early 1996, when the negotiations commenced, to March 1997 when they ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">633 In cross-examination, Mr O'Rourke gave the following evidence on that issue:-
 
 "Because, as you then saw the matter, there was no doubt that however much country had to be covered, two parties --- QR and NRC --- intent on there being a long-term lease at Acacia Ridge terminal, run by railway people, would reach agreement; that was your view in the end, wasn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">--- Yes, we'd reach agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">
 ... 
 And, so far as you were concerned, on the sole condition that QR remained willing to grant a long-term lease, that was your view, wasn't it, that you expected these things to be agreed right up until 20 March 1997; isn't that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">--- Until some time around that time, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">" 
 

634 Mr O'Rourke conceded that in February 1996 QR had no major objection to the grant of a 30 year lease to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">He put forward three reasons for QR's change of position in March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">635 The first was that the exclusive nature of a lease left no flexibility for QR or other operators to access the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">This was referred to as the issue of third party access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">636 Eventually, Mr O'Rourke conceded that the issue of third party access did not affect his willingness to agree to a 30 year lease during 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">This was so even though QR had considered offering competing services on standard gauge track from 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">637 The second reason was the advent of the Hilmer Report and the emerging issue of competition policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">But this was known before March 1997, and in early 1996 when there was no major objection to a long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">So too was the strategic importance of the AR terminal, in the light, inter alia, of a report obtained from Mercer Management Consulting in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">638 The third reason was the announcement in November 1996 that NRC would be privatized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">Mr O'Rourke said that this was the catalyst for the decision not to proceed with a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">639 Mr O'Rourke said, in this regard, that it was the prospect of NRC falling into the hands of "someone we didn't know at Acacia Ridge" which drove the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">It could be in the hands of a "foreigner" or someone from interstate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">640 Moreover, the new owner of NRC may have been a significant competitor of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">Mr O'Rourke eventually conceded this in the following passage of cross-examination:-
 
 "It was a misleading answer you most recently gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">The earlier long answer that I read was, in fact, an honest revelation of why you reneged: You didn't want a new owner of NRC to be a significant competitor of QR; is that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">That's what you swore earlier?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">" 
 

641 His evidence on this issue was usefully summed up in the following exchange, although not without some previous skirmishing:-
 
 "Does it not follow from what you have told his Honour over the last hour or so that in late 1996/early 1997 you came to the decision that there was such a high prospect of QR wanting to compete south on standard gauge in rail freight that it should avoid the disadvantage of not controlling Acacia Ridge and deprive its competitor NRC of the advantage of controlling the Acacia Ridge terminal, and thus that you should withdraw the offer of the long-term lease?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">" 
 

642 Prior to March 1997, Mr O'Rourke had given instructions to negotiate for a long term lease because he understood this was Queensland Government policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">He accepted that the negotiations for a long lease which commenced in early 1996 went forward because that was the policy of the Queensland Government, through Mr Hamill as the responsible Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">In fact, Mr Hamill ceased to be Queensland Minister for Transport in February 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">643 In the course of his evidence on QR's change of position, Mr O'Rourke was at pains to say that a long term access agreement would not disadvantage NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">This was because of his insistence that QR would operate the AR terminal as a multi-user terminal, not a common user terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">644 Common user and multi-user terminals both provide for the operation of a terminal in a way which permits more than one train operator to access the terminal for the purpose of loading and unloading trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">The distinction between common user and multi-user is that, under the latter, access is upon such terms as may be negotiated with the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">Common user provides for such access as may be made available pursuant to rights granted by law, eg under the Competition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">645 Mr O'Rourke's evidence about the desire for a multi-user terminal, operated by QR, was contrasted with his concession that underlying the regime proposed in the reforms recommended by the NFI and the Task Force was that NRC would have terminal control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">646 He was cross-examined closely about the views expressed in the strategy papers and memoranda written by QR middle management, including Mr George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">647 Mr O'Rourke did not appear to recollect those documents but he accepted that QR considered control of the AR terminal to be a "bargaining chip" in negotiations with other entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">648 Mr O'Rourke also accepted that the concept of a bargaining chip was another reason for refusing NRC a long-term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">He conceded that his views about a multi-user terminal were at odds with those of the Queensland Transport, which at that time wished to see the AR terminal conducted on a common user basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">Mr Hearsch's evidence 
 
649 Mr Hearsch was employed by QR, and previously by Queensland Railways and the Commissioner for Railways, from 3 January 1991 to 1 May 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">His position throughout that period was Group General Manager-Freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">He was responsible for the operation and marketing of the freight business, and managing the assets of that business as it was conducted by QR and its predecessors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">The assets for which he was responsible up to 5 May 1993 included the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">He reported directly to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">650 Mr Hearsch read the Task Force Report and considered that it made sense, if NRC was to be viable, for it to be vertically integrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">Thus it would run trains, manage the terminals and control the tracks on which the trains ran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">651 From at least October 1991, Mr Hearsch knew that the parties to the EA had agreed that NRC would have access to the assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">And he knew this access was to be provided for so long as NRC continued to conduct national interstate rail freight operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">652 Mr Hearsch also knew, from at least October 1991, that the Queensland Government's support for the establishment of NRC meant that QR would provide access to the physical assets required to run the network including the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">653 From at least April 1992, Mr Hearsch understood that NRC would take over the management of all interstate intermodal terminals around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">He was aware by November 1992 of NRC's plans for development of the AR terminal and that the costs involved would be in the vicinity of $10 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">654 Mr Hearsch did not have direct involvement in the negotiation of the terms under which NRC went into possession of the AR terminal on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">But he believed that NRC would be in possession for the long term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1517">He did not expect that QR would remove NRC at the end of the three year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">655 In September 1994, Mr Hearsch was opposed to the grant of a 30 year standard gauge track access agreement to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">He communicated this view to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">656 He was not directly involved in the negotiations for a long term lease of the AR terminal in 1996, but he was aware of the issues on which there was disagreement between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">657 Mr Hearsch was strongly of the view that the letter of 27 March 1997 should be sent and he discussed his view with Mr O'Rourke before the change of position letter was dispatched.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">He said that he advised Mr O'Rourke of a number of reasons for the change of position based on his belief that "the fundamental rules of the game" had changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">658 Mr Hearsch's reasons reflected those given by Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">In cross-examination he conceded that one consideration was that NRC under new non-government ownership would constitute a hostile competitor to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">His denial that the reason why QR wanted to take back control of the AR terminal was to prevent effective control passing into interstate or foreign hands was at odds with the information paper he signed on 31 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">659 Although Mr Hearsch conceded that one of QR's key objectives in early 1998 was to maximize the potential for its narrow gauge and standard gauge business, he said there were wider considerations involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">660 He pointed in particular to QR's desire to increase the entire railway market share of business on the rail corridor passing through AR, not just QR's share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">He said that this was unlikely to be achieved under an exclusive lease to NRC and he referred to the difficulties encountered by other operators in obtaining access to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">661 Mr Hearsch said that in coming to the view that NRC should not have a long term lease he had no intention to harm NRC or to "fundamentally undermine" its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">He denied that he had any intention to prevent or restrict NRC in its freight business, or that NRC would be excluded from the AR terminal.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1532">ESTOPPEL 
 The Relevant Principles of Estoppel 
 
662 In the Verwayen at 409, Mason CJ described estoppel as a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">I do not need to set out all of the rules because PN confined its case to three categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">In doing so, PN recognised that the question of whether there is a "single overarching doctrine" or "a general doctrine of estoppel by conduct" was left open by the High Court in Giumelli v Giumelli [1999] HCA 10 ; (1999) 196 CLR 101 (" Giumelli ") at [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">663 The three categories for which PN contended were conventional estoppel, proprietary estoppel, and according to PN's written submissions:-
 
 "an estoppel in pais in the nature of an equitable estoppel, arising by virtue of encouragement, inducement, acquiescence and failure to disabuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">" 


 
664 PN relied on the words of Mason and Deane JJ in Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406 (" Legione ") at 430 to support the formulation of the third category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">In the passage to which PN referred, their Honours said that estoppel in pais includes common law estoppel comprising conventional estoppel and estoppel by representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">They also said that it includes "the overlapping equitable doctrines of proprietary estoppel and estoppel by acquiescence or encouragement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1539">665 The last mentioned words appear to be a reference to the form of estoppel stated in Ramsden v Dyson [1866] 1 LRHL 129 (" Ramsden v Dyson ") at 170.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1540">That is to say, it refers to an equitable estoppel arising from an expectation created or encouraged by the words or conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1541">This form of estoppel includes failure to disabuse a party where the person estopped has knowledge of the other party's intention to act upon the expectation: see Crabb v Arun District Council [1976] 1 Ch 179 (" Crabb") per Lord Denning MR at 189.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1542">666 It follows from the description of estoppel in pais in Legione at 430 and from the three categories propounded by PN, that each of the categories put forward is a species of estoppel in pais.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1543">667 Without endeavouring to discuss the many and varying observations that have been made in the cases, I will attempt to state the essential propositions which flow from the cases and which underlie the determination of the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1544">668 I will enumerate the propositions as follows:-
 
 (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 (" Thompson ") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 (" Grundt ") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 --- 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1545">(2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 --- 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1546">(3) Accordingly, the reference to an "unjust" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1547">That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1548">(4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 --- 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1549">(5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the "narrower" and "broader" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1550">The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1551">It is avoidance of the broader or "real detriment" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1552">(6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1553">(7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 --- 416 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1554">(8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] --- [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1555">(9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1556">Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1557">It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1558">(10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 (" Con-Stan ") at 244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1559">(11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 --- 245, has been qualified by later authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1560">The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1561">(12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1562">It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1563">(13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1564">But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 --- 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 --- 500 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1565">(14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 --- 429:- 
 
 "In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1566">" 
 
 (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1567">This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 (" Humphreys ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1568">(16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1569">(17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 --- 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 --- 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 (" Mobil Oil ") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1570">(18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "interest" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1571">(19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 --- 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 --- 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1572">(20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- 
 
 "If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1573">" 
 
 (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 (" Plimmer") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 (" Austotel ") at 604 --- 610.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1574">Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1575">(22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1576">The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 --- 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 --- 610 per Priestley JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1577">(23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 --- 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 --- 621 per Rogers AJA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1578">
 
 
 Contradictory and unclear evidence of the directors defeats the estoppel claim 
 
669 There are two striking deficiencies in the evidence called by PN to support the estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1579">First, neither Mr Graham nor any of the directors gave clear evidence that he or she held the four critical assumptions, which I have set out at [47], in the terms pleaded in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1580">I will refer to the deficiencies in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1581">670 Second, as I have already mentioned, there are inconsistencies between the various assumptions said to have been held by Mr Graham, as managing director, and the board members who were called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1582">It is true that Mr Graham was far more relevantly connected with the day to day dealings with QR in relation to the AR terminal than were Mr Butcher and the other board members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1583">But it was the board which made the ultimate decisions to incur the expenditure on the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy, not Mr Graham: cf Brambles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1584">
 
671 This of course is not a case in which a party seeks to impose liability upon PN for the civil wrongs of its servants or agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1585">In those cases the law is concerned with the search for the "directing mind and will" of the company: Tesco Supermarkets Limited v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153 (" Tesco ") at 170 --- 171.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1586">In Tesco , Lord Reid said that normally the board of directors, the managing director and perhaps other senior officers speak and act as the company; see also per Viscount Dilhorne at 187 and see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitfords Beach Pty Limited [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 at 370.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1587">672 Here the question is whether there has been an unjust departure by one person, that is to say QR, "from an assumption adopted by another [ie NRC]" as the basis for NRC's decision to make the investment decisions to which I have referred: see Thompson at 547.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1588">673 Thus, although as I have said at [62], Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on Mr Graham, it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1589">I do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1590">674 This immediately exposes the difficulty of the different and contradictory assumptions entertained by those directors who gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1591">There were other directors who did not testify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1592">It must be inferred that their evidence would not have assisted: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (" Jones v Dunkel ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1593">675 What emerges is that Mr Graham's assumptions were quite different from those of the other directors and there were differences between the beliefs and assumptions of Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1594">676 Mr Graham and Mr Stanko (and perhaps Mrs Yeoh) were the only directors who were aware that one of the options available to the State of Queensland was the grant of access rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1595">But Mr Graham and Mr Stanko differed in their beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1596">Mr Graham accepted that the State's minimum obligation was to provide access rights, although he believed in effect that the rights would be perpetual, and on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1597">677 Mr Stanko, on the other hand, believed that a long term lease was the most likely option but he recognised that the State of Queensland had a discretion to grant access rights on commercial terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1598">However, access on commercial terms lies in stark contrast to perpetual access on terms which would ensure NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1599">678 Mr Butcher was quite unaware that access was an available option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1600">His expectation that there would be a long term lease is inconsistent with Mr Graham's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1601">Mr Graham did not broach the question of a long term lease until his letter of 9 May 1995 and, even then, only "in principle".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1602">I am prepared to find that at the meeting between the parties in June 1995, Mr O'Rourke said he accepted the principle of a 20 year lease, but any expectation Mr Graham obtained as a result of the meeting was dependent upon the outcome of negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1603">679 Mr Moore-Wilton expected NRC would have long term control of the AR terminal but his evidence was that he did not discuss with either Mr Hamill or Mr O'Rourke the form of the long term arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1604">Nor did he give evidence of any expectation of the form of the arrangements arising from discussions with Mr Graham or at board level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1605">680 Mrs Yeoh's evidence was very general and I have serious doubts as to whether she applied her mind to the possibility that QR had a discretion to confer access rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1606">She understood that NRC had control of the terminal and that the EA provided a mechanism for NRC to obtain the necessary rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1607">However, she was not clear as to what form the arrangements would take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1608">681 It is true that Mrs Yeoh said in cross-examination that she was aware that the State had a discretion to grant access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1609">However, when she was pressed on this topic she appeared to me to resile from any such understanding of the effect of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1610">682 Thus, what I am left with is a set of inconsistent assumptions held by some of the relevant board members and a total absence of evidence to establish that, when approving the relevant items of capital expenditure, NRC held any of the critical assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1611">683 The closest PN came to proving any of the four assumptions was in the evidence of Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1612">I refer in particular to his evidence that the decision to invest was made upon the basis of the State of Queensland's commitment in the EA (later embedded in the NRC Act ) under which he said the minimum to which NRC was entitled was access for as long as it conducted interstate freight and on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1613">This evidence is in similar terms to the second and third of the critical assumptions, though a gloss has been added in the pleaded assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1614">684 The second assumption refers to enabling NRC "to have the greatest prospect of securing its commercial viability".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1615">This would impose less stringent obligations on QR than terms which "ensured" NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1616">685 The third assumption, which apparently builds on the second, speaks of occupancy of the AR terminal and of NRC's control and management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1617">However, Mr Graham accepted that access on terms which ensured NRC's commercial viability, an interpretation of NRC's rights which he drew from the EA, did not necessarily involve NRC being in control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1618">Moreover, the concluding words of the pleaded assumption "or for at least 30 years" are not reflected in Mr Graham's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1619">686 Accordingly, I find that Mr Graham did not hold the third pleaded assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1620">687 The emphasis in Mr Graham's evidence on access, and his recognition that this option was available under the EA, was inconsistent with an assumption that QR would grant a lease as stated in the first assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1621">Insofar as the first assumption speaks of access rather than a lease, it is said to have been assumed that access would be on commercial terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1622">But this begs the question as to what they were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1623">It is plain that the terms were never agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1624">688 Mr O'Rourke's statement to Mr Graham at the meeting in June 1995 that he accepted the principle of a 20 year lease could not have founded an assumption of a perpetual lease in the terms pleaded in the first assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1625">The same comment applies to Mr O'Rourke's concession in cross-examination that the corporate thinking of QR in 1991 was that NRC's eventual tenure would be a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1626">Nor could Mr Butcher's expectation of a long term lease, or Mr Stanko's belief that a long term lease was the most likely option, prove the existence of the first assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1627">689 The fourth pleaded assumption, namely that in 1993 QR transferred control of the AR terminal effectively in perpetuity or for at least 30 years, was apparently based upon Mr Graham's evidence about the handover on 5 April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1628">He said that the nomination of NRC to operate and control the AR terminal occurred without "any sunset provisions" in the mind of either NRC or QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1629">690 But this falls far short of the fourth pleaded assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1630">In any event, it ignores entirely the fact that the handover of management and control referred to in "the functions letter" of 4 April 1993 must be construed in its context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1631">The terms of the handover cannot be divorced from the contractual arrangements for a proposed three year lease recorded in the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1632">691 I do not see how control of the AR terminal could exist independently from the contractual arrangements for possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1633">692 It is true that the functions letter states that NRC would, in accordance with the EA, assume responsibility for the management and operation of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1634">But NRC could not manage or operate the facility without a contractual right to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1635">The EA did not provide such a right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1636">It paved the way for a right of management and control through the grant of ownership or a leasehold interest, or perhaps through access, but that was on commercial terms and conditions to be agreed in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1637">The functions letter did not contain those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1638">It could not, without more, have conferred a right to perpetual management or control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1639">In my opinion, Mr Graham could not have assumed that control was handed over in perpetuity as contemplated by the fourth assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1640">693 It follows that of the four pleaded assumptions, only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1641">But the only evidence to support it was that of Mr Graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1642">In my opinion this does not establish that NRC adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by Dixon J in Thompson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1643">694 In any event, the inconsistent evidence of Mr Graham and the other directors indicates that no clear or unambiguous assumption was held by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1644">Even if Mr Graham's belief was the only state of mind attributable to NRC within the principle stated in Brambles , so that his state of mind was that of NRC, the estoppel claim fails for other reasons stated later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1645">The EA does not support the existence of the pleaded assumptions 
 
695 Assuming I am correct in reaching the conclusion that PN has not proved that the relevant persons held the alleged assumptions, it is unnecessary to examine the extensive documentary record to see whether the documents give rise to an inference that NRC did in fact hold those assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1646">In any event, in my opinion, the documents do not support such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1647">696 Plainly, the critical document is the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1648">It laid down the legal framework agreed between the Commonwealth and the States for the establishment of NRC as a government owned corporation to conduct rail freight operations on a national integrated rail network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1649">697 One of the principles upon which NRC was established was stated in the EA to be that NRC would have access, whether by ownership or other arrangements, to assets including track infrastructure, which must have included terminals such as the AR terminal, necessary to achieve commercial viability: see EA Recital B(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1650">698 The terms of the EA could, if supported by necessary evidence from the relevant minds on behalf of NRC, give rise to a "legitimate expectation" that the State of Queensland and QR would act conformably with the terms of the EA: see, in a different context, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1651">699 However, any evidence given by the directors of NRC as to their expectations based upon reading the EA would have to be tested against the proper and ordinary construction of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1652">This is because of the principle stated in [668-(16)] that the adoption of any assumption by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1653">700 QR submitted that the EA was a political agreement not intended to create legal relations: see eg South Australia v Commonwealth [1962] HCA 10 ; (1962) 108 CLR 130 ("Railways Standardisation Case") at 140, 148, 149, 150 and 153-154.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1654">There is considerable force in this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1655">Mr Hanscomb acknowledged that the EA was a mixture of commercial arrangements and political imperatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1656">However, PN does not seek to enforce the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1657">Rather, PN contends that the EA engendered assumptions founding an estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1658">701 It is unnecessary for me to decide whether a political agreement is capable of providing the foundation for a claim in estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1659">I consider it unlikely to be so capable in the absence of a representation or other conduct which could have been relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1660">But even if the terms of the EA could give rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because PN's evidence of the assumptions said to arise from a reading of the EA rests upon two misconceptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1661">702 First, "access" in cl 5(6)(a) is not to be given a meaning equivalent to "control" or "exclusive possession".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1662">To do so would be to construe "access" as conferring rights equivalent to a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1663">That cannot be correct because cl 5(6)(a) specifically distinguishes between ownership, lease and access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1664">It follows that "access" must import something different from the rights which would flow from a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1665">703 The fundamental right given by a lease is a right of exclusive possession: Radaich v Smith [1959] HCA 45 ; (1959) 101 CLR 209 at 222.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1666">The nature of access contemplated by cl 5(6)(a), in order to distinguish it from a lease, must be a right of non-exclusive possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1667">But what is plain from the clause is that the grant of access is to be on commercial terms and conditions agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1668">The extent of the rights of access would be a matter of construction of those terms, as agreed: Winter Garden Theatre (London) Limited v Millennium Productions Limited [1948] AC 173.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1669">704 This approach to construction of cl 5(6)(a) is supported by other provisions of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1670">The word "access" appears in other parts of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1671">Recital B(a)(ii) speaks of access to assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1672">The term "assets" is defined in cl 1 to mean any real or personal property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1673">This implies access to a wider range of assets than the access referred to in Recital B(a)(v) which is access to the NRC network and terminal facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1674">705 The words of Recital B(a)(ii) are "access by ownership or other appropriate arrangements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1675">This connotes a full range of possibilities which may extend from ownership (that is, an interest in the land) to something in the form of a contractual licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1676">706 The word "access" also appears in cl 5(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1677">Clause 5(5)(a) deals with the grant of NRC's access to an asset, the predominant use of which has not in the past been, and which will not in the future be, for interstate rail freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1678">The nature of the access suggested by this clause is shared or non-exclusive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1679">707 In my view, the word "access" should be construed consistently throughout the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1680">There is nothing to suggest that the nature of the access contemplated by cl 5(6)(a) is different from the meaning of the term elsewhere in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1681">It is non-exclusive access and does not carry with it a right to control, although it would be open to the parties to negotiate a form of access carrying with it some element of control in accordance with the concluding words of cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1682">708 The second misconception is to be found in Mr Graham's evidence that, under the EA, the minimum right to which NRC was entitled was access for so long as NRC conducted national interstate rail freight operations on terms that ensured NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1683">709 This is based upon a misinterpretation of Recital B(a)(ii) which Mr Graham apparently seeks to then read into cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1684">710 Recital B(a)(ii) says nothing of the terms on which NRC is to have access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1685">True, it speaks of commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1686">However, it merely states that NRC is to have access to assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1687">It therefore deals with the type of assets to which NRC is to have access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1688">The commercial terms, as I have already said, are to be agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1689">This is clear from the concluding sentence of cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1690">711 There is nothing in cl 5(6)(a) which provides that the terms are to ensure NRC's commercial viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1691">Indeed, there is nothing in the EA to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1692">It would be extraordinary if there was because it would be tantamount to requiring the State of Queensland to underwrite the commercial existence of NRC's operation of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1693">712 Even if Recital B(a)(ii) has the meaning suggested by Mr Graham's evidence, it would be wrong to construe the recital as over-riding the operative provisions of cl 5(6)(a): Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Limited v Commonwealth [1977] HCA 71 ; (1977) 139 CLR 54 at 73.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1694">713 Mr Graham's evidence of his understanding of the EA, to the extent that it was inconsistent with the proper construction, was not reasonable and could not found an estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1695">714 Clause 5(6)(a) makes it plain that it was for NRC to identify particular assets, as it did in relation to the AR terminal, and that the State of Queensland had a discretion as to the form of property rights to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1696">It could choose between ownership, lease or access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1697">It was then for the parties to negotiate commercial terms and conditions for the grant of those rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1698">The grant of rights could not be complete until the negotiations were completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1699">715 Even if I were to accept that the discretion was exercised so that NRC expected that a particular legal relationship would exist, QR was free to withdraw unless it induced NRC to assume that QR was bound to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1700">716 It is unnecessary for me to decide whether there was ever an exercise of the discretion conferred by cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1701">The evidence of Mr Bredhauer suggests that there was a positive exercise of the discretion in favour of access rather than ownership or leasehold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1702">If there was an exercise of the discretion, it has not been clearly established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1703">I would infer that Queensland Transports's acceptance of QR's decision to give a notice to quit implies a positive exercise of the discretion by 26 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1704">But PN's case was that the rights flowing to it from estoppel took effect before the change of position letter in March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1705">In my opinion, QR has not proved that the discretion was exercised before that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1706">The documentary record before and after the EA does not establish the estoppel claim 
 
717 Mr Butcher and Mr Moore-Wilton spoke in their affidavits of understandings obtained from reports carried out before the execution of the EA, including, in particular, the Task Force Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1707">718 It is true that the Task Force Report proposed that NRC "take over" major capital city interstate terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1708">But it says nothing of the form of property rights to be granted or the terms under which they were to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1709">719 The short answer to the status of documents such as the Task Force Report and the Heads of Government Agreement is that they were superseded by the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1710">In an estoppel case, it is possible to put forward an understanding based on communications which preceded the execution of a written agreement: cf Hoyts' Pty Limited v Spencer [1919] HCA 64 ; (1919) 27 CLR 133; see Waltons at 399 --- 403.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1711">But it seems to me that here any understandings or assumptions based on pre-contractual reports or heads could not be reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1712">720 Queensland Cabinet's decision of 1 July 1991 that the State of Queensland should transfer control of its relevant interstate rail assets to NRC, might have provided the foundation for an assumption that this would be acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1713">However, none of the NRC directors said they relied on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1714">In any event the decision says nothing of the terms on which any transfer was to take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1715">721 What is plain from the documents is that from the time of execution of the EA, QR and NRC were working toward the progressive handover of control of operations at the AR terminal to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1716">Working groups were established by both of the parties and the documents indicate that there was an expectation that a lease would be negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1717">The terms were to be a matter for negotiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1718">There was much to be sorted out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1719">722 Whatever terms NRC and QR may have had in mind up to March 1993, the position changed with Mr Hanscomb's letter to QR of 12 March 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1720">The letter foreshadowed the framework which was subsequently documented in the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1721">723 In particular, Mr Hanscomb's letter stated that NRC proposed, inter alia, a short term lease of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1722">He said that this approach was adopted to enable the "broader issue of asset transfer" to be determined later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1723">There can be no doubt that this proposal was put forward for NRC's benefit to give it the necessary time to seek to persuade the State of Queensland to become a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1724">That would have enabled NRC to obtain a lease of the AR terminal without having to fund rental payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1725">There was nothing sinister about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1726">It was commercial good sense because the EA provided in cl 6(3) for the issue of shares to the value of an interest in the assets transferred whether by way of ownership or long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1727">724 Although the 4 April 1993 Heads do not say so specifically, it is clear that, when those documents were executed, the State of Queensland had not exercised a discretion as to the form of property rights to be granted to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1728">725 It is also plain that even after the 4 April 1993 Heads were executed, QR and the State of Queensland expected that in due course QR and NRC would enter into a 20 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1729">726 This can be seen from Mr O'Rourke's consideration in May 1993 and August 1993 of the advantages and disadvantages of the State of Queensland becoming a shareholder of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1730">Shareholding would have carried with it the loss of revenue from a lease of the AR terminal calculated over a period of 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1731">What QR expected and indeed recommended to the State of Queensland was that the State should not become a shareholder so that QR could obtain the financial benefit of a 20 year lease to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1732">727 NRC's strategy of deferring a request for the grant of a long term lease was implicit in the provisions of the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1733">This was again endorsed by the Board of NRC on 8 July 1994 when it approved Mr Graham's recommendation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1734">728 By October 1994, QR appears to have had misgivings about the grant of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1735">NRC's Board Paper of 26 October 1994 records that QR was only prepared to grant access rights rather than ownership or a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1736">QR's position seems to have been dictated by considerations flowing from the Hilmer Report and the emerging interest of potential third party operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1737">Mr Hearsch referred to this in a memorandum to Mr O'Rourke dated 14 September 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1738">729 QR's change of heart about a long term lease had apparently disappeared by June 1995 when Mr O'Rourke accepted the principle of a 20 year lease in his meeting with Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1739">730 Negotiations for a long lease were introduced by Mr Graham's letter to Mr O'Rourke of 31 January 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1740">The letter makes it plain that Mr Graham did not consider that QR was bound to enter into a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1741">It commenced by acknowledging the provisions of the three year lease (which in fact had not then been executed) which required, in cl 7.5, notification of NRC's intention to seek a further lease after the expiration of the three year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1742">The letter stated NRC's intention to seek a further lease and expressed a preference for a term of 20 years with an option for a further 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1743">NRC's "non-waiver" of its rights under the EA does not detract from the proposition that the parties were embarking upon negotiations for a long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1744">731 No doubt at that time both parties reasonably expected that such a lease would be negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1745">Mr Scheuber expressed QR's position in his letter to Mr O'Rourke of 27 February 1996 stating that there was no "major objection" to such a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1746">732 Negotiations commenced with the delivery by Mrs Fontaine of a draft lease to Mr Jenner on 20 May 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1747">The correspondence between the parties shows that they were proceeding on the ordinary assumption that the parties were not bound until a formal contract had been drawn up and executed, the subject matter of the proposed agreement being a substantial lease of land: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Limited (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 (" Commonwealth Games Case ") at 548, Long v Piper [2001] NSWCA 342 at [48] --- [55], Landsmiths Pty Limited v Hall (1999) 9 BPR 17,057 at [9]; see also Branir Pty Limited v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Limited [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at [365] and the authorities there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1748">733 The correspondence between Mrs Fontaine and Mr Jenner in the period from June 1996 makes it plain that there were substantial issues on which the parties had yet to reach agreement when QR withdrew its offer of a long term lease in the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1749">Mrs Fontaine's confidence expressed in her memorandum of 27 November 1996 that it was realistic to expect agreement by the end of 1996 may not have been misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1750">However, there was nothing in the correspondence which revealed any intimation by QR that it was already bound or that it had lost its freedom to withdraw from the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1751">734 I reject Mr Hanscomb's evidence that in negotiating the three year lease the parties were "in effect" negotiating the terms of the long lease proposed by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1752">That proposition is quite inconsistent with what took place when the parties set about negotiating the long lease in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1753">I am entitled to have regard to this: see Commonwealth Games Case at 547 --- 548.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1754">735 I also reject Mr Walker's submission that clauses in the three year lease "dovetail" with the proposed long lease so as to suggest that the long lease was on the same terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1755">He put that proposition to Mr O'Rourke who accepted that there was "dovetailing", but not the wider proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1756">In my view it is plain that cl 31.2 of the three year lease merely recognised the prospect of a long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1757">The clause cannot have had the effect of binding the State of Queensland to cause QR to enter into a long lease on the terms of the three year lease, or indeed at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1758">The estoppel claim fails because the assumptions are not clear and unequivocal 
 
736 In my summary of the relevant legal principles I referred at [668-(17)] to High Court and Federal Court authority for the proposition that a representation or conduct founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1759">737 The principle may be traced to a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Low v Bouverie [1891] 3 Ch 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1760">Bowen LJ explained it as follows at 106:-
 
 "Now, an estoppel, that is to say, the language upon which the estoppel is founded, must be precise and unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1761">That does not necessarily mean that the language must be such that it cannot possibly be open to different constructions, but that it must be such as will be reasonably understood in a particular sense by the person to whom it is addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1762">" 
 

738 It seems to me to follow that, whatever species of estoppel falls for consideration, the assumption which is said to have been engendered must be clear and unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1763">739 I have drawn attention to the different assumptions held by Mr Graham and the other directors because, at very least, this must negate the requisite elements of clarity and certainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1764">740 This observation is not confined to the evidence adduced in support of the estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1765">In my opinion the four pleaded assumptions, even if supported by evidence in those terms, all lack the necessary clarity and certainty to found an estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1766">741 The first assumption is that QR would grant a lease or access "for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations in Queensland" on a commercial basis, or for at least 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1767">The extent of any such business and the degree of repetition or continuity of the requisite activity are not spelled out: Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 8 and United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1768">Although the period of the lease or access was said to be for 30 years, the terms were to be on a commercial basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1769">That expression cannot have the requisite degree of certainty absent the agreement of the parties as to the content of the terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1770">742 The second assumption is that QR would provide access "in a way which would enable NRC to have the greatest prospect of securing its commercial viability".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1771">This expression is inherently unclear and uncertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1772">743 The third and fourth assumptions suffer from the same vice as the first; namely, that the control was to be for so long as NRC carried on the business of interstate rail freight in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1773">The alternative term of the period of control, namely "at least 30 years" would of itself have provided certainty, but it is at odds with the potentially indefinite duration of "for so long as NRC carries on the business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1774">The estoppel claim fails because QR took no part in occasioning any of the assumptions 
 
744 As Dixon J said in Thompson at 547, whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1775">745 Even if the assumptions propounded by PN are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because QR did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1776">746 Mr Graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1777">He did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by Mr O'Rourke or, to the extent that Mr Hamill's conduct is, or may, be relevant, any positive statement or conduct of Mr Hamill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1778">Instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from 1992 to March 1997 was inconsistent with Mr Graham's understanding of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1779">747 Failure to disabuse may, in some circumstances, create or encourage an expectation: Crabb at 188 --- 189.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1780">But this head of equity usually depends upon proof that the owner of the property seeks to take unconscionable advantage of another by allowing the other to spend money on the property in the belief, known to the owner, that the person expending the money will enjoy a benefit over the property: Holiday Inns Inc v Broadhead [1974] 232 EG 951 (" Holiday Inns ") discussed by Priestley JA in Austotel at 607 --- 608 and 610.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1781">748 There is nothing in the evidence in the present case to suggest that QR knew that NRC was expending money on or in relation to the AR terminal in the belief that NRC would obtain what, according to the pleaded assumptions, would have amounted to a perpetual lease on terms that guaranteed the ongoing commercial existence of NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1782">749 In short, there was nothing that required QR to disabuse Mr Graham, or the other NRC directors, of any misconception they might have had about the effect of the terms of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1783">750 To the extent that there were any communications with Mr Graham or Mr Butcher about the offer of a lease, they could not have engendered an expectation in the terms set out in the first pleaded assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1784">751 Mr Butcher gave evidence of discussions with Mr Hamill and Mr O'Rourke which post-dated the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1785">Mr Hamill's statement, though made on behalf of the State of Queensland, was capable of engendering an expectation as to how QR would act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1786">But a statement that there would be a long term lease was too uncertain to establish any expectation of perpetuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1787">Nothing was said about the terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1788">It must be construed as preparedness to enter into a lease on terms to be agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1789">752 Mr Butcher's evidence that Mr O'Rourke was "fully supportive of NRC and its assumption of control of the NRC terminal" is even more vague.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1790">753 Mr O'Rourke's statement at the meeting in June 1995 that QR accepted the principle of a 20 year lease cannot have occasioned an assumption in the terms put forward by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1791">The claim of conventional estoppel fails because there was no assumption of existing facts and on other grounds 
 

 
754 Conventional estoppel requires an assumed state of existing facts or an assumed state of law or of mixed fact (ie existing facts) and law: see the authorities referred to at [668 ---(10) and (11)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1792">755 I said at [690] --- [692] that PN has failed to establish that control of the AR terminal was transferred on the basis that the transfer would be effective for so long as NRC carried on interstate freight business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1793">756 I have come to this view because on 4 April 1993, the parties entered into written agreements which provided, inter alia, for them to enter into an agreement for lease of the AR terminal for a term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1794">The transfer of control under the functions letter could not have existed independently of the terms of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1795">757 Where the parties have entered into a written agreement, the Court will ordinarily hold them to the rights and obligations they have assumed under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1796">The law allows for exceptions but they must be proved according to established legal categories: Equuscorp Pty Limited v Glengallan Investments Pty Limited (2004) 218 CLR 472 at [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1797">758 Mr Graham's evidence that there was no "sunset" provision on the transfer of control is at odds with the written agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1798">Substantially greater and more precise evidence would have been required to establish any reasonable argument to the effect that the transfer of control was assumed to be for a longer period than the term of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1799">759 Even if Mr Graham had an assumption that NRC would continue in possession and control of the AR terminal for a period beyond the expiration of the three year lease, that was not an assumption of existing fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1800">760 Mr O'Rourke's evidence was that control was transferred to NRC in April 1993 in anticipation of a lease of 30 years being negotiated between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1801">I have little doubt that Mr Graham held a similar assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1802">But that is not an assumption that control had been transferred under the EA and that this was to continue for so long as NRC conducted national interstate freight operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1803">761 A conventional estoppel must be mutual: see Con-Stan at 244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1804">At most, there was a mutual assumption of Mr Graham and Mr O'Rourke that control had been transferred for three years in anticipation of a lease of up to 30 years being negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1805">That is not an assumption of existing fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1806">If it can found an estoppel at all, it can only be a promissory estoppel: see [668-(13)], which I address below at [771].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1807">The equitable estoppel claim based on encouragement and failure to disclose facts 
 
762 The high water mark of this claim is Mr O'Rourke's concession that control was transferred to NRC on 5 April 1993 in anticipation of a 30 year lease being negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1808">763 The climate of goodwill which then existed between the parties, and the perception amongst all concerned that micro-economic reform of the rail freight industry was to be effected, suggests that Mr Graham and Mr Butcher held a similar assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1809">764 I said at [748] that the claim fails because QR did not know that NRC was spending money in the belief that it would obtain a perpetual lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1810">But the claim based upon anticipation of a 30 year lease also fails to satisfy the necessary elements for an estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1811">765 At its highest, Mr O'Rourke's concession, and my view that Messrs Graham and Butcher held a similar assumption, establishes no more than a belief by all concerned that there would be negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1812">That claim runs headlong into the difficulty raised by the Privy Council in Humphreys and reiterated by Brennan J in Waltons .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1813">A hope or expectation that an agreement will be reached is not enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1814">The party asserting an estoppel must go further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1815">766 The principles are summed up in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 423:-
 
 "Parties who are negotiating a contract may proceed in the expectation that the terms will be agreed and a contract made but, so long as both parties recognize that either party is at liberty to withdraw from the negotiations at any time before the contract is made, it cannot be unconscionable for one party to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1816">Of course, the freedom to withdraw may be fettered or extinguished by agreement but, in the absence of agreement, either party ordinarily retains his freedom to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1817">It is only if a party induces the other party to believe that he, the former party, is already bound and his freedom to withdraw has gone that it could be unconscionable for him subsequently to assert that he is legally free to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1818">" 
 

767 As I understand PN's claim under this head, it is that QR was under a duty to inform NRC that it did not intend to proceed with the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1819">The argument is built upon QR's knowledge that NRC was spending large sums on, or in relation to, the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1820">768 However, I cannot see that this claim has any foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1821">PN fairly and properly conceded that the negotiations for a new lease in 1996 were conducted in good faith by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1822">The position might have been different if QR had not negotiated in good faith because an argument would then have been available that QR had resiled from an assumption which might, at least on one view, have been created by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1823">But that is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1824">The assumption was that QR would negotiate in good faith for a 30 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1825">That was what took place, albeit the parties were still at odds on a number of fundamental issues when QR had a change of heart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1826">769 It was a change of position that QR was entitled to take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1827">As Mr Graham frankly acknowledged, he proceeded on the basis that the State of Queensland had yet to make a choice under cl 5(6)(a) of the EA and it was open to the State to choose access in lieu of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1828">770 The State did not refuse to negotiate entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1829">Acting through QR, it said in Mr O'Rourke's change of position letter of 27 March 1997 that it was prepared to negotiate in good faith to permit NRC to have continued access rights to the AR terminal as envisaged in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1830">771 In their submissions in reply, the applicant observes that QR's submissions on estoppel proceed as if the applicant's case was that QR promised NRC a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1831">The applicant resists such a suggestion; it was correct to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1832">Mr Graham did not point to any promise made to him by Mr O'Rourke, other than his agreement to the principle of a 20 year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1833">Mr Graham was unaware of Mr Hamill's statement made to Mr Butcher in December 1991 that a long term lease would be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1834">772 I have already said that Mr Hamill's statement was too vague to give rise to the claim put forward by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1835">Moreover, Mr Butcher conceded that he took Mr Hamill's statement as no more than a statement of present intention about how the State of Queensland might exercise its discretion in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1836">773 Finally, I will address Mr George's comment on QR's April 2001 briefing paper which I set out at [480].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1837">Mr George questioned whether QR may have encouraged NRC to assume that if it invested capital at the AR terminal it would receive a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1838">The document was not admitted as proof of the fact and it is plain that Mr George was merely raising a question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1839">He referred to a suspicion of "some thinking" in the early days, that is, prior to his arrival on the scene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1840">774 The proposition that there might have been encouragement of the type mentioned by Mr George was not put to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1841">There is nothing in the document which gives rise to a Jones v Dunkel inference by reason of QR's failure to call Mr George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1842">The present case is in no way analogous to the position in Bond Brewing (NSW) Pty Limited v Reffell Party Ice Supplies Pty Limited (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Waddell CJ in Eq, 17 August 1987), where the tenant of a hotel acted upon an assumption that the landlord would not terminate a lease without paying to the tenant a reasonable sum for the value of the goodwill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1843">His Honour found that the landlord knew this to be so, and that detriment was clearly established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1844">None of these elements are demonstrated in these proceedings: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 (" Berbatis ") at [57] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1845">The proprietary estoppel claim is distinguishable from the Plimmer line of cases 
 
775 It may be that under the broader view of estoppel explained by Priestly JA in Austotel it is not necessary that the interest to be secured has been expressly indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1846">I do not need to consider this question although I would observe that the Full Court in Mobil Oil was of the view that it is a necessary element of the principle that the person sought to be estopped has created or encouraged an assumption that "a particular legal relationship" or "an interest" would be granted: see at 513.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1847">776 What distinguishes the present case from the conclusion reached by Priestly JA in Austotel is that his Honour was of the view that the party sought to be estopped was certain to proceed with the lease and had so represented to the party asserting the estoppel: see at 613.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1848">777 Priestley JA was there applying, although distinguishing on the facts, the principle stated by the Privy Council in Humphreys .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1849">His Honour's approach also reflects the principle stated by Brennan J in Waltons which I have set out at [766] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1850">778 In the present case the point had not been reached in the negotiations at which either party intimated to the other that it was unconditionally bound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1851">It is clear from the correspondence with Mrs Fontaine that the parties were still in negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1852">779 The position which had been reached when QR withdrew its offer was recorded in Mrs Fontaine's letter of 30 January 1997 to Mr Jenner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1853">She agreed to most but not all of the 20 pages of draft amendments proposed by Ms Calvisi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1854">Further discussions were to take place in relation to three issues of principle raised by Ms Calvisi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1855">780 There was nothing in the correspondence or in the evidence called by PN at the trial to suggest that there was an intimation by QR to NRC that QR had lost its freedom to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1856">The 1993 Freight Services Agreement does not assist PN's case 
 
781 PN submitted that the entry into the 1993 Freight Services Agreement by NRC and QR involved an assumption by the parties that a transfer of the rights of terminal management had already taken place under cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1857">782 This assumption was said to have been revealed in two ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1858">First, in the terms of cl 5(6)(b) of the EA, in particular in the opening words of that clause:-
 
 "Until all the transfers of ownership, leases or grants of access pursuant to subclause 5(6)(a) are completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1859">" 
 

783 Second, the assumption was said to appear from a number of clauses of the 1993 Freight Services Agreement, in particular, cl 1.2(s), 1.1(w), 2.1, 2.2 and 4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1860">784 I reject this submission for three reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1861">First, it is based on a misreading of cl 5(6)(a) and 5(6)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1862">The submission turns on the proposition that cl 5(6)(a) carried with it a right of exclusive control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1863">785 It did not carry such a right because, as I have already said, a distinction is to be drawn between the concepts of "lease" and "access".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1864">786 Second, the opening words of cl 5(6)(b) did not carry with them the necessary pre-condition that the State must already have exercised its discretion as to the form of property rights to be granted under cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1865">All that cl 5(6)(b) dealt with was the contractual situation which was to apply until ownership was transferred or a lease or access rights were granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1866">There may, or may not, have been the exercise of a discretion by the State under cl 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1867">787 Third, the clauses of the 1993 Freight Services Agreement relied upon by PN do not reveal the assumption contended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1868">It is true that cl 2.1 and 2.2 provide for NRC to progressively assume responsibility for interstate rail freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1869">But that cannot carry with it an assumption that management or control of the AR terminal had been transferred, let alone in perpetuity or for a period of 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1870">Whether QR's silence induced NRC to believe that QR had procured a long term lease 
 
788 At the heart of PN's case was the proposition that QR was aware that NRC was spending substantial amounts of money on the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy, yet it stood by and said nothing to suggest that it would not grant a long term lease until 27 March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1871">789 It is plain that QR was aware from at least September 1993 that NRC was proposing to spend substantial amounts of money on upgrading the AR terminal as part of a program of investment in relation to operations on the east coast corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1872">This appears from a number of contemporaneous records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1873">790 On 13 September 1993, Mr Butcher wrote to Mr Hamill stating, inter alia, that Mr Hamill was aware of NRC's substantial program of investment to upgrade the terminal to complement the investment being made on rail infrastructure on the Sydney-Brisbane corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1874">It is true that this letter was not sent to QR but other correspondence leads to the inescapable inference that Mr O'Rourke was aware of NRC's plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1875">791 In particular, there was correspondence dated 7 September 1993, 23 September 1993 and 4 November 1993 which shows that Mr O'Rourke was aware of the planned expenditure to upgrade the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1876">792 Moreover, NRC's Board Paper of 26 October 1994 reporting on negotiations between Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb with Mr O'Rourke and others, suggests that NRC communicated to QR the level of its existing investment on the AR terminal in an amount in excess of $10 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1877">793 Furthermore, Mr Graham's letter of 9 May 1995 makes reference to NRC's major locomotive acquisition program requiring commercial debt to support the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1878">794 In my view it was perfectly plain to QR that these were not short term investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1879">However, it is quite another thing to say that QR's silence gave rise to a promise of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1880">Nor could silence by QR give rise to an expectation by NRC that QR had agreed or would agree to a lease effectively in perpetuity or even for 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1881">795 At most, QR's silence in the face of its knowledge of the proposed investments, gave rise to an expectation that there would be negotiations for a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1882">For reasons which I have already given I do not consider that this gave rise to any of the species of estoppel contended for by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1883">No reliance on pleaded assumptions 
 
796 Since I am satisfied that NRC did not hold any of the pleaded assumptions I do not need to consider the issue of reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1884">If NRC did not hold the assumptions it could not have relied on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1885">Nevertheless, I will deal briefly with some of the arguments which were addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1886">797 Evidence of reliance was given by Mr Graham and Mr Butcher as well as by the other directors who were called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1887">There was also evidence relevant to the issue of reliance from Mr Hanscomb and Mr Fullerton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1888">798 Mr Graham said in his evidence in chief that if he had received QR's letter of 27 March 1997 prior to making recommendations for expenditure on the AR terminal or the East Coast Strategy, he would not have recommended that the expenditure be made, at least until the issue of QR's change of position had been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1889">799 Mr Graham conceded in cross-examination that there were time pressures to implement the terminal improvements needed to implement the micro-economic reforms contemplated by the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1890">He explained that this involved the operation of longer trains to reduce costs and increase efficiency which required, inter alia, the construction of Track A at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1891">800 QR submitted that in light of the urgency and in light of what was said to be a concession by Mr Graham, I should find that "NRC would have had to spend the money in any event".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1892">QR referred to Mr Graham's evidence that if NRC was using the AR terminal "and if we wanted to adapt it to NRC's operations, we would have had to spend money".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1893">801 In my view, this was not a concession by Mr Graham that he would have recommended expenditure on the AR terminal regardless of any views he held about NRC's security of tenure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1894">802 The whole thrust of Mr Graham's evidence was that the decision to invest was based on rights he believed to be embodied in the EA and in the NRC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1895">He believed that those instruments gave NRC long term security of tenure, albeit that the minimum content of it was not necessarily by way of leasehold but by means of access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1896">803 It would be commercially na&iuml;ve to suggest that Mr Graham would have gone ahead without some such belief or, at very least, a confident expectation that long term security of tenure would flow from the commitments made in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1897">Mr Graham impressed me as an experienced and competent chief executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1898">I do not consider that he would have gone ahead on any other basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1899">804 The difficulty, however, for NRC is that Mr Graham's expectations are not supported by the express terms of the EA or, at very least, they were dependent upon the outcome of further negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1900">Given that there was a strong climate in favour of micro-economic reform and governmental support for the concept of NRC, Mr Graham's confidence was not misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1901">But that is quite different from reliance upon the assumptions put forward by PN as the foundation for the estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1902">805 The same may be said of Mr Graham's evidence about the investment in the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1903">It is true that Mr Graham conceded that there were risks attached to the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1904">The risks were identified in the Board Paper of Mr Graham and Mr Hanscomb dated 6 December 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1905">Mr Graham conceded that the effect of his recommendation to the Board was that NRC either pursue the East Coast Strategy or get out of the business on the east coast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1906">806 It is also true that Mr Graham conceded that he would have considered the investment in the East Coast Strategy even if another party was operating the AR terminal, at least if those operations were consistent with "the long-term viability" of NRC's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1907">807 But these concessions must be viewed against Mr Graham's evidence of his assumptions about the effect of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1908">I do not consider that he would have recommended the investment come what may.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1909">I have taken into account the fact that further investments were made even after the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1910">The explanation for this seems to be that they were part of a strategy which had already been adopted and put in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1911">In any event, there was a belief, which seems to have been supported by the contemporaneous correspondence, that some suitable arrangement would be arrived at, albeit not necessarily in the form of a leasehold tenure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1912">808 I do not propose to set out the evidence of reliance given by Mr Butcher and the other directors or such concessions as they made in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1913">Although they approached the issue differently from Mr Graham, in my opinion it would be wrong to proceed on the basis that they would have approved the investments absent a belief about what flowed from the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1914">Of course, as I have been at pains to stress, that is not reliance on the pleaded assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1915">809 I do not consider that the evidence of Mr Hanscomb or Mr Fullerton adds to or alters the views I have reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1916">810 Finally, a striking aspect of the documentary record is the absence of contemporaneous documents which suggest reliance on the EA to give rise to enforceable legal rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1917">This is most notable around the time of the change of position letter and at the time of QR's final statement of its position in its letter of 25 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1918">811 Even before the change of position letter, Mr Graham referred in a Board Paper of 20 January 1997 to the possibility of the EA being abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1919">He said the prospect of terminals being vested in track authorities may cost NRC the ability to pursue essential features of its intermodal business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1920">812 This theme was followed up in the Board Paper of 31 March 1997 which said that if NRC was denied long term exclusive access to the AR terminal it would be forced to write off works investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1921">813 Nor was there any protest in NRC's Board minutes of 27 March 1998 which acknowledged receipt of QR's letter of 25 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1922">814 The closest reference to a claim of reliance was in Mr Graham's letter of 15 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1923">He said that the expenditure on the AR terminal was undertaken in good faith on the basis of an agreement with QR that NRC's rights under the EA were to be recognised in a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1924">815 But this was a reference to Mr O'Rourke's agreement to the principle of such a lease in June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1925">That could not have amounted to reliance because the "agreement" was required to be formalised in a written document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1926">816 It seems to me that a consideration of the extensive documentary record suggests that whether or not the EA was a political agreement, QR and NRC proceeded on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1927">The underlying thrust of the documentary record, and indeed of Mr Graham's oral evidence was that there would be a political solution to the impasse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1928">Reliance on legal rights was not an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1929">817 QR submitted that NRC was relying upon a favourable exercise of the discretion conferred by cl 5(6)(a) of the EA as to the form of property rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1930">QR emphasised that this depended upon a commitment to be made by the State of Queensland rather than by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1931">818 I did not find this submission to be attractive, bearing in mind the relationship between the State of Queensland and QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1932">It is true that the State is not a party to the proceedings but Queensland Railways was an agency of the Queensland Government and QR is a government owned corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1933">Nevertheless, in view of the terms of cl 5(6)(a) of the EA, NRC could reasonably have assumed that the State of Queensland would have caused Queensland Railways or QR to give effect to the exercise of its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1934">819 NRC also contended that it relied upon the pleaded assumptions in deciding to integrate the AR terminal into its national network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1935">The same findings apply to this as to the decisions to invest in the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1936">It was not reasonable for NRC to rely on the alleged assumptions 
 
820 Perhaps the most fundamental of the many deficiencies in PN's estoppel claim is that it was simply not reasonable for NRC to rely on any of the alleged assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1937">821 Whatever view any of the directors held of the strength of the commitment of the State of Queensland flowing from cl 5(6)(a) of the EA, the clause stated in plain terms that the transfer or grants of rights would be on such commercial terms and conditions as were agreed between the NRC and the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1938">822 It was crystal clear from this that the parties, that is to say NRC and QR, must have proceeded on the ordinary assumption that the subject matter of the proposed agreement, being a substantial lease of land, or perhaps substantial and complex access rights, the parties were not bound until a formal contract had been executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1939">I referred to the authorities at [732] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1940">823 This approach to the question of whether negotiations between parties gave rise to a tenancy by estoppel was adopted by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Kellow-Falkiner Motors Pty Limited v Nimorakiotakis [2001] ANZ Conv R 230 at 233 --- 234.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1941">824 NRC, as a well resourced, commercially sophisticated rail operator, advised by competent and experienced solicitors, must have know that it could not reasonably rely upon rights under a lease, or rights of access or management or control of the terminal in the absence of a written agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1942">That is precisely what the last sentence of clause 5(6)(a) contemplated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1943">825 The position is effectively captured in the following passage from the judgment of Mance LJ in Baird Textiles Holdings Limited v Marks &amp; Spencer Plc [2001] All ER (D) 352 (Feb) at [94]:-
 
 "As I have already said, the fact that there was never any agreement to reach or even to set out the essential principles which might govern any legally binding long-term relationship indicates that neither party can here objectively be taken to have intended to make any legally binding commitment of a long-term nature, and the law should not be ready to seek to fetter business relationships with its own view of what might represent appropriate business conduct, when parties have not chosen, or have not been willing or able, to do so in any identifiable legal terms themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1944">These considerations, in my judgment, also make it wrong to afford relief based on estoppel, including relief limited to reliance loss, in the present context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1945">" 


 
As Mance LJ observed at [95] --- [96], even if the recognised principles of estoppel are "fertilised" by a broader approach exemplified in cases such as Holiday Inns , those cases are explained on the basis that the parties envisaged that rights already existed or they intended them to be created by contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1946">826 What is important, as Mance LJ noted at [96], is that the question is ultimately one of risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1947">In the present case it is plain in my view that NRC was willing to run the risk of making investments in, and in relation to, the AR terminal without its rights being recorded in an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1948">That appears most clearly in correspondence dated 7 September 1993, 23 September 1993 and 4 November 1993 between Mr O'Rourke and Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1949">In the last mentioned of those letters, Mr Graham indicated a willingness to proceed with expenditure notwithstanding that the terms of the three year lease had not been finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1950">827 The same approach appears in relation to expenditure incurred after June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1951">There was agreement to the principle of a long lease but nothing more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1952">So too in the negotiations that took place between May 1996 and the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1953">The correspondence shows that agreement had not been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1954">828 The dispute resolution provision in cl 7 of the EA does not provide an answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1955">That clause provided for "any dispute or difference whatsoever arising in connection with this agreement" to be first the subject of conciliation between the parties to the dispute and, if not resolved, to be submitted to arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1956">A dispute or difference included a dispute or difference as to:-
 
 "(f) the charges and terms and conditions for access to assets pursuant to ... subclause 5(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1957">" 
 

829 NRC and QR were, of course, not parties to the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1958">But in any event, the submission of a dispute to arbitration under this clause could not resolve the question of whether the rights to be granted were to be lease or access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1959">Nor did it provide a means of settling what the area of the lease or access rights would be or the totality of the terms and conditions of the lease or access rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1960">830 Not surprisingly, NRC did not seek to invoke the dispute resolution clause when it received the change of position letter or thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1961">831 Commercially, the decision to proceed with the expenditure was probably entirely well founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1962">That is not for me to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1963">But even assuming it was, that cannot leave the door open for the assertion of an estoppel where NRC was aware that no legally binding agreement had been entered into, or at least where there was nothing to induce NRC to believe that QR had lost its freedom to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1964">832 Even if the investment decisions were made upon the basis of Mr Graham's understanding of the rights created by the EA, that did not provide a reasonable foundation for reliance on the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1965">His understanding was either incorrect or, at most, based upon an interpretation which constitutes only one available view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1966">He did not put his interpretation to QR prior to NRC making the investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1967">Nor did NRC inform QR that it was only proceeding upon the basis that the EA entitled it to a long term lease or long term control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1968">Detriment: the nature of the detriment claimed by NRC 
 
833 The findings which I have made about the absence of a proper basis for the claim of estoppel make it unnecessary to consider the question of detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1969">However, it is convenient that I make findings about the principal issues which arise under this head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1970">834 NRC contends that it will suffer three categories of detriment if QR is permitted to depart from the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1971">The first category is said to be unrecouped expenditure on the AR terminal and the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1972">The second is said to be the loss of a number of opportunities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1973">As I understood it, only two were pressed by PN in final address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1974">They were the loss of an opportunity to obtain the assistance of the Queensland Government in securing a long term lease and the loss of an opportunity to invoke the dispute resolution processes contained in the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1975">835 The third category, operational detriment, involves the fulfilment of expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1976">It is an aspect of the broader category of detriment referred to in Verwayen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1977">
 The relevant legal principles of detriment 
 
836 Three principles should be added to those which I included in my summary of the relevant legal principles of estoppel at [668-(5) --- (9)]; see also propositions (5) and (6) in Brennan J's summary of the principles of equitable estoppel set out at [668---(14)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1978">837 First, the party asserting an estoppel must prove it would suffer a detriment if the "estopped" party is permitted to resile from the assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1979">This is an essential element of an estoppel claim whether in common law or equity: Grundt at 674.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1980">838 Second, the detriment which is to be established must be of a real or serious nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1981">If the alleged detriment is a lost opportunity, it must be one which is real and not theoretical: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v McDade [2001] FCA 457 ; (2001) 109 FCR 137 at [28] , per Carr, Lindgren and Katz JJ; Nigel Watts Fashion Agencies Pty Limited v GIO General Limited (1994) 8 ANZ Ins Cas 61-235 at 75,644 per Kirby P and at 75,654 per Handley JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1982">839 Third, the principles of equitable estoppel are concerned with satisfaction of the minimum equity necessary to do justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1983">Equitable estoppel is intended to relieve against the detriment suffered and not to make good an expectation: see the Full Court's discussion of the principles stated in Verwayen in Mobil Oil at 516 --- 517.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1984">840 Fourth, once the detriment has ceased or been paid for, there is nothing unconscionable in a party insisting upon the enforcement of its strict legal rights: Verwayen at 501.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1985">The fundamental reason why detriment has not been established 
 
841 This case is to be distinguished from all of the proprietary estoppel, or estoppel by acquiescence, cases because from the time when QR sought to resile from the alleged assumptions, it offered to negotiate to provide access rights in accordance with the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1986">842 In particular, from the time of the offer of the Terminal Services Agreement in Mr Wilson's seventh affidavit, there was a specific offer of terms which in my view cannot be said to be uncommercial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1987">It seems to me that for PN to succeed in establishing the necessary detriment I would have to be satisfied that the terms offered by QR are so unreasonable that they could not possibly satisfy any rights which might be embedded in the broad terms of cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1988">In particular, I would have to be satisfied that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement does not confer upon PN the ability to recoup any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the offer of a long lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1989">843 It must be borne in mind that QR has amended the terms of the proposed Terminal Services Agreement to meet some of the objections raised by PN in cross-examination of Mr Wilson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1990">It is also to be borne in mind that QR has undertaken to keep the offer open until 90 days after the delivery of my judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1991">844 Although it is true that the term or period of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is not for so long as NRC continues to carry on interstate freight operations, I do not think that this is an answer to QR's contention that the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement will overcome any detriment suffered by the withdrawal of the "offer" of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1992">Nor is PN's objection that the extensions of the term be at QR's discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1993">845 What seems to me to be the decisive answer to the estoppel claim put by PN is that under the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement, any detriment alleged by PN will cease for reasons set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1994">That is to say the detriment, if any, will cease or be paid for within the principle stated by McHugh J in Verwayen .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1995">846 Even if PN has not recouped the initial expenditure on the AR Terminal or on the East Coast Strategy, it will have ample opportunity to do so under the Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1996">It should be noted that the proposed Terminal Services Agreement incudes an offer by QR to expand the size of the terminal to add two parcels of land comprising an additional 3.25 hectares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1997">This will enable QR to expand the capacity of the AR terminal so as to accommodate PN's existing profitable level of throughput with some increases as envisaged in the latest draft of the Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1998">It must be borne in mind that NRC has already had more than eight years to recoup any detriment said to have been occasioned by QR's change of position in March 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1999">Reliance detriment: expenditure on the AR Terminal and the East Coast Strategy 
 
847 PN called evidence from its Financial Controller, Mr Gilchrist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2000">His evidence was that between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 2004, NRC had made a net benefit from its operation of the AR terminal of $104 million before tax and depreciation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2001">He agreed that in calculating the net benefit it was appropriate to disregard depreciation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2002">848 Mr Gilchrist also gave evidence that, for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 2004, the net benefit from NRC's national intermodal business, before tax and depreciation, was $410 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2003">849 PN also provided expert evidence from Mr Wayne Lonergan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2004">In his first report Mr Lonergan accepted that Mr Gilchrist's method of calculation was reasonable but he came to the view that between 1 July 1992 and 30 June 2002, NRC national operations incurred an overall loss of $12 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2005">This figure was arrived at after taking depreciation into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2006">However, QR's expert Mr Bryant, took issue with some aspects of Mr Lonergan's methodology including his failure to add back depreciation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2007">850 Mr Gilchrist's concession in cross-examination, which in my opinion was properly made, that depreciation must be excluded from the calculation, left PN clearly exposed to a submission that it had more than fully recouped both categories of expenditure said to found the estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2008">The relevant amounts said to have been expended were $16.6 million on the AR terminal and approximately $401 million on the East Coast Strategy, although the latter amount must be reduced because some of the expenditure was for locomotives not related to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2009">851 But even taking PN's evidence of expenditure on these two categories at its highest, it is plain that Mr Gilchrist's concession constituted a major hurdle, if not the death knell of the estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2010">852 Notwithstanding this, PN filed a third report of Mr Lonergan which stated that Mr Gilchrist's answers to cross-examination did not provide a reliable or accurate basis from which an opinion can be formed as to the detriment or benefit derived by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2011">853 Mr Lonergan pointed to the revenue and expense lines of Mr Gilchrist's calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2012">As to the revenue, Mr Lonergan said that the figures include bulk coal grain and steel carrying operations, none of which, based on his instructions, related to PN having access to or control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2013">As to the calculation of expenses, Mr Lonergan considered that Mr Gilchrist's calculations did not deal appropriately with interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2014">854 Quite apart from the fact that Mr Lonergan's third report adopted a completely different approach and methodology to his previous report, there are a number of serious difficulties with his evidence which cause me to reject it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2015">First, Mr Lonergan did not identify which costs were fixed and which were variable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2016">Second, PN failed to discharge the onus of adducing evidence of all the costs of operations on the East Coast corridor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2017">I could not be satisfied that Mr Lonergan's evidence matched the whole of PN's expenditure with the whole of its revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2018">This criticism is directed at PN rather than Mr Lonergan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2019">PN carried the evidentiary onus on this issue: Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) 213 ALR 249 at [17], [151] --- [155].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2020">855 The evidence of QR's witness, Mr Bryant, is to be preferred, notwithstanding that both experts are well qualified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2021">856 The short answer to Mr Lonergan's attempt to offer a different approach to interest costs is that his first report was based on actual interest costs whereas his third report looked at interest in the nature of opportunity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2022">A calculation of whether expenditure has been recouped is not concerned with lost opportunity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2023">Accordingly, Mr Lonergan's approach to this issue in his third report was irrelevant to the issue at hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2024">857 There are two further reasons why PN has failed to establish reliance detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2025">First, PN continues to own the locomotives and other assets acquired by the expenditure on the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2026">PN has the ability to continue to use those assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2027">858 Second, in its offer of a licence to PN of the AR terminal, QR has offered to compensate PN for the written-down value of the improvements to the AR terminal carried out by NRC during the period of the three year lease and in the periodic tenancy which was in place following upon the expiration of the three year lease: see [563] above and see also the definition of "payout amount" and cl 5.2 of the draft licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2028">Reliance detriment: lost opportunities 
 
859 There is no doubt that Mr Hamill was a strong supporter of the concept of NRC and that he favoured the grant of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2029">Moreover, Mr O'Rourke conceded that he gave instructions in 1996 for negotiations to take place for a long lease because he believed that was Government policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2030">He also conceded, as I have previously noted, that he expected a long term lease would have been negotiated if the negotiation process had continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2031">860 But the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to apply political pressure to the then Queensland Government to obtain what NRC apparently considered to be its rights under the EA must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2032">The opportunity was, at most, theoretical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2033">It cannot be accepted as a real opportunity within the principles stated in the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2034">861 There are a number of reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2035">First, any suggestion that a sitting government would act, or be likely to act, in a particular way based upon expressions of a particular point of view must usually be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2036">Although his Honour was dealing with principles of administrative law, it seems to me that what Gummow J said in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193 at 207 --- 211 applies equally in the present context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2037">A discretion conferred by statute is to be exercised on a proper understanding of what the statute requires and, ordinarily, is not to be confined by a statement or decision which forecloses the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2038">862 It seems to me to follow from this that any suggestion of a lost opportunity to obtain the benefit of Mr Hamill's support cannot be an opportunity which the law would recognise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2039">863 Second, there is nothing to suggest that a long lease would have been negotiated in the available time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2040">It took nearly three years for the parties to agree the final terms of the three year lease that was the subject of the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2041">The good faith negotiations for a new lease which commenced in May 1996 had not culminated in an agreement after about 10 months of negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2042">864 Thus, there is nothing to suggest that, even if Mr Hamill had given QR a direction to enter into a new lease, the terms would have been agreed between the parties within the available time frame or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2043">It was for QR to negotiate commercial terms acceptable to it, as was recognised by cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2044">865 The claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is, to borrow from the words of Starke J in Thompson at 528, at best "wholly speculative and conjectural" and affords "no solid basis" for concluding that NRC acted to its detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2045">866 The same may be said of the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl 7 of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2046">Not only did NRC fail to invoke the clause, but as I have already said, the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2047">Operational Detriment 
 
867 There were three species of operational detriment identified by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2048">The first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the AR terminal given, in particular, by Mr Fullerton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2049">The second was said to be the comparison between PN's existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by QR under the Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2050">This proposition was put to QR's CEO, Mr Scheuber, in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2051">868 Third, in his fourth report Mr Lonergan made a comparison between present operating conditions extending through to 2023 or 2026 and the less favourable conditions which Mr Lonergan assumed would apply under the Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2052">869 I will deal with each of these species of detriment in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2053">870 Mr Fullerton was an argumentative witness who was an advocate in the case for PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2054">I would not accept his evidence unless it was corroborated or supported by objective fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2055">871 Of course, as Mr Scheuber fairly conceded, the loss of operational control would be a "huge" disadvantage to PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2056">That is because loss of operational control would deprive PN of the convenience of flexibility which necessarily follows from exclusive possession and control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2057">It would also, in a general sense, bear upon the synergies flowing from NRC's integrated operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2058">Mr Graham referred to this in the evidence which I summarised at [610].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2059">872 But this generalised approach to the question cannot be determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2060">What was required was a fair and reasonable comparison between the benefits and burdens of the amended Terminal Services Agreement on the one hand and the status quo on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2061">873 Three clauses call for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2062">Clause 3 deals with the term of the amended Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2063">The initial term is for approximately two and a half years, to 5 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2064">Renewal for a period of five years is conditional upon the existence of a Corridor Access Agreement for the full renewal period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2065">Since QR owns the rail track from the border to the AR terminal, it would be under an implied duty to cooperate with PN in the grant of a Corridor Access Agreement: Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Limited v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2066">874 It is true that, under cl 3.2, extensions beyond the Renewal Term are in the discretion of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2067">But there is nothing to suggest that QR would refuse to extend the agreement to PN which would, at least on the existing evidence, be its largest customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2068">Moreover, a refusal may trigger a claim of contravention of s 46 of the Act, although, of course, that would depend upon the factual circumstances at the time of any refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2069">875 PN will lose some flexibility in its ability to handle late trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2070">The wording of cl 6.7(a)(i) of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement is awkward, but in my opinion it imposes a positive obligation upon the Terminal Manager to do what is reasonable in the circumstances to provide services: Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited [1980] HCA 15 ; (1980) 144 CLR 83 (" Transfield ") at 101.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2071">In my view, the alteration to the clause in the draft of 6 July 2005 to replace "reasonable endeavours" with "best endeavours" does not affect the scope or content of the obligation prescribed by the clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2072">876 Clause 7.5 and Schedule 2 of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement make provision for the allocation of capacity to PN for increases in the allocated monthly TEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2073">Schedule 4 lists the allocated monthly TEU which varies according to seasonal use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2074">The total annual allocation is approximately 235,000 TEU, which is equal to PN's throughput for the year ended 30 June 2004, as stated in Mr Lawrence's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2075">However, Mr Lawrence said that he expected throughput of 270,000 to 280,000 TEU for the year ending 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2076">877 Schedule 2 provides for an automatic and permanent increase of 10% in the allocated monthly TEU upon notice to the Rail Operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2077">This would enable PN to come close to the anticipated 2005 throughput.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2078">878 However, expansion beyond the 10% figure is conditional upon the Terminal Manager determining, in its reasonable opinion, whether, having regard to the demands upon the AR terminal, an expansion of its capacity is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2079">If the Rail Operator forms the opinion that it is, PN must effectively underwrite a return on QR's capital improvements of 15% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2080">879 These provisions are complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2081">They limit PN's existing flexibility and bind it to pay for increased capacity once notice is given, even if thereafter the additional capacity is not required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2082">880 Nevertheless, the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement appears to provide for PN to be able to meet, or come close to meeting, its anticipated throughput in the volume handled in the current year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2083">The terms of the EA said nothing about the question of improvements to the AR terminal to meet future increases in the capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2084">In my view, these are matters for commercial negotiations between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2085">They do not occasion any detriment which might be necessary to support an estoppel claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2086">881 In my opinion, a fair and reasonable analysis of the amended Draft Terminal Services Agreement demonstrates that it meets any claim of operational detriment put forward by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2087">In my view the concerns expressed by Mr Fullerton were exaggerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2088">It is true that the automatic 10% increase in monthly TEU does not quite cover PN's throughput for 2005, but both parties have acknowledged that if PN's claim fails there would be further negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2089">I would confidently expect that the difference between the parties on this issue could/can be accommodated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2090">882 Mr Griffin, who was NRC's internal audit manager for a number of years, conceded that the operational concerns which he expressed in his evidence could be alleviated by the terms of the contractual relationship with the terminal operator and a spirit of cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2091">He also agreed that it would be possible for PN's computer system to interface with that of the terminal operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2092">This meets the complaint made by Mr Graham referred to at [610] and others, of the supposed adverse impact on the computerised efficiencies of an integrated network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2093">883 The evidence of the current General Manager of the AR terminal, Mr Bainbridge, did not establish operational detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2094">He said in his affidavit that an obligation on NRC to cooperate with other users of the AR terminal, which flows from non-exclusive use, is, in concept, "unobjectionable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2095">It is true that all the details of how the cooperation would be achieved may not be spelled out but that is not the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2096">Once the concept of cooperation is conceded, it cannot be accepted that the loss of exclusive control carries with it the operational detriment of which Mr Fullerton complained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2097">884 Moreover, Mr Bainbridge conceded that PN does not have a contingency plan, such as moving to another terminal, if it loses these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2098">Instead, he said that the parties will engage in further negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2099">This is PN's position notwithstanding what are said to be the dire consequences of loss of operational control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2100">In my view, these concessions negate any possible assertion that loss of operational control will occasion the substantial operational detriment of which PN complains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2101">885 Indeed, it has been NRC's stance since the dispute arose in 1997 that no consideration was given to the possible construction of an alternative terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2102">Mr Graham had no real recollection of pursuing such a course: see [608] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2103">886 That the loss of operational control would not have the disastrous consequences pointed to by Mr Fullerton is in my opinion supported by Mr McNamara's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2104">Mr McNamara impressed me as a fair and truthful witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2105">His contemporaneous notes set out the disadvantages to NRC which he believed would follow from loss of operational control but he considered that these issues could be overcome by cooperation between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2106">887 At the heart of the suggestion of operational detriment was said to be a comparison between the price of the QR offer and the costs to PN under the status quo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2107">This was put to Mr Scheuber in cross-examination and accepted by him although he said it was necessary to look at the terms as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2108">888 To make good this proposition it was necessary for NRC to adduce evidence of its own costs on matters such as lifting operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2109">There was evidence in a report from KPMG of 25 May 2004, to which Mr Bainbridge referred, that PN's costs were $57 per TEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2110">QR's offer of $55 per TEU compared favourably with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2111">Mr Bainbridge referred to PN's offer to QR of $44 per TEU, but he did not know PN's present costs of lifting per TEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2112">889 Mr Bainbridge's inability to provide evidence of PN's current lifting costs leads to the inevitable conclusion that PN failed to make good the proposition that QR's offer compares unfavourably with the status quo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2113">890 Furthermore, Mr Lonergan in his fourth report contrasted a rate of $44 per TEU, which he assumed to be PN's current cost of lifting, with the $55 rate proposed by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2114">Mr Lonergan followed this analysis in his comparison of the present operating costs with what he assumed to be the less favourable position under the Draft Terminal Services Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2115">For reasons set out above, this assumption in relation to PN's current lifting costs was not made good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2116">891 Mr Lonergan's fourth report was adversely affected by this, along with other unproved or wrong assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2117">In particular, Mr Lonergan assumed that there would be a range of percentages of lost business as a result of less attractive operating conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2118">These assumptions were not proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2119">The report does not establish operational detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2120">Not unconscionable for QR to depart from assumptions 
 
892 The absence of detriment precludes unconscionability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2121">In any event, the offer of non-exclusive access is within the range of possibilities provided for in cl 5(6)(a) of the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2122">QR offered to negotiate for long term access when it sent the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2123">It maintains a willingness to ensure efficient management of the AR terminal and a desire to maximise rail freight at the expense of road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2124">Whether it will be able to achieve its aims is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2125">I am not able to say that it will not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2126">It is sufficient to say that, in my view, it is bona fide in its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2127">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2128">THE MISLEADING CONDUCT CLAIM 
 
893 This can be dealt with shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2129">The failure of the estoppel claim carries with it the dismissal of the claim under s 52 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2130">However, there were some nuances in the s 52 claim which I should address briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2131">894 The s 52 claim was pleaded in [83] of the 4 th Further Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2132">It stated that in the circumstances which prevailed at the time of the establishment of QR on 1 July 1995, and in the light of subsequent circumstances pleaded in various paragraphs of the statement of claim, there was:-
 
 "... an implied representation on the part of the Respondent to the Applicant at all times on and after 1 July 1995 and before 27 March 1997 that the Respondent would act in good faith and take all steps necessary or expedient to permit the Applicant to occupy the Acacia Ridge Terminal in consideration for the payment by the Applicant to the Respondent of a fair market rent for the premises and on other reasonable commercial terms, and to permit the Applicant to exercise unfettered control of the management and operation relating to interstate rail freight operations at the Acacia Ridge Terminal, for so long as the Applicant carried on the business of interstate rail freight operations into Queensland on a commercial basis or alternatively for a period of at least 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2133">" 
 

895 Whether conduct amounts to a representation is a question of fact to be determined against the background of all the surrounding circumstances: Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Limited (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 202; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [100] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2134">The conduct must be considered as a whole: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at [39] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2135">896 Quite apart from the extraordinarily wide and open ended nature of the alleged representation, two considerations seem to me to be decisive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2136">First, QR's conduct in the period from 1 July 1995 is to be assessed against the background of Mr Graham's letter of 9 May 1995 and the meeting of June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2137">Mr Graham's letter proceeded on the basis that there was to be a meeting to discuss, in principle, replacement for the short term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2138">Mr O'Rourke agreed to the principle of a long term lease at the ensuing meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2139">How an agreement to the principle of such a lease gave rise to an implied representation by QR that it would take all necessary steps to cede unfettered control of the AR terminal for a period which may have continued in perpetuity was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2140">897 There was nothing in the negotiations which took place in the period from May 1996 to March 1997 to suggest a representation in the terms pleaded in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2141">All that was demonstrated by the evidence during that period was that they may or may not agree on the final terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2142">The agreement by the parties to excise the marshalling yards from the lease indicates this and it demonstrates that the conduct is inconsistent with the representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2143">898 I referred to the agreement to excise the marshalling yards at [316].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2144">NRC received payment of $1.5 million for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2145">Its contention that there was a representation of perpetual control of the whole of the AR terminal is totally inconsistent with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2146">The representation is said to have been in respect of the whole of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2147">899 Nor was there any evidence from any director of NRC to found a representation in the terms pleaded by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2148">900 Even if the matters referred to in [262] of PN's written submissions are within the pleading, which in my opinion they are not, the matters adverted to do not give rise to an implied representation in the terms alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2149">Twelve factual circumstances were relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2150">I do not propose to repeat them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2151">901 The twelfth of these matters was that QR had reservations from about 1994 as to whether NRC should be granted a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2152">This proposition is supported by the documents I referred to at [248] --- [252].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2153">But these reservations were abandoned when QR embarked upon the good faith negotiations for a long lease in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2154">PN's concession that the negotiations were held in good faith is a complete answer to the proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2155">The other matters have been dealt with sufficiently in what I have already said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2156">902 It follows that there cannot be said to have been reliance or any causal link between the alleged representation and the expenditure on the AR terminal or the East Coast Strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2157">It should also be noted that much of the expenditure on the AR terminal had been incurred before 1 July 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2158">903 It is unnecessary to consider the claim for relief under s 87 which is dependent upon a finding of contravention of s 52 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2159">I should add that the claim for damages under s 82 was barred by s 82(2), the proceedings having been commenced more than six years after the cause of action is said to have accrued with the change of position letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2160">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2161">THE UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT CLAIM 
 The Legislation 
 
904 PN claimed that QR engaged in certain conduct, defined in the statement of claim as "the relevant conduct", in contravention of ss 51AA or 51AC of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2162">
 
905 Section 51AA of the Act provides that a corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2163">906 Section 51AC provides that a corporation must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person or corporation (other than a listed public company), or the acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from such a person or corporation, engage in conduct that is in all the circumstances "unconscionable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2164">907 Without limiting the matters to which the Court may have regard in determining whether the corporation has contravened the stipulated prohibition, the Court may have regard to a series of factors listed in s 51AC(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2165">908 Section 51AC(5) provides that a person is not to be taken to engage in unconscionable conduct by reason only of the commencement of legal proceedings in relation to the supply or possible supply or acquisition of the goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2166">909 Sections 51AC(9) and (10) limit the application of the section to the supply or acquisition of goods or services at a price which does not exceed $3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2167">The conduct claimed to be unconscionable 
 
910 The relevant conduct, that is, the conduct claimed to be unconscionable, is defined in [110] of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2168">It comprises:-
 
 &#8226; the letters of 27 March 1997 and 25 March 1998 refusing to enter into a long term lease;
 &#8226; allowing NRC to remain in possession of the AR terminal as a periodic tenant holding over under the expired three year lease from 1998 to May 2003;
 &#8226; giving the notice to quit on 26 May 2003; and
 &#8226; pursuing the cross-claim for possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2169">

911 I do not see how QR's conduct in allowing NRC to remain in possession of the AR terminal for a period of five years or the pursuit of a cross-claim could amount to unconscionable conduct under s 51AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2170">912 Nor could those acts be unconscionable under s 51AC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2171">In addition, s 51AC provides that the Court may not have regard to conduct engaged in before the section commenced, although it may have regard to circumstances existing before the date of commencement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2172">The section came into operation on 1 July 1998 when the Trade Practices (Fair Trading) Act 1998 (Cth) was proclaimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2173">Accordingly, the letters of 27 March 1997 and 25 March 1998 could not amount to unconscionable conduct under s 51AC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2174">913 It follows that the only pleaded conduct to which s 51AA could apply is the refusal to enter into a long lease as stated in the letters of 27 March 1997 and 25 March 1998 and the notice to quit given on 26 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2175">The only pleaded conduct to which s 51AC could apply is the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2176">The relevant legal principles of unconscionable conduct 
 
914 Although there was some difference of opinion between the justices of the High Court in Berbatis as to the reach or breadth of s 51AA, it clearly involves taking improper advantage of a person at a disadvantage in circumstances where equity would intervene: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 200 ALR 491 (" 4WD Systems ") at [180] per Selway J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2177">915 In my opinion the effect of what was said in Berbatis by Gleeson CJ at [7] --- [14], and by Gummow and Hayne JJ at [55] --- [58], is that two criteria must be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2178">The first is that the plaintiff was in a position of special disadvantage, whether by reason of illness, ignorance, inexperience, impaired facilities, financial need or other circumstances affecting its ability to conserve its own interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2179">916 The second criterion is that the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's disability or special disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2180">917 Their Honours made it clear in the passages to which I have referred that a person is not in a position of special disadvantage simply by reason of inequality of bargaining power: see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Samton Holdings Pty Limited [2002] FCA 62 ; (2002) 117 FCR 301 (" Samton" ) at [50] per Gray, French and Stone JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2181">918 The ambit of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA; it is not limited to equitable doctrines or common law principles of unconscionability: see Berbatis at first instance, [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 per French J at [24], and 4WD Systems at [183].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2182">919 The categories of unconscionable conduct may not be closed but the authorities give some guidance as to the type of conduct which must be demonstrated so as to fall within the "unconscionable" label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2183">What is required is "serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2184">The term "unconscionable" imports "a pejorative moral judgment": Hurley v McDonald's Australia Limited (2000) ATPR 41-741 (" Hurley ") at [22] per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Oceana Commercial Pty Limited [2003] FCA 1516 at [336] per Kiefel J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2185">920 In order to establish that conduct is unconscionable under s 51AC, it is necessary to do more than show that the conduct contravenes s 52 of the Act or is otherwise in breach of the provisions of that legislation: 4WD Systems at [185].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2186">921 Morally unacceptable conduct in the form of unreasonable, unfair, bullying and thuggish behaviour amounts to unconscionable conduct within s 51AC: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Simply No-Knead (Franchising) Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 (" No-Knead ") at [51] per Sundberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2187">His Honour said that a refusal to supply or to negotiate constituted unconscionable conduct where the refusal amounted to intimidation or the application of illegitimate pressure on the other party to do something which the party applying the pressure had no entitlement to have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2188">Section 51AA is non-enlivened 
 
922 Neither of the elements of unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law has been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2189">First, the proposition that NRC was in a position of special disadvantage needs only to be stated to be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2190">NRC was, and remains, a large corporation with a very substantial business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2191">It was, and is, well and capably managed and it had the support of Commonwealth and State Governments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2192">It had access to and relied upon legal advice from prominent and very competent firms of solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2193">Any suggestion that it was incapable of looking after its own interests must be firmly rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2194">923 Similarly, any suggestion that QR unconscientiously took advantage of a disability or special disadvantage of NRC in 1997 and 1998 or in giving the notice to quit to PN in May 2003 cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2195">924 It is true that NRC was, as from 1997, in a weaker bargaining position than QR because it had failed to secure a long term lease when it may well have had the opportunity to do so prior to entering into the 4 April 1993 Heads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2196">But NRC deferred the possibility of realising that opportunity in the hope that the State of Queensland would become a shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2197">This would have been to NRC's commercial advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2198">It cannot, by putting itself in a weaker bargaining position with QR, be heard to complain that QR's refusal to grant a lease and the giving of a notice to quit some five years later amounted to unconscionable conduct in accordance with equitable principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2199">Section 51AC is not attracted 
 
925 As I have said above, the only conduct falling within the definition of "the Relevant Conduct" which is said to attract the operation of s 51AC is the giving of the notice to quit on 26 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2200">926 On that date PN was holding over under the terms of the expired three year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2201">It was a month to month tenant, whose tenancy could be terminated by one month's notice in writing: s 129 Property Law Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2202">Thus, the question which arises is whether, by giving the notice to quit, which it was entitled to do under the law, QR engaged in conduct that was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2203">927 Other than pointing to circumstances which I found do not amount to an estoppel, PN pleads in [135] of the Statement of Claim that the giving of the notice to quit was unconscionable conduct having regard to seven pleaded facts, matters and circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2204">These are apparently said to be relevant to the decision to give the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2205">928 The seven pleaded circumstances are:- 
 
(1) adopting a narrow interpretation of "access" in cl 5(6)(a) of the EA as meaning track access, contrary to NRC's interpretation; 
 
(2) adopting the view that after the privatisation of NRC, none of the parties to the EA would have any further rights or obligations under it; 
 
(3) QR seeking to take advantage of its ownership of the AR terminal by using it as bargaining chip for future efforts to enter the interstate freight market; 
 
(4) misrepresenting to the Queensland Department of Transport that there had been major obstacles on agreeing to the terms of a long term lease of the AR terminal; 
 
(5) QR's appreciation of the fact that it had significant bargaining strength in its dealings with NRC; 
 
(6) purporting to rely upon the need for the AR terminal to be operated as a multi-user facility when, in truth, QR's objectives were said to be furtherance of its interstate freight ambitions; and 
 
(7) failure to engage in any genuine attempt to negotiate QR's assertions that it required long term control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2206">929 The short answer to the claim under s 51AC is that none of the matters raised by PN could amount to unconscionable conduct within the meaning of that term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2207">930 There is nothing to suggest serious misconduct of the type described by the Full Court in Hurley .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2208">There is no suggestion of unreasonable or bullying behaviour or any attempt to apply illegitimate pressure of the kind referred to by Sundberg J in No-Knead .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2209">This is hardly surprising given the identity of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2210">931 Even if QR misrepresented the true position to Queensland Transport, as Selway J said in 4WD Systems at [185], this is not sufficient to constitute unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2211">932 The other matters complained of go to what was said to be QR's attempt to subvert the effect of the EA or to the claim of abuse of market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2212">933 But unmeritorious negotiating positions could not, without more, amount to unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2213">At very least, it was necessary for PN to demonstrate that QR's behaviour was unreasonable in the sense stated in No-Knead and that the conduct was in fact carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2214">Mr Scheuber disavowed any suggestion that unmeritorious behaviour took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2215">I accept his denial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2216">934 I have rejected the claim of abuse of market power in dealing with PN's claim under 
s 46 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2217">The same matters relied upon to support a claim of unconscionable conduct must suffer the same fate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2218">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2219">PN'S CLAIM OF MISUSE OF MARKET POWER 
 Introduction to PN's section 46 claim 
 
935 PN contends that QR's conduct, firstly in its refusal to grant PN a long term lease of the AR terminal and, secondly, in issuing PN with the notice to quit on 26 May 2003, amounts to a taking advantage by QR of its market power in two rail infrastructure markets for the purpose of deterring or preventing PN from engaging in competitive conduct in two downstream linehaul markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2220">936 Rail infrastructure is an input into the delivery of downstream services including rail freight by rail operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2221">PN and QR compete in the downstream markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2222">The gravamen of PN's claim is that the AR terminal is an essential input for the delivery of the services in the downstream market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2223">There is no access agreement or regime in place for the AR terminal, although there is a statutory access undertaking given by QR for access to the rail track that serves one of the downstream markets, that is to say the North Coast Line between the AR terminal and Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2224">937 PN contends that QR's purpose in refusing to grant a lease and in issuing the notice to quit is an exclusionary one within the prescribed purposes stated in ss 46(1)(a) and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2225">PN's expert economist, Mr Ergas, has described the exclusionary market power in issue in these proceedings as the denial of an essential input by QR to one of its rivals, namely PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2226">He states that the exclusionary conduct at issue is an attempt to raise a rival's costs by foreclosing it from access to the AR terminal which he describes as "controlled" by QR as a vertically integrated firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2227">938 In support of its contention of QR's proscribed purpose, PN relies upon a variety of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2228">These include the timing of the change of position letter approximately four months after the announced privatisation of NRC, Mr O'Rourke's concession in cross-examination that he did not want to see the AR terminal in the hands of a hostile competitor, and the large number of strategy papers to which I have already referred in which QR middle and upper management stress the competitive advantages flowing from control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2229">939 Although PN did not plead in its statement of claim that the Draft Terminal Services Agreement, as amended by the offer dated 6 July 2005, constituted an abuse of market power, this issue was debated between the expert economists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2230">Mr Ergas claimed that the offer amounted to a taking advantage of QR's market power because only a firm with substantial market power could make such an offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2231">There was debate about a number of clauses in the draft offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2232">940 QR's expert economist, Mrs Smith, was of the view that the Draft Terminal Services Agreement did not constitute taking advantage of market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2233">The Infrastructure Markets 
 
941 Mr Ergas points to "the distinct functional separation" between rail infrastructure markets and rail linehaul markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2234">He considers that there is a product market for the supply of two categories of rail infrastructure, namely narrow gauge rail infrastructure services and standard gauge rail infrastructure services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2235">These are separate from the downstream markets for the provision of rail linehaul services on narrow gauge and standard gauge tracks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2236">942 Mrs Smith agrees that there are separate rail infrastructure markets for narrow gauge, on the north coast, and standard gauge to the border and beyond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2237">She agrees that the downstream markets for the provision of linehaul services are separate from the infrastructure markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2238">943 The narrow gauge rail infrastructure includes narrow gauge track and associated services for the operation of the track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2239">944 PN defined the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market in its statement of claim as access to the narrow gauge infrastructure comprising the AR terminal and the track on the North Coast Line to Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2240">945 The experts agree that the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market includes rail infrastructure inside narrow gauge freight terminals to the extent that the infrastructure gives access to the North Coast Line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2241">The only difference between them seems to be that Mr Ergas may confine the specified terminals to the AR terminal whereas Mrs Smith would include other terminals in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2242">Mr Ergas makes it clear that he rejects a dual gauge definition as too narrow, and prefers "rail infrastructure markets" including rail freight terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2243">946 There are other terminals in the Brisbane area servicing narrow gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2244">They include the Moolabin terminal, the Brisbane Multi-Modal Terminal ("BMT") located at Fisherman Islands, QR's Q-Link terminal at Acacia Ridge, the Clapham yard, the EA Rocke siding at QR, and a substantial number of private sidings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2245">947 PN contends that the other narrow gauge terminals are inferior to the AR terminal, principally because of their size and location at varying distances from the infrastructure located inside the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2246">However, it is significant that in March 2005, a subsidiary of PN signed an agreement with QR to run PN's narrow gauge operations from the Moolabin terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2247">948 The AR terminal is used for a variety of services other than the transhipment of containers between narrow gauge and standard gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2248">In particular, it is used for the transfer of containers to and from trucks servicing the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2249">949 According to Mr Ergas, in 2003 only about 7% of the containers arriving at the AR terminal by standard gauge were transhipped from narrow to standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2250">Mrs Smith's evidence, though to similar effect, was objected to and treated as an assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2251">Nevertheless, there is no real difference between the experts and the assumption may be taken to have been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2252">950 Mr Ergas is of the view that there is a separate market for the supply of standard gauge rail infrastructure services on the facilities comprised in the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2253">951 Mrs Smith agrees that there is a separate market but she considers that the BMT should be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2254">Mrs Smith suggests that Southern terminals located near Melbourne should also be included but I do not accept that the southern terminals are close substitutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2255">952 The market for the supply of standard gauge infrastructure services is defined in the statement of claim as the Standard Gauge Rail Infrastructure Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2256">It is sometimes called the SG Rail Infrastructure Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2257">It comprises, at least, access to the standard gauge infrastructure located at the AR terminal which gives access to the standard gauge rail track running from Acacia Ridge to the border and beyond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2258">953 In comparison to the AR terminal, the BMT has significant disadvantages because of its inferior location and increased costs of operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2259">Trains arriving or departing from the BMT on standard gauge that require access to the AR terminal have to be shunted across 340 metres of track within the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2260">954 In summary, I accept that there are separate infrastructure markets for access to the infrastructure on the narrow gauge and standard gauge lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2261">955 Mrs Smith proceeded on the assumption that the infrastructure market for access to narrow gauge, that is to say the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market, is not confined to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2262">In her opinion, it includes the other terminals in the Brisbane area to which I referred at [946].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2263">It is to be noted that these terminals include Moolabin, from which PN is now conducting narrow gauge services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2264">956 Much was said by PN about the disadvantages of Moolabin, notwithstanding its own use of that terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2265">But Mr Ergas conceded that Moolabin was an alternative to the AR terminal for operation on the North Coast Line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2266">Mrs Smith's views that Moolabin was an alternative were based on her assumption, which appears to be well placed in spite of PN's protestations to the contrary, that Moolabin is suitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2267">957 It seems to me that Mrs Smith's view is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2268">There was nothing to suggest that the other terminals were not close substitutes for the provision of narrow gauge services, particularly in light of PN's use of Moolabin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2269">As Mrs Smith says, it is not necessary for rivals to use the AR terminal to operate an efficient linehaul service on the narrow gauge line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2270">958 I am, however, prepared to proceed on the basis that the infrastructure market for standard gauge services is confined to access to the AR terminal and to the East Coast line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2271">I am inclined to the view that the unsuitability of the BMT confines the terminals to but one, namely the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2272">959 The infrastructure at the AR terminal, for present purposes, may be said to be:-
 
 &#8226; the points and track infrastructure which at an operational level control access to standard and narrow gauge loading and unloading facilities;
 &#8226; the container terminal area including roads and facilities for loading, unloading and storing containers; and
 &#8226; the marshalling yards used for assembling trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2273">
 The Linehaul Markets 
 
960 The primary customers of rail linehaul services are freight forwarders who provide transport to businesses that generate freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2274">They make significant investment in assets specifically for rail transport, including containers and technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2275">These sunk costs make it harder for them to switch to road in the face of a small but significant price increase in rail freight rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2276">961 Mr Ergas and Mrs Smith agreed that road and rail are not close substitutes from the perspective of freight forwarders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2277">That is not to say that road may not be a threat to rail in the longer term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2278">962 The experts agree that there are two separate downstream markets for the provision of rail linehaul services on narrow and standard gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2279">The existence of the linehaul market described in the statement of claim as the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market, that is for the provision of rail freight services on the North Coast Line, is admitted on the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2280">963 The existence of the linehaul market described as the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market is not admitted on the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2281">The difference between the parties seems to be that QR seeks to include access to the terminal in the standard gauge linehaul market to Sydney and Melbourne rather than as a part of the infrastructure market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2282">964 However, I am entitled to proceed on the basis stated in the points of agreement and disagreement, notwithstanding the debate about its status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2283">In the result, I am of the view that access to the AR terminal is not part of the linehaul market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2284">965 In summary, I find that there are two relevant linehaul markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2285">The first is the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market which is a market for the supply of rail linehaul services on the narrow gauge rail infrastructure between Brisbane and Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2286">966 The second is the market described as the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market which is a market for the supply of rail linehaul services on the standard gauge rail infrastructure on the East Coast of Australia, including the track between Brisbane and the border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2287">Market Power 
 
967 Market power may be defined as the ability of a firm to raise prices above supply costs without rivals taking away customers: see Queensland Wire Industries Pty Limited v Broken Hill Pty Limited [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 (" Queensland Wire" ) at 188 and 200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2288">Market power is not confined to the ability to influence prices; it may be manifested in practices directed at excluding competition, such as exclusive dealing or refusal to supply: Queensland Wire at 200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2289">968 In Melway Publishing Pty Limited v Robert Hicks Pty Limited [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 (" Melway ") at [43] the majority justices observed that the notion of market power as the capacity to act in a manner unconstrained by the conduct of competitors is reflected in s 46(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2290">The absence of constraint from customers is also a relevant matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2291">Matters of degree are involved: Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (" Boral ") at [121] per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2292">969 The circumstances which may give rise to the absence of competitive constraint on a corporation are diverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2293">They are not confined to the matters identified in s 46(3): see Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR 164 (" Pioneer Concrete ") at 172-173 and 176; see also Boral at [168] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2294">970 The primary consideration in determining market power is whether there are barriers to entry into the relevant market: Pioneer Concrete at 173, citing Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty Limited (1992) 35 FCR 43 (" Eastern Express ") at 62-63 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2295">971 A corporation will have a substantial degree of power in the market if it has a considerable or large degree of power: Eastern Express at 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2296">972 In JD Heydon, Trade Practices Law : Restrictive Trade Practices, Deceptive Conduct and Consumer Protection, LBC, Vol 1, Sydney at [5.40], the learned author observes that s 46(1) is not concerned with a firm moving toward possession of a substantial degree of power in a market but only with a firm which has already gained possession of a substantial degree of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2297">This is because abuse of monopoly power consists of a corporation with the requisite degree of power taking advantage of it for a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2298">Unless the power presently exists there is nothing of which it can be said the corporation has taken advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2299">Whether QR has market power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market 
 
973 Both expert economists agreed that access to the AR terminal is necessary for someone to compete effectively on the East Coast Linehaul Market and that whoever controls access to and use of the AR terminal has a substantial degree of power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2300">974 But it does not follow that QR had, at the time of the impugned conduct, a substantial degree of power in the market for providing access to the relevant infrastructure at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2301">This is because QR ceded exclusive possession to NRC on 5 April 1993 and, since that date has been an owner without any right to possession or control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2302">975 NRC went into exclusive possession in 1993, initially under the terms of the 4 April 1993 Heads and thereafter on the terms of the three year lease eventually signed on 26 February 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2303">NRC then held over, with QR's consent under the terms of the expired lease until the notice to quit was issued on 26 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2304">Thereafter PN remained in exclusive possession pursuant to QR's undertaking to the Court given on 13 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2305">976 During the period of PN's exclusive possession QR has itself been unable to obtain access to the AR terminal pursuant to requests made to PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2306">977 In my view it follows that, subject to considering Mr Ergas' views about QR's powers as an owner out of possession, QR cannot be said to have had a substantial degree of power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market at the time of the impugned conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2307">978 The reason for this is quite straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2308">QR owned the relevant infrastructure, but the terms of NRC's occupation, that is to say as a tenant with the right of exclusive possession and control, was inconsistent with the existence of market power residing in QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2309">The market is for the supply of access to the infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2310">QR had no powers in that market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2311">It had no ability to ask, let alone raise, prices for the supply of that service: Queensland Wire at 188 and 200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2312">979 Alternatively, any power arising from QR's ownership of the AR terminal was constrained by the grant of exclusive possession to NRC: Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172-173 and 176.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2313">980 Mr O'Rourke considered that there is a barrier to entry in the infrastructure market because of the cost and logistical difficulties of building an alternative terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2314">But I do not consider that to be decisive in the present case because the question here is whether QR had market power at a time when NRC was in exclusive occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2315">981 The position in the present case is quite different from that which existed in NT Power .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2316">There, the owner of electricity and distribution infrastructure which refused access to a competitor was held to have a substantial degree of power in the market for transmission and distribution of electricity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2317">The owner was held to have taken advantage of its power for a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2318">982 However, by contrast with the present case, the market power of the infrastructure owner in NT Power derived from its ownership and control of the infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2319">The majority justices said at [63] that the critical fact underlying the owner's market power was its control of the infrastructure; see also at [114].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2320">983 Mr Ergas sought to overcome this difficulty in PN's case by arguing that QR had market power by reason of its ability as owner to refuse to grant a lease and to thereby undermine PN's security of tenure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2321">This, he said, could increase PN's costs by reducing its ability to invest in improvements to the AR terminal which would increase PN's costs on the East Coast Line, thereby giving exclusionary market power to QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2322">984 Mr Ergas added to this that if PN does not have secure long term leasing arrangements the effect is to threaten investment security and impede it from operating efficiently, forcing it to have higher costs and, in turn, raising rival's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2323">985 After some debate, Mr Ergas accepted that his argument was based on economic theory or, as he called it, economic analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2324">He was unable to point to any assumption of fact that there was a need for further investment, that rivals' costs had been raised, or that efficiency had been impeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2325">986 In my view Mr Ergas' argument is pure economic theory unsupported by the facts of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2326">987 The two critical time periods are March 1997 to March 1998 when QR refused to grant a long term lease and May 2003 when the notice to quit was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2327">In the first of those periods NRC was under the stewardship of Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2328">He held an assumption that NRC was entitled to a minimum level of security of access in accordance with the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2329">But from at least 25 March 1998, NRC's insecurity of tenure must have been apparent to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2330">Notwithstanding this, Mr Graham gave no evidence that NRC's insecure tenure impeded its efficiency or raised costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2331">988 Nor was any such evidence given by PN's financial controller, Mr Gilchrist, or its General Manager, Intermodal, Mr Bainbridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2332">989 Accordingly, I am entitled to infer that their evidence would not have assisted PN on this issue: Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Limited v Ferrcom Pty Limited (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 ("Ferrcom") at 418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2333">990 Moreover, the effect of the evidence on the question of the capacity of the AR terminal is inconsistent with Mr Ergas' theory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2334">It is clear from the evidence of Mr Lawrence, the AR terminal manager, that PN has been able to extract additional capacity through the adoption of more efficient management practices without the need for additional investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2335">These practices included the 3-stacking of containers in lieu of the previous 2-stacking method, thereby increasing storage space.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2336">991 Mr Lawrence's evidence was that the throughput of the AR terminal for the year ended 30 June 2004 was 230,000 TEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2337">He said he expected the volume to increase to about 280,000 TEU for the year ended 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2338">This illustrates the fact that capacity was not fully utilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2339">992 Mr Lawrence said he was not an expert in judging the maximum capacity of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2340">Nevertheless, it seems to me that the effect of concessions made by him is that there would be some additional capacity available to be extracted over and above 280,000 TEU through further refinements in management practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2341">993 It is clear to me from the evidence of Mr Lawrence and from the evidence of PN's divisional Marketing Manager, Mr Griffin, that PN has conducted its operations at the AR terminal to suit its own interests as the operator of a national freight network without the constraints pointed to in Mr Ergas' theory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2342">994 Mr Griffin said that PN has been able to conduct its operations at the AR terminal in a way that meets its own priorities as a train operator even if this is an inefficient use of the AR terminal as a stand alone facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2343">Mr Lawrence said that he would do whatever was in his power to accommodate PN's trains, and to change his practices to achieve that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2344">995 The only evidence to which PN pointed to support a finding that it was unwilling to make investments in the terminal consisted of two documents which were not admitted as proof of the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2345">The documents were two letters from Mr Mark Smith, Manager Access and Infrastructure of PN to Mr Buckley dated 16 July 2004 and 10 September 2004 and an open offer to settle the proceedings under cover of a letter from PN's solicitors dated 24 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2346">996 The effect of the statements in the documents relied upon by PN was that access to QR could not be given without increasing the capacity of the terminal which PN would not do while its tenure was insecure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2347">These statements go no way to proving the assumptions made by Mr Ergas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2348">997 Mr Ergas' evidence on this topic shows that he was an unsatisfactory witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2349">He was an articulate, if somewhat wordy exponent of economic theory, but he was ultimately an advocate for PN's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2350">998 On the other hand, Mrs Smith seemed to me to be a witness who strove to answer questions fairly without acting as an advocate for QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2351">For the most part, but subject to some exceptions, I would accept her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2352">999 Mrs Smith's evidence was that QR does not possess substantial power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market because PN controls the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2353">I accept her evidence on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2354">1000 This is sufficient to dispose of PN's claim under s 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2355">However, I will briefly address a number of other arguments that were put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2356">1001 QR argued that a distinction is to be drawn between refusal to grant a lease and refusal to grant long term access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2357">It pointed to evidence given by Mrs Smith of the danger of running the two concepts together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2358">1002 It submitted that QR's ability to refuse to grant a lease was independent of any question of power in the market for supplying access to standard gauge trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2359">1003 I reject this submission which rests on a highly artificial distinction between two types of property rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2360">As owner, QR refuses to grant a long term lease to PN and seeks to recover possession, although it has offered long term access to PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2361">Mrs Smith accepted that this is conduct in relation to a market for which the AR terminal is an influential circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2362">1004 QR also submitted that it was not a supplier of the relevant service, namely access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2363">It pointed to the statement in NT Power at [115] that s 46(4)(c) provides that the relevant power is supplier power or acquirer power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2364">It submitted that QR was not a supplier of access, that service being supplied by PN through its existing control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2365">1005 In NT Power at [115] the majority justices were merely identifying "the character or capacity in which the corporation has whatever market power it has".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2366">They distinguished this from other forms of power such as that of a financial institution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2367">1006 This leaves open the possibility that in certain circumstances an owner whose market power derives from its capacity as owner may have "supplier power" in the sense referred to by McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2368">However, in the present case, it seems to me that without any right of possession, and in circumstances in which QR's own requests for access has been refused, it cannot be said that it has the requisite capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2369">1007 A further question arises on the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2370">It is whether QR has market power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market by reason of its control of the track from the AR terminal to the NSW border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2371">However, I accept QR's submission that this is a false issue because there is no complaint that QR has sought to injure NRC as a competitor by denying or restricting its access to the track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2372">1008 Accordingly, I do not need to consider QR's submission that there are various constraints on the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2373">Nevertheless, I would observe that there is considerable force in Mr Ergas' argument that a self imposed constraint is no constraint at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2374">This seems to me to answer QR's submission that the East Coast Line is administered by QR's NAG in the same way as the infrastructure on the North Coast Line which is the subject of a statutory undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2375">I doubt that the NAG is truly ringfenced as contended by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2376">1009 The evidence demonstrates that the NAG has been intimately involved in QR's plans to retake position of the AR terminal; see eg the discussion paper produced by NAG in consultation with C&amp;FS on the subject of "Strategic Options for the Management and Operations of the Acacia Ridge Standard Gauge Yard" to which I referred at [505].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2377">Whether QR has market power in the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market 
 
1010 There are two reasons why QR did not, at the relevant times, have market power in the market for access to narrow gauge infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2378">1011 First, for the reasons given in relation to the SG Rail Infrastructure Market, QR's ownership without any right to possession or control, did not give it any power in the market described as the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2379">1012 Second, I accept Mrs Smith's opinion that even if QR had control of the AR terminal it would not confer exclusionary market power on it because of the constraints arising from the existence of other narrow gauge terminals in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2380">I referred to those terminals at [946].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2381">1013 The evidence establishes that PN has supplied rail linehaul services on the North Coast Line since March 2005, even though it still controlled the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2382">The fact that PN commenced operating narrow gauge rail freight services from Moolabin at a time when it had a choice of operating from the AR terminal suggests that Moolabin is a suitable facility from which to conduct rail linehaul services on the North Coast Line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2383">1014 Mr Ergas eventually conceded that even if QR controlled the AR terminal he could not conclude that this conferred market power on it in the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2384">1015 Mr Ergas' answers to questions put to him about the suitability of Moolabin as an alternative terminal show the lengths to which he was prepared to go to argue PN's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2385">I will set out the relevant portion of the transcript as follows:-
 
 "Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2386">You refer to the fact that PN itself has commenced running its narrow gauge linehaul operation from Moolabin as suggesting that Moolabin may well be a competitive alternative to Acacia Ridge, don't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2387">--- I believe that Moolabin is an alternative, whether it's a close alternative that would provide an equally effective springboard, that is a matter of fact which I don't really have all of the elements to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2388">
 
 No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2389">You have to arrive at the position that on what you know you can't conclude that ownership of Acacia Ridge would give market power in respect of the north coast rail infrastructure market?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2390">--- I believe it would, but I don't have all the elements of fact that would allow me to, in the current situation, demonstrate that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2391">
 
 You can't form that belief, can you, given the concessions you've made about not having sufficient facts?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2392">Once you know that there are other competing terminals, you know that PN itself has commenced its operations from Moolabin rather than Acacia Ridge, before you could conclude that control of the Acacia Ridge would give market power in the north coast rail infrastructure market, you would have to conclude that the control of Acacia Ridge was such that the others were not relatively competing terminals, and you don't have enough information to form that view?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2393">--- I believe that to be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2394">I believe that there are issues in respect of Moolabin, in particular, and I believe that those issues would be material issues going forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2395">
 
 Please answer my question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2396">Unless you had sufficient information about the other terminals to conclude that an owner or controller of Acacia Ridge raising the price there would not lose customers to the other terminals, you could not conclude that control of Acacia Ridge gives market power in the north coast rail infrastructure market?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2397">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2398">
 
 Can we turn, please, to the --- just before we move from the north coast market --- therefore you can't reach a view on the information you have at the moment that QR does have market power in the north coast infrastructure market?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2399">--- That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2400">" 
 

1016 I reject PN's submission that Moolabin is not a suitable terminal from which to operate on the North Coast Line and that it is only a short term expedient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2401">Mr Bainbridge, who is responsible for PN's operations on the North Coast Line, did not address the suitability of the Moolabin terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2402">I am entitled to infer that his evidence would not have assisted PN: Ferrcom at 418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2403">1017 As with the SG Rail Infrastructure Market, the suggestion that QR has market power in the North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market by reason of its ownership of the narrow gauge track is a false issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2404">There is no complaint that QR has denied NRC access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2405">1018 In any event, the narrow gauge track has been declared under Reg 4 of the Queensland Competition Authority Regulations 1997 (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2406">QR has given an access undertaking which has been approved under the Competition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2407">The undertaking constrains QR in negotiating to provide access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2408">The intent of it is to ensure that access is negotiated in a competitively neutral environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2409">NRC has been given access pursuant to the North Coast Access Agreement referred to in [560].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2410">1019 I accept Mrs Smith's evidence that QR is constrained in respect of any market power it would have over the tracks by reason of the declaration and the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2411">1020 Mr Ergas' opinion is that QR has market power by reason of its ownership of the track but that the declaration and the undertaking go to the question of whether it has taken advantage of the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2412">However, that view seems to me to be contrary to the authorities referred to above, in particular Melway at [43], Boral at [121], and Pioneer Concrete at 172 -173 and 176.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2413">Whether QR has taken advantage: SG Rail Infrastructure Market 
 
1021 It is unnecessary for me to answer this because I have come to the view that QR did not have market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2414">Nevertheless, I will deal with this question briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2415">1022 Section 46 requires the co-existence of market power, taking advantage and proscribed purpose: Melway at [44] and Boral at [120].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2416">1023 Whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is often a difficult question to answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2417">This may be because the words "take advantage" have been equated with "use": see Queensland Wire at 191, 194, 202 and 213 --- 214; but the word "use" does not capture the full meaning of "take advantage": Boral at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2418">1024 The following ten principles emerge from Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which have explained the proper approach to construction:-
 
(1) what is involved in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power is the sufficiency of the connection between the market power and the conduct complained of: Melway at [44] and [67]; Boral [120] and [170]; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 (" Rural Press ") at [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2419">McHugh J has said that a causal connection is required: Boral at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2420">(2) if the impugned conduct has a rational business explanation, that is a factor which points against the existence of a relevant connection between the market power and the conduct: Melway at [67]; Boral at [170].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2421">(3) the words "take advantage" do not encompass conduct which has the purpose of protecting market power but no other connection: Rural Press at [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2422">(4) in deciding whether a firm has taken advantage, is it relevant to ask how it would have behaved if it lacked power and whether it could have behaved in the way it did in a competitive market: Melway at [52] and [61]; Rural Press at [52].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2423">(5) it may be proper to conclude that a firm is taking advantage of market power where it does something that is materially facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51]; Rural Press at [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2424">(6) McHugh J has said that the conduct must have given the firm an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2425">(7) the test may be whether the conduct was necessarily an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2426">(8) one of the difficulties in determining what constitutes taking advantage stems from the need to distinguish between monopolistic practices and vigorous competition: Queensland Wire at 202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2427">(9) the purpose of s 46 is the promotion of competition; it is concerned with the protection of competition, not competitors: Queensland Wire at 191 and 194; Boral at [87], [160], [164] and [260]; Melway at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2428">(10) it is dangerous to proceed from a finding of proscribed purpose to a conclusion of the existence of a substantial degree of market power, which can be taken advantage of; to do so will ordinarily be to invert the reasoning process: Boral at [123], [194].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2429">1025 As Heerey and Sackville JJ pointed out in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Safeway Stores Pty Limited (2003) 129 FCR 329 (" Safeway ") at [339], in answering the question of whether a firm has taken advantage of market power it is necessary to look not only at what the firm did but why the firm did it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2430">That is why a business rationale for the conduct, to which I referred in the second principle above, independent of the question of market power, is relevant to determining the sufficiency of the connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2431">That is what lies at the heart of the assessment of whether the firm has taken advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2432">1026 In the present case it is necessary to consider QR's rationale for refusing to grant a long term lease to NRC in 1997 and 1998 and for its service of the notice to quit on PN in May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2433">1027 QR's business rationale for its conduct in 1997 and 1998 was not as fully developed as that which more clearly emerged in documents recording its objectives in giving the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2434">Nevertheless, documents exist which, when read in the light of oral testimony, explain why QR changed its position with respect to the grant of a long term lease to NRC in 1997 and why it maintained that stance in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2435">The documents were not admitted as proof of the facts but, insofar as they state QR's objectives, they must be accepted as containing such statements, unless challenged by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2436">1028 PN accepted that Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch were the witnesses whose evidence was relevant to QR's purposes in its 1997/1998 conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2437">1029 It is to be noted that at the outset, Mr O'Rourke stated in his letter of 27 March 1997 that the AR terminal was of strategic importance and that there was a need for it to be operated as a common user facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2438">1030 Mr Walker attacked this as a false justification in his cross-examination of Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2439">He put to Mr O'Rourke that the issue of third party access was not a major obstacle to the grant of a 30 year lease during 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2440">1031 Mr O'Rourke did not handle this line of cross-examination well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2441">He was troubled by the obvious tension between his insistence on third party access rights as an actuating motive and the proposition that third party access rights would, as a matter of law, equally bind QR as owner or NRC as long term lessee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2442">1032 It is true that Mr O'Rourke eventually conceded that his change of position in early 1997 was driven by the desire to avoid the disadvantage of not controlling the AR terminal and by the wish to deprive its competitor, NRC, of that advantage; see passage at [641].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2443">The timing of the change of position letter, some four months after the Government's announced privatisation of NRC, underscores the truth of that concession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2444">1033 But it would be wrong to proceed on the basis that QR's sole rationale was to deprive NRC of control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2445">Moreover, as I have been at pains to stress, from the outset, QR stated, without qualification, that it was prepared to negotiate in good faith for access to NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2446">1034 Although, as I have said, Mr O'Rourke was not an open and forthcoming witness, I accept his evidence that third party access was an important issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2447">He said, and I accept, that the exclusive nature of a lease to NRC would have left no flexibility for QR or other operators to access the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2448">1035 This position does not conflict with Mr O'Rourke's expressed fear of the AR terminal falling into the hands of a hostile competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2449">He made it clear in conceding his fear that this was brought about by the prospect of QR wanting to compete for business on the standard gauge track south from Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2450">He pointed to the consequent need to avoid the disadvantage of being at the mercy of QR's competitor, and what the law would grant to QR by way of access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2451">1036 Mr O'Rourke's evidence of the reasons for his change of position in early 1997 is corroborated by documents which began to emerge in 1998 and by the evidence of Mr Hearsch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2452">1037 It is clear from the minutes of a meeting of QR's Freight Group of 21 January 1998, to which I referred at [360], that a business rationale, other than mere injury to its competitor, underlay the refusal to grant a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2453">1038 The business advantages stated in the minutes of 21 January 1998 included QR being perceived as an "honest broker" of the standard gauge terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2454">That followed upon QR's previous combative stance in opposing third party access to Carpentaria Transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2455">But this was followed by a change of heart and a perceived need on QR's part to see the AR terminal administered by an apparently neutral party, albeit that the NAG was itself a division of QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2456">1039 The other business advantages pointed to in the minutes of 21 January 1998 included synergies from the operation of narrow and standard gauge terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2457">1040 An information paper dated 31 March 1998, signed by Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch, explained the change of position on the lease as taking into account the expected emergence of third party operators on the standard gauge line as well as the increased likelihood that QR would extend its operations into "the interstate sphere", that is to say the standard gauge line south to Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2458">The paper referred to the major structural changes and reforms taking place in the industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2459">This was a reference to the Hilmer Reforms and their consequences; see [368].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2460">1041 Those considerations were borne out in a memorandum from Mr O'Rourke and Mr Hearsch to the Queensland Minister of Transport dated 1 April 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2461">The memorandum stated that QR received many enquiries from prospective third party operators to run containers to southern ports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2462">It stated that although the AR terminal still had substantial unused capacity, those operators could not gain access as they would be in competition with NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2463">The memorandum stated that:-
 
 "QR's intention is to operate the terminal as a genuine common user facility in line with its own container terminal developments elsewhere throughout Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2464">" 
 

1042 Mr Hearsch's evidence, which I accept, was that the reasons underlying QR's decision to take back control of the AR terminal were wider than merely maximising revenue and return on its assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2465">He emphasised QR's concern about increasing the use of rail facilities generally, not solely by QR but also by NRC and other organisations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2466">1043 Mr Hearsch also explained the reasons for refusal of a long term lease to NRC as based upon a concern about the undesirability for any party to have exclusive use of the AR terminal under a lease which had made it extremely difficult in a practical sense for others to gain access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2467">1044 In this regard, Mr Hearsch pointed out that several potential or existing third party operators had actively sought access but that NRC had done virtually everything in its power to impede access, notwithstanding what was required under the EA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2468">1045 This evidence illustrates the artificiality of the concession extracted from Mr O'Rourke that no matter who controlled the AR terminal, that entity was bound by law to give access to third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2469">It shows that notwithstanding Mr O'Rourke's concessions on this topic, his insistence upon third party access as a relevant consideration was consistent with the objective facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2470">1046 Thus, the business rationale for QR's refusal to grant a lease in 1997 and 1998, insofar as it relates to operations on the standard gauge network comprise the following elements:-
 
 &#8226; avoiding the disadvantage of having the AR terminal controlled by a competitor;
 &#8226; running the AR terminal as a common user facility so as to secure access for QR and third parties;
 &#8226; by securing access for itself, ensuring that QR would be able to run trains on the standard gauge line south to Sydney and Melbourne;
 &#8226; increasing the volume of usage of the AR terminal for rail transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2471">Generally, thereby securing its long term potential as against other modes of transport, in particular, road; and
 &#8226; "synergies" from the operation of narrow and standard gauge terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2472">

1047 Commencing in the year 2000, QR's business rationale was more fully expressed in documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2473">1048 In his memorandum of 20 March 2000 to Mr Bruce Wilson of Queensland Transport, Mr O'Rourke referred to the place of the AR terminal in facilitating QR's own national strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2474">He said that QR would seek reciprocal access to southern terminals in addition to securing its own capacity at the AR terminal; see [418] --- [419] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2475">1049 In his oral evidence Mr O'Rourke accepted that QR considered control of the AR terminal to be a bargaining chip for negotiations for access to Southern Terminals and that this was a reason for refusing a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2476">1050 QR's emphasis upon control of the AR terminal as a bargaining chip or leverage for entry into southern terminals was a continuing theme in strategy papers throughout the years from 2000 to 2002; see eg [440], [465], [486] and [514].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2477">1051 The benefit of being able to secure reciprocal rights was referred to by Mr Buckley in his email of 18 August 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2478">The email also stated that other benefits of control included the fact that existing monthly lease payments by NRC did not reflect the current value of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2479">1052 Mr Buckley was cross-examined quite vigorously about the strategy of using the AR terminal as leverage to secure access to southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2480">The vigour of the cross-examination was no doubt increased by the fact that Mr Buckley was an unsatisfactory witness who prevaricated about whether QR's strategy included the concept of leverage into southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2481">It is plain that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2482">Yet Mr Buckley was decidedly uncomfortable in conceding it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2483">He seemed to think that the concession would be adverse to QR's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2484">But his discomfort was misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2485">In my view, access to southern terminals was a legitimate part of QR's business rationale for regaining control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2486">1053 In his letter of 19 September 2000 to Mr Graham, Mr O'Rourke described the AR terminal as the gateway to fulfilling QR's national ambitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2487">His reference to not being beholden to an unknown potential competitor emphasised QR's desire to have security of access to its own terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2488">1054 The letter of 19 September 2000 also records QR's belief that NRC was not operating the AR terminal efficiently, in particular that it was not utilising the AR terminal's available capacity; that is to say that NRC was not interested in maximising the usage of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2489">1055 There was further reference to the use of the AR terminal as a potential equity bargaining chip in Mr George's memorandum of 16 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2490">This memorandum is important because it records the desire to prevent the AR terminal from being conducted as a common user facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2491">This disclosed the preferred strategy of conducting it as a multi-user facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2492">The explanation for this was the desire to avoid the vagaries of determining access rights according to law, instead ensuring that QR was in a position to bargain with others for such access rights as QR was prepared to offer by way of commercial agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2493">1056 Mr O'Rourke recognised the difficulties that QR might have in accessing the AR terminal under a common user regime in his letter of 20 October 2000 to Mr Hunt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2494">1057 Mr George returned to the theme of opposing common user in favour of multi-user, and the benefits flowing from this, in his notes on the letter of 30 October 2000 from Mr Hunt to Mr O'Rourke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2495">1058 QR's consternation that the AR terminal not be declared common user appears in graphic detail in the notes of the meeting of 6 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2496">The reciprocity theme, that is leverage into southern terminals, was again mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2497">1059 The strategic issues paper of 13 February 2001 also emphasised leverage for entry into southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2498">It said that control of the AR terminal gave QR bargaining power in its efforts to enter interstate markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2499">It described the AR terminal as the "key to the standard gauge access to Queensland".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2500">1060 The leverage theme was again referred to in Mr Buckley's emails of 9 July 2001 and 14 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2501">The latter email also referred to the objectives of achieving a commercial return and ensuring that throughput at the AR terminal was maximised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2502">1061 There was more of the same in QR's strategy paper of 12 September 2002, prepared by QR's supposedly ringfenced NAG in consultation with the C&amp;FS division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2503">That paper also stated that the NAG did not currently have the skills or systems to manage the AR terminal and that if QR were simply interested in obtaining a return on its property investment it would be appropriate to lease it to the highest bidder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2504">1062 The last mentioned comment emphasises that QR's objective was not merely to obtain a return on the AR terminal as a property investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2505">1063 The paper of 12 September 2002 also shows that QR was aware that resuming control of the AR terminal was contrary to PN's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2506">The only course that would have been favourable to PN was continuation of the status quo or grant of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2507">1064 The 12 September 2002 paper contains a graphic recognition by QR of its own shortcomings in terminal management, describing its track record as poor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2508">1065 The Board submission of 2 December 2002 seeking approval for the termination of PN's tenancy puts forward four significant matters in support of the proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2509">These were, first, increasing the revenue by $600,000 per annum over the existing rental; second, increasing rail freight business at the expense of road; third, rationalising narrow and standard gauge operations with savings of $3 million per annum; fourth saving $10 million capital expenditure on intrastate operations at Moolabin; see [525].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2510">1066 Those four business objectives were reiterated by QR in its draft business case in support of the resolution to issue the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2511">In addition, the draft business case stated that continuation of the existing tenancy arrangements with PN would impede QR's ability to enhance its own business operations through the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2512">Reference was made to the establishment of a multi-user facility at the AR terminal with common use for the marshalling yards; see [531] --- [535].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2513">1067 The submission to QR's Board meeting of 25 February 2003 at which it was resolved to issue the notice to quit recommended that there be a transparent access regime which would accommodate PN as a core customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2514">1068 Although it was put to Mr Scheuber in cross-examination that some of the background statements in the Board submission were inaccurate, I do not think that anything turns on this; see [521].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2515">What seems to me to be important is that it was not put to Mr Scheuber in cross-examination that any of the matters which grounded the business rationale for the decision were misplaced or were not genuinely part of the rationale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2516">1069 PN submitted that the repeatedly declared multi-user objective cannot detract from the substantial character of QR's conduct which involved the calculated consequence of damaging NRC as a known competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2517">That was not an attack on the existence of multi-user as a plank of QR's business objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2518">In any event, for reasons stated elsewhere, I reject the submission that it was QR's aim to damage NRC otherwise than through ruthless competitive behaviour inconsistent with the objectives underlying s 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2519">1070 I do not consider that Queensland Transport's initial preference for common user, which it subsequently abandoned in favour of multi-user, supports PN's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2520">1071 Mr Scheuber was taken to the draft business case in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2521">At first, he could not recall having seen the document but the effect of his evidence was that he acknowledged that it was the document endorsed by the Board of QR at its meeting on 25 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2522">1072 Significantly, Mr Scheuber said in cross-examination that QR believed in February 2003 that the rental paid by PN was below commercial rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2523">As I have said, nothing was put to him to challenge the existence of the other elements of the business strategy as part of QR's business rationale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2524">1073 It follows that I find that QR's business rationale for the issue of the notice to quit included the four matters listed in the board submission of 2 December 2002 and endorsed on 25 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2525">1074 Other elements of the business rationale were: first, QR's belief that the AR terminal was underutilised and not efficiently managed by PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2526">Mr Scheuber gave evidence to this effect which I accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2527">This is related to the objective of increasing use of the AR terminal, at the expense of road, thereby increasing QR's return on the asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2528">1075 Second, and finally, quite plainly, QR sought to be in a position to use the AR terminal as an equity bargaining chip or leverage for entry to southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2529">This goes some way to explain its obsession with the concept of multi-user in preference to common user.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2530">1076 Thus, the six elements which I have identified formed QR's business rationale for its decision to issue the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2531">1077 In my opinion, it follows that QR had a rational business explanation for the impugned conduct, that is to say the refusal to grant a long term lease in 1997/1998 and the issue of the notice to quit in May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2532">I identified at [1046] the five elements of the business rationale for refusing to grant a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2533">1078 As Heerey J said at first instance in Boral , this is a factor which points against a finding that the conduct constitutes taking advantage of market power: see (1999) 166 ALR 410 at 440.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2534">His Honour's views were adopted in the High Court: see [150] and [170].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2535">1079 It seems to me that these were matters of commercial judgment which, when considered in the light of QR's continuing offer of access to PN and its proposed conversion of the AR terminal to a multi-user facility, suggest that this was not an exercise of market power or a taking advantage of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2536">1080 Mr Ergas considered the question of how QR would behave in a competitive market by assuming that QR would provide PN with a 30 year lease because PN is a more efficient terminal operator than QR and, accordingly, it would be more profitable for QR if PN controls the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2537">He criticised QR's conduct as irrational in a competitive market and supported his argument by reference to various hypothetical examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2538">1081 The effect of Mr Ergas' counterfactual was that, without a substantial degree of market power, no firm would, as a matter of commercial judgment, take the course which it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2539">Instead, he argued that as a matter of judgment, QR would grant PN a 30 year lease because this was the most profitable outcome in a competitive market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2540">1082 But, in my opinion, Mr Ergas' argument is flawed for at least four reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2541">1083 First, Mr Ergas made his own assessment of who would be the most efficient operator of the AR terminal on scant information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2542">It is true that there are internal QR documents which recognise its perceived shortcomings as a matter of historical fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2543">However, as Mrs Smith points out, entrants often lack expertise at the time of entry; what is important is whether the new entrant will have sufficient time to become established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2544">It is to be noted that QR has committed to engaging an appropriately qualified intermodal rail terminal expert during the twelve month transition period prior to QR resuming control, as well as PN terminal staff who may become redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2545">1084 Second, as Mr Ergas conceded in cross-examination, it was not his perception of who would be the most efficient operator that was critical; rather it was a question of the owner's belief of what would be the most profitable course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2546">He added the rider that the owner's belief would have to be a reasonable one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2547">But there is nothing to suggest that QR's belief is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2548">In the end its business judgment may or may not be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2549">But courts do not lightly ignore the evidence of honest businessmen on matters of business judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2550">1085 Third, Mr Ergas did not take into account the whole package of business advantages identified by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2551">He failed to consider elements such as QR's desire for certainty of access to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2552">1086 Fourth, there were a number of errors in Mr Ergas' assumptions which adversely affected the cogency of his analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2553">For example, he wrongly assumed that the AR terminal was already operated as a multi-user facility and he assumed that QR would discriminate against PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2554">1087 Mrs Smith's counterfactual assumed that QR would be likely to require PN to give up control of the AR terminal if it expected a greater profit in the long term by doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2555">1088 PN criticised Mrs Smith's approach as based on faulty assumptions, including an assumption that there are several terminals equivalent to the AR terminal for standard gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2556">That criticism is well placed but I accept the general effect of her approach which is plainly consistent with objective facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2557">As McHugh J said in Boral at [260], a rational business firm seeks to maximise profit and to increase its share of the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2558">That is the obvious explanation of QR's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2559">1089 There is a further reason why Mr Ergas' approach must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2560">It is to be found in the reasons of the High Court in Queensland Wire and the trilogy of cases which explain the full impact of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2561">1090 As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, the operation of s 46 is predicated upon an assumption that competition is the means to protect the interests of consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2562">Competition is by its nature deliberate and ruthless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2563">All of the majority justices in Boral pointed out that s 46 is concerned with promoting competition, not protecting competitors: see [87], [160], [164] and [260].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2564">Injuries to rivals are a necessary bi-product of vigorous competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2565">1091 PN's approach is fundamentally flawed because it has at its heart the protection of its own position as a competitor of QR, not the interests of competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2566">It seeks to advance its own private interests over that of the public interest in promoting competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2567">It fails to distinguish between monopolistic practices which are prohibited and vigorous competition which is not: Queensland Wire at 202 per Dawson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2568">1092 Moreover, the suggestion that QR took advantage of market power is at odds with three further principles which emerge from the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2569">First, I do not see how it can be said that to obtain possession with a view to converting the AR terminal to a common user facility as was sought in 1997-98 or a multi-user facility in 2003, was facilitated by the existence of the power: Melway at [51] and Rural Press at [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2570">1093 Second, I do not see that QR's desire to run the AR terminal as a common user or multi-user facility gave it an advantage it would not have had in the absence of market power: Boral at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2571">1094 Third, QR's conduct cannot be said to have been "necessarily" an exercise of market power: Melway at [68].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2572">1095 I will deal briefly with Mr Ergas' contention that a number of the clauses of QR's open offer in the Draft Terminal Services Agreement, as amended on 6 July 2005, constituted a misuse of market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2573">Mr Ergas argued that only a firm with market power could make such an offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2574">He argued that in a competitive market, confronted by such an offer, the firm would go elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2575">1096 Mr Ergas' attack focussed upon three clauses of the draft document (as amended) which I have set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2576">They are: first, the provision dealing with late trains contained in cl 6.7; second, the provision for PN to be able to increase the monthly throughput in the capacity of the AR terminal, in addition to the right to a 10% increase in the allocated monthly TEU provided for in cl 1(a)(ii) of Schedule 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2577">The provision for additional throughput is found in cl 7.5, which includes in cl 7.5(d) the notion of a deemed permanent increase with resulting increased costs for PN.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2578">1097 The third clause attacked by Mr Ergas was cl 7.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2579">This also deals with additional capacity and provides, in effect, for PN to underwrite the cost of any expansion works required to carry the additional throughput.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2580">A hurdle rate of 15% is set.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2581">1098 Mr Ergas said that these clauses discriminated against PN with no offsetting benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2582">He said that they would have the effect of raising rivals' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2583">He also said that the deemed permanent increase in capacity in cl 7.5(d) was a harsh allocation of risks, that the risk of expansion was borne entirely by PN, and that the hurdle rate of return of 15% was higher than the rates allowed by regulators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2584">1099 Mrs Smith's evidence was that it is somewhat hazardous to pick out individual clauses of a proposed contract and then seek to comment on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2585">This is because they are part of an overall framework of commercial negotiations between parties, as to which some outcomes on some clauses will be good for one party whereas on other clauses the result will not be as good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2586">This is plainly right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2587">As Mrs Smith said, it is the cut and thrust of everyday business activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2588">1100 The effect of Mrs Smith's evidence on the three clauses which were debated was that these provisions did not manifest exclusionary practices but were, rather, an attempt to allocate risk between the parties as part of ordinary business negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2589">She also pointed to the business rationale underlying the clauses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2590">She pointed to the reasonable degree of flexibility contained in the clauses, thereby balancing the interests of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2591">1101 As to cl 7.5 and the cap on monthly throughput, Mrs Smith said that capacity will usually be a trade-off between the competing objectives of the terminal owner and the user.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2592">The terminal user will wish to have maximum capacity but if demand fluctuates, the owner will be left with unused capacity and diminished profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2593">Mrs Smith considered that cl 7.5(d), though not perfect, was a reasonable attempt to deal with the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2594">She said that a cap on capacity was consistent with prudent business practice because QR wanted to be able to supply the contracted amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2595">1102 Mrs Smith considered that cl 7.6, which deals with expansion of the terminal to meet additional capacity, was part of the same problem as was raised by cl 7.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2596">She saw it as a reasonable attempt to align the competing interests of the terminal owner and the terminal user.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2597">1103 In my opinion Mrs Smith's approach is to be preferred to that of Mr Ergas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2598">Although she accepted the principle that conduct which has the effect of raising rivals' costs may constitute exclusionary conduct which constitutes taking advantage, she did not accept that the clauses in question had that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2599">1104 It is unnecessary to add to what I have set out above about Mrs Smith's views on cl 7.5 and 7.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2600">However, I will refer briefly to the business rationale and construction of cl 6.7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2601">1105 The proper construction of cl 6.7 seems to me to impose an obligation on QR to use reasonable endeavours to provide services for late trains: see Transfield at 101.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2602">The proper construction of the clause is not controlled by the heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2603">The clause is not clearly expressed but the agreement to use "best endeavours" must be seen as a proviso to the opening words of cl 6.7(a)(i) which appear on their face to deny such an obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2604">1106 The business rationale for the clause is the efficient operation of the AR terminal, whilst at the same time making provision for QR to use reasonable endeavours to service PN's late trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2605">1107 In summary, it is my opinion that even if QR had a substantial degree of power in the market at the time of the impugned conduct, it did not take advantage of the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2606">Whether QR has taken advantage: North Coast Rail Infrastructure Market 
 
1108 For the same reasons as were given in respect of the SG Rail Infrastructure Market, QR did not take advantage of any market power in the market for providing terminal access to narrow gauge trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2607">1109 Although many of the business advantages identified in relation to the SG Rail Infrastructure Market related to standard gauge service, the overall business rationale related to the AR terminal as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2608">QR saw a greater benefit in seeking to generate profits for itself by operating the AR terminal as a common or multi-user facility, in particular in securing access for standard gauge services and rationalising services between standard and narrow gauge, than renting the AR terminal to PN under a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2609">Whether QR had a proscribed purpose 
 
1110 In view of my earlier findings, it is unnecessary to deal with the question of purpose but I will do so briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2610">1111 Purpose involves the notion of an intention to achieve the result spoken of in one or other of ss 46(1)(a) , (b) or (c): Queensland Wire at 214 and Melway at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2611">In the present case, PN contended that QR's purpose was to damage NRC or to deter it from engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market: s 46(1)(a) and/or (c), or to prevent NRC or Toll from entering the North Coast Rail Linehaul Market or from engaging in competitive conduct in that market: s 46(1)(b) and/or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2612">1112 In making a finding of purpose the Court is not so much concerned with the search for the "directing mind and will" of the corporation; it is concerned with inferences from the conduct of the corporation and of any other relevant person as well as other relevant circumstances: Safeway at [342] --- [343].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2613">1113 An inference of proscribed purposes is to be drawn on the balance of probabilities, after giving due weight to the rule in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336: see Safeway at [341].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2614">1114 The matters which I took into account in finding that QR had a legitimate business rationale for the impugned conduct point against a finding of proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2615">1115 PN submitted that a proscribed purpose was to be inferred from a number of relevant circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2616">PN relied in particular on evidence which disclosed that it was QR's intention, from the time of the announcement of NRC's privatisation, to prevent a hostile or unfriendly acquirer of NRC from enjoying long term exclusive occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2617">PN also relied on evidence which showed an appreciation by QR that NRC would be worse off as a result of loss of control of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2618">1116 It is true that Mr O'Rourke conceded that QR's change of position in early 1997 was actuated in part by a desire to deprive its competitor, NRC, of the advantage of controlling the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2619">1117 Mr O'Rourke was also aware of the power conferred on whoever controlled the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2620">And he knew that this was a power in relation to behaviour in a competitive market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2621">He knew that by denying NRC exclusive control of the AR terminal, QR would be in a position to give to others no greater access than the law required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2622">1118 Mr O'Rourke also conceded that he appreciated that control of the AR terminal would be an advantage for a competitor such as NRC and a corresponding disadvantage for QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2623">He knew that there was a world of difference between controlling the AR terminal and merely having access to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2624">1119 Mr Scheuber saw the opportunity that QR had, as owner of the AR terminal, to use that asset to enhance its prospects of taking business away from competitors including NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2625">A prime consideration informing QR's thinking was its ownership of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2626">Regaining control of the AR terminal would deprive NRC as QR's main competitor, of the "huge" advantage conferred by control of the AR terminal when trying to operate a national rail network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2627">1120 Mr Scheuber was also aware that depriving NRC of control would deny it the business advantage of seeking to match its future growth with capacity because it would have to deal with QR for access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2628">1121 There is also ample documentary evidence to which I have previously referred which shows that QR well knew that if QR regained management control of the AR terminal, NRC would lose the substantial advantage of control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2629">To that extent, QR knew that NRC would be worse off than under the status quo and worse off than it would have been through the grant of a long term lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2630">1122 PN also relied extensively on the wealth of documentary material to which I have previously referred in relation to QR's intention to use its ownership and control of the AR terminal as a bargaining chip for entry into southern terminals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2631">1123 But it seems to me that there are four essential reasons why PN has failed to establish that QR was actuated by a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2632">1124 First, there are constant reminders in the authorities that competition is a ruthless process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2633">As Mason CJ and Wilson J said in Queensland Wire at 191, competitors always try to injure each other by taking away sales and these injuries are the inevitable result of the competition that s 46 is designed to promote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2634">In Boral at [88], Gleeson CJ and Callinan J pointed to the danger of confusing aggressive intent with anti-competitive behaviour: see also per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [160] and per McHugh J at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2635">1125 In my opinion, the matters relied upon by PN to support a finding of proscribed purpose fail to distinguish between aggressive competitive intent and the anti-competitive behaviour which constitutes the proscribed purposes stated in s 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2636">1126 Second, to establish a proscribed purpose according to the test stated by the High Court, it was necessary for PN to prove that QR had the intention of disadvantaging NRC in the manner alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2637">It seems to me to follow that it was for PN to prove that QR's aim was to deprive it of control of the AR terminal for the purposes stated in s 46(1)(a) and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2638">I would therefore need to be satisfied that the aim of the exercise was to disadvantage NRC in that way by taking back control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2639">1127 However, in my view, taking back control of the AR terminal was necessary for QR to achieve its own corporate purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2640">Regaining control was therefore a consequence of the exercise, rather than the actuating motive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2641">This was the effect of the evidence of Mr O'Rourke, Mr Scheuber and Mr Hearsch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2642">There is nothing in the documentary evidence which suggests otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2643">1128 Third, in my view, QR's longstanding offer to grant access rights to NRC and its desire to establish a common user or multi-user facility at the AR terminal are inconsistent with the purposes for which NRC contends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2644">This distinguishes the case from NT Power, where the infrastructure owner appreciated the existence of its market power and of the capacity to exercise that power to deliver access to the infrastructure: see NT Power at [150].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2645">1129 Fourth, although they post date the impugned conduct, the General Freight Agreement of 10 November 2003 for access to the East Coast Line, and the North Coast Access Agreement of 1 October 2004 for access to the North Coast Line, are inconsistent with the suggestion of proscribed purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2646">1130 In cross-examination of Mr Merrigan it was suggested that certain observations in his report of March 2000 revealed a purpose of eliminating NRC as a competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2647">He was taken to his remarks that NRC would not be a player in the long term and that this would be to QR's competitive advantage; see [422] --- [423].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2648">Mr Merrigan said that this was a reference to NRC ceasing to exist as such after privatisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2649">There is force in Mr Walker's proposition that this was "meritless fencing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2650">But I do not see that the comments of a consultant to QR, without more, are sufficient to give rise to an inference of proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2651">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2652">QR'S CROSS-CLAIM UNDER SECTION 46 
 
1131 QR claims that NRC has breached s 46 of the Act by refusing a number of applications for access to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2653">The access applications fall into two categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2654">The first category consists of applications made by CRT/Freightcorp during 1998 and 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2655">I set out some of the correspondence commencing at [390].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2656">It is unnecessary to supplement it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2657">1132 The second category consists of seven access applications made by QR during 2003 and 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2658">I set out the details of applications 1 to 5 and some of the relevant correspondence at [549] to [559].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2659">I will supplement that material, to the extent necessary, below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2660">1133 QR claims that NRC has market power in the SG Rail Infrastructure Market by reason of its control of the AR terminal and its control of the majority of the paths for rail tracks between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2661">QR alleged that NRC took advantage of its power in the market for a number of proscribed purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2662">1134 The proscribed purposes are said to be preventing QR from entering into, or engaging in competitive conduct in the East Coast Rail Linehaul Market and substantially damaging QR, and preventing CRT/Freightcorp from entering that market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2663">1135 The question whether NRC took advantage of market power, and whether it did so for a proscribed purpose, in respect of the Freightcorp requests, turns on the evidence of Mr McNamara who was at the relevant time NRC's regional manager, Queensland .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2664">The issue was also addressed in cross-examination of Mr Graham to which I will refer later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2665">1136 The question of taking advantage and proscribed purpose in relation to the access applications made by QR are more complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2666">Those questions turn in part upon whether I accept the evidence of two experts called by QR to support its contention that there was capacity in the AR terminal to accommodate the access sought by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2667">The experts were Mr Merrigan and Professor Ferreira.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2668">1137 NRC contends that it did not refuse the applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2669">Whether or not that is so does not seem to me to matter because it is common ground that, with one exception, the access applications were not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2670">The substantial reason given by NRC for its failure to grant access was that access would require additional capacity at the AR terminal and it did not wish to pursue negotiations whilst NRC's own tenure issues were unresolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2671">1138 QR contends that the reason given was not correct, though not deliberately so, and that this indicated that NRC took advantage of market power for a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2672">Market Power 
 
1139 NRC admitted that it controlled the majority of the contracted train paths on the East Coast Line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2673">Evidence was given by Mr Buckley, which, on this point I accept, that the market for carriage of freight by rail between Brisbane and Sydney/Melbourne has been dominated by NRC, with QR's market share standing at about 5%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2674">NRC's share at the relevant times stood at approximately 95%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2675">1140 Mr Ergas accepted that, subject to two considerations, NRC's control of the AR terminal gave it market power in the relevant infrastructure market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2676">The two considerations were the threat of QR building an alternative terminal, or extending the Q-Link terminal to accommodate standard gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2677">The second was said to be the need for NRC to utilise land owned by QR adjoining the AR terminal in order to expand capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2678">1141 As to the possibility of QR constructing an alternative terminal, Mr Ergas pointed to documents which he said, from "distant memory" suggested that this was a credible possibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2679">He accepted that for this consideration to be a constraint it would need to be both credible and to have been believed as such by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2680">1142 There was consideration in the George Deutsch Report in 1999 of the possibility of converting the Q-Link terminal to accommodate standard gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2681">QR submitted that the George Deutsch Report did not contemplate the use of standard gauge track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2682">However, this is not borne out by the terms of the document which states that the tracks could be dual gauged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2683">As I said earlier, the George Deusch Report states that the Q-Link terminal could, if necessary, support interstate standard gauge activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2684">1143 However, apart from the George Deutsch Report, there is no suggestion in the evidence of the possibility of QR constructing an alternative terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2685">Indeed, Mr Buckley's evidence, which I accept in the absence of cross-examination, was that QR does not believe that its current activities justify such an expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2686">1144 It was not put to any of the QR directors or other relevant QR witnesses that QR had the intention of constructing an alternative terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2687">Nor was it suggested that QR had ever made such a threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2688">There was no evidence from directors or senior officers of NRC that NRC believed that such a threat existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2689">1145 Accordingly, I reject the suggestion made by Mr Ergas that the threat of QR constructing an alternative terminal was a credible one and that it was believed as such by NRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2690">In short, it was pure economic theory unsupported by any evidentiary basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2691">1146 So too was Mr Ergas' suggestion of a possible constraint arising from the need to utilise QR's land to expand NRC's operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2692">It is true that Mr Lawrence's evidence was that in 2004 the AR terminal was operating at full capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2693">But he accepted that this was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2694">Nevertheless, I accept that he believed that the AR terminal was operating at near full capacity although with scope to change practices to accommodate more traffic for NRC if the need arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2695">1147 But it does not follow that the need for additional land constituted a constraint upon NRC which precludes a finding that it lacked market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2696">I do not consider that NRC developed that proposition through witnesses of fact or in documentary evidence to lead to such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2697">There was nothing to suggest that NRC saw the need for additional land as an urgent matter at the time when the impugned conduct occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2698">I reject the suggestion that it constituted a relevant constraint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2699">1148 Mrs Smith's evidence was the control of the AR terminal by NRC gave it control of an essential input for the supply of rail linehaul services on the East Coast Line thereby giving it exclusionary market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2700">I accept her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2701">Mr McNamara's evidence on the Freightcorp issue 
 
1149 The correspondence relating to the Freightcorp access request which I have set out at [391] --- [397] does not disclose the reasons why access was not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2702">The reasons, given in other correspondence, were to the effect that the proposed times were not compatible with NRC's operations and that there was a lack of capacity to accommodate Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2703">1150 Mr McNamara's affidavit evidence was that he believed that the Freightcorp trains could have been accommodated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2704">He said that there was sufficient capacity for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2705">1151 In his oral evidence in chief, Mr McNamara said that he was not "going to go out of my way to foster competition" and that, since he had not received any specific advice to enable access to proceed, he "chose to delay the process as long as I could".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2706">1152 He was then asked by Mr O'Donnell how he delayed the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2707">Mr McNamara's answer was that NRC went into committee processes wherever various concerns about access for Freightcorp were discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2708">He also said that he reported to Mr Fullerton and Mr Graham but he received no direction to speed up the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2709">1153 In cross-examination by Mr Walker, Mr McNamara agreed that the committee processes were genuine and that they were appropriate to deal with the applications on their merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2710">He added that NRC could have worked faster but he agreed that he did not deal dishonestly with the applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2711">He agreed that the committee deliberations were not "some fake process".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2712">He added that he was supporting NRC's position in the marketplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2713">1154 In re-examination Mr McNamara said he was protecting NRC's revenue by delaying competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2714">1155 Mr McNamara seemed to me to be an honest witness but the apparent force of his evidence in chief must be read in the light of the concessions made in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2715">In my view, the effect of his evidence in chief and in re-examination was to put his own interpretation on the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2716">It is true that NRC was not in a hurry to deal with the applications but it does not necessarily follow that it exploited the position for its own advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2717">1156 The concept of taking advantage has no moral overtones, but it would be a large step to say that the proper use of committee processes to deal with considerations such as track access amounts to the use of market power contemplated by s 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2718">In some circumstances resort to a committee may be a fa&ccedil;ade for denial of supply or inordinate delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2719">I am not satisfied that this is what occurred here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2720">1157 I accept that in a competitive market NRC would have provided access to Freighcorp if it had the capacity to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2721">However, capacity is a somewhat flexible concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2722">In the present context it seems to me that it was for QR to establish that NRC could have accommodated the Freightcorp requests without adversely affecting its own operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2723">I am not persuaded that Mr McNamara's evidence establishes this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2724">I do not doubt that his belief about NRC's capacity was genuinely held but it is plain that the ultimate question was not for him to decide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2725">It was to be dealt with by the committee process, properly established for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2726">1158 I do not consider that this constitutes a sufficient connection to amount to taking advantage within the principle stated by the High Court in Melway and Boral .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2727">1159 Nor do I consider, in light of the concessions made by Mr McNamara in cross-examination, that NRC engaged in the conduct for a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2728">Mr Graham's evidence on the Freightcorp issue 
 
1160 Mr Graham accepted that Freightcorp was the first competitor to emerge as a result of the Hilmer reforms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2729">He was asked whether it would be fair to characterise NRC's response as being one of making things difficult for Freightcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2730">He replied:-
 
 "No more than Freightcorp's response for our request for access to Cook's River was to make things difficult for us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2731">" 
 

1161 Mr Graham went on to deny that NRC's response was to make it difficult for Freightcorp to get access to the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2732">He said that "both parties acted in their own commercial interests at the time, no more no less".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2733">1162 I do not consider that this evidence, particularly when read in light of Mr McNamara's evidence about the committee process, establishes a purpose of preventing Freightcorp from entering the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2734">QR's access applications 
 
1163 QR's access application 3 was granted in March 2004 and an agreement for access was signed in June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2735">1164 On 29 October 2004, QR wrote to NRC stating that, since NRC failed to grant access applications 1, 2, 4 and 5, despite the passage of many months, QR did not press those applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2736">They were replaced by two new applications described as applications 6 and 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2737">1165 Application 6 was for standard gauge services arriving during the day and departing at night as well as a number of narrow gauge services in essentially the same terms as requested in applications 1, 2 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2738">1166 The application was for, firstly, six standard gauge services (up to 800 metre train length) arriving on Monday at 04.30 and departing 23.00; arriving Tuesday --- Sunday at 11.30 and departing at 23.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2739">Secondly, six narrow gauge services (up to 600 metre train length) arriving Monday --- Saturday at 20.00 and departing at 04.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2740">1167 Application 7, which was an alternative to application 6, was a stand-alone request for standard gauge services in the same terms as the request for six standard gauge services contained in application 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2741">1168 QR contended that, in failing to grant the applications, NRC made untrue statements about the lack of capacity of the AR terminal to accommodate the trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2742">This was at the heart of QR's case that NRC has taken advantage of its market power for a proscribed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2743">1169 In considering the correctness or otherwise of NRC's assertions about lack of capacity, it is necessary to ask whether the evidence of Mr Merrigan and Professor Ferreira established that the AR terminal had the capacity to accommodate the trains at the times stated in the applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2744">It is not a question of the capacity of the AR terminal generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2745">1170 In my opinion the evidence of Mr Merrigan and Professor Ferreira had severe limitations which I will address below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2746">Mr Merrigan's evidence 
 
1171 Mr Merrigan approached the question of whether NRC could accommodate the additional trains having regard to the operations of the AR terminal as a stand-alone operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2747">He accepted that different considerations apply when looking at the matter from the point of view of an overall network operation conducted on a national basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2748">1172 Mr Merrigan conceded that it was perfectly reasonable for NRC, operating a national network, to regard its current management of the AR terminal as a management method which used up the capacity entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2749">1173 Mr Merrigan went on to say that, for the period up to 9 March 2005, the way in which NRC was using the AR terminal exhausted the capacity which might otherwise be available to third party users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2750">He agreed "that anybody in National Rail who took the position that there was no capacity available for other users would be speaking reasonably".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2751">1174 I accept the concessions made by Mr Merrigan but I have considerable reservations about the reliability of his evidence as to the ability of the AR terminal to accommodate the additional trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2752">1175 First, Mr Merrigan failed in his affidavits to disclose his prior involvement with this matter in a number of respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2753">He failed to disclose his involvement in the preparation of the George Deutsch Report, an involvement which he initially denied and later conceded, albeit reluctantly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2754">He also failed to disclose in his affidavits the extent of his prior involvement with QR in particular in its response to the George Deutsch Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2755">1176 Second, Mr Merrigan did not observe the operations of the AR terminal during the peak periods of October, November and December.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2756">Instead, he based his assessment on data from observations during non-peak periods, which suggested greater availability for new trains and more freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2757">1177 Third, there was some confusion in Mr Merrigan's evidence as to the number of days on which additional trains could be accommodated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2758">He changed from five nights a week to three nights a week and then sought to return to five nights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2759">1178 Fourth, some of the additional trains could only be accommodated if substantial operational changes and physical alterations were made at the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2760">Professor Ferreira's evidence 
 
1179 Professor Ferreira's analysis was based on computer modelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2761">He used a tool he developed to estimate maximum capacity at the terminal, which he named the "Intermodal Terminal Capacity Analysis Tool" ("ITCAT").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2762">He did not carry out the task of assigning specific trains to specific lengths or locations of track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2763">Instead, he proceeded on the basis that there was an aggregated length of track of 3,600 metres available and he identified windows of opportunity for his proposed trains at times which he assumed to be off-peak.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2764">1180 However, it seems to me that this analysis has a number of shortcomings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2765">In particular, Professor Ferreira acknowledged that he did not test for feasibility of implementation of his proposed services by following through how there might be effects or influences from other train services and on the interdependence of other resources at the AR terminal, such as storage capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2766">1181 He acknowledged that in practice the critical terminal services are interdependent and that he had left this out of his first report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2767">His supplementary report failed to overcome this defect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2768">Mr Lawrence's evidence 
 
1182 QR relied on a number of apparent concessions made by Mr Lawrence in cross-examination to support its argument that the statements made in Mr Smith's letters, rejecting access, were not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2769">1183 First, QR pointed to a statement in Mr Smith's letter of 16 July 2004 that NRC did not have sufficient capacity due to the loading of the copper train.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2770">This was said to be incorrect and to have been acknowledged as such by Mr Lawrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2771">1184 Mr Lawrence conceded that the copper train occupied only about 270 metres, leaving another 900 metres of vacant track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2772">However, I do not consider that Mr Lawrence went on to concede that the loading of the copper train was not an impediment to the introduction of the new service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2773">His answers on that topic were equivocal but he did not prevaricate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2774">Mr Lawrence was an honest witness who made concessions on various matters when it was appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2775">1185 It was put to Mr Lawrence that the statements in Mr Smith's letter to the effect that NRC did not have capacity due to loading of the copper train, were incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2776">The effect of Mr Lawrence's evidence is that he resisted that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2777">I accept his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2778">He was the source of the information in Mr Smith's letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2779">It is therefore not to the point that Mr Smith was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2780">1186 Second, QR relied on Mr Lawrence's concession that since July 2004, QR has been able to process additional trains totalling about 3,500 metres in length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2781">However, that concession does not establish that NRC would have been able to accommodate the new QR services at the times and on the days that QR has sought access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2782">The additional 3,500 metres of trains did not coincide with the times sought in QR's access applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2783">1187 QR seems to accept this, but relies on Mr Lawrence's evidence that he would do anything to accommodate NRC's trains; therefore NRC could similarly change its practices to accommodate QR's trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2784">I do not accept that it follows that NRC would have been able to accommodate QR, given the national basis of NRC's network operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2785">1188 Third, QR submitted that despite sworn evidence in his affidavit that the AR terminal was operating at almost full capacity, Mr Lawrence conceded that this evidence was badly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2786">However, the submission overstates Mr Lawrence's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2787">His answer was that it was badly wrong "on the way we were working, yes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2788">This was a reference to the fact that since September 2004, NRC introduced some operational reforms including 3-stacking of containers, apparently taking into account suggestions made by Mr Merrigan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2789">1189 In my view, Mr Lawrence's concession was nothing more than an acceptance of the proposition that he was able to extract additional capacity from the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2790">It does not establish the untruth of Mr Smith's statement in the letter of 16 July 2004 and subsequent correspondence that the AR terminal did not have the capacity to accommodate the particular services at the times sought by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2791">1190 It follows that I am not satisfied that the statements made in the relevant letters were incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2792">Moreover, I am not satisfied that the statements were made otherwise than honestly in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2793">It is true that Mr Smith was not called to give evidence, although a belated attempt was made to re-open to rely on his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2794">But it is unnecessary for me to make a finding that his evidence would not have assisted; cf Sebben v Partridge (unreported Supreme of South Australia, Lander J, 20 December 1994).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2795">In that case, Lander J was of the view that a Jones v Dunkel inference was available where a defendant was not called, an unsuccessful attempt having been made to reopen after close of the defendant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2796">1191 However here, Mr Lawrence was the source of the relevant information in the letters and in any event, QR disavowed any suggestion that the statements were made dishonestly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2797">In these circumstances, I do not consider that Mr Smith's evidence would have elucidated this particular matter: see Payne v Parker (1976) 1 NSWLR 191 at 201 per Glass JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2798">Conclusion in relation to QR's applications for access 
 
1192 I am not satisfied that NRC's consideration of QR's access applications involved anything other than a fair consideration of them on their merits, notwithstanding that NRC's responses were based on an erroneous assumption as to the overall capacity of the terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2799">I do not consider that NRC was guilty of undue delay or obfuscation, as was suggested by QR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2800">1193 Accordingly, I have come to the view that NRC's failure to grant the access applications did not amount to taking advantage of market power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2801">The relevant connection between NRC's market power and the impugned conduct was not, in my opinion, established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2802">1194 Nor am I satisfied that NRC's purpose in failing to grant the access applications was a proscribed purpose in contravention of s 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2803">Its purpose was the protection of the integrity of its national network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2804">The position is not entirely analogous with that which arose in Rural Press .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2805">Nevertheless, in my view, so long as NRC gave proper consideration to the access applications, which in my opinion it did, its purpose cannot be said to be to have been to prevent QR from engaging in competitive conduct in the relevant market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2806">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2807">CONCLUSION AND ORDERS 
 QR's cross-claim for possession 
 
1195 It follows from my rejection of PN's estoppel claim and from my rejection of the claims of misleading conduct, unconscionability and breach of s 46, that QR is entitled to an order for possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2808">There is to be a stay of the order in accordance with the undertaking given by QR to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2809">1196 It also follows that QR is entitled to an order for payment by NRC of additional rent pursuant to s 139 of the Property Law Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2810">Orders in the Proceedings 
 
1197 The orders I will make are as follows:-
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2811">That the application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2812">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2813">That QR's cross-claim under s 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2814">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2815">An order for PN to deliver up possession of the AR terminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2816">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2817">That there be a stay of order three in accordance with QR's undertaking to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2818">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2819">That QR is entitled to an order for payment of rental in accordance with s 139 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) from the date of expiration of the notice to quit dated 26 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2820">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2821">The parties are to bring in short minutes giving effect to the orders set out above and quantifying the amount payable by PN pursuant to order five.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2822">1198 It seems to me that costs must follow the event on both the application and the cross-claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2823">However, if necessary, I will hear brief argument when the short minutes are handed up.</sentence>
