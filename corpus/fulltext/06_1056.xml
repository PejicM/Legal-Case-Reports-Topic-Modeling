<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 Leafbusters Pty Ltd and Four Seasons Gutter Protection Pty Ltd are competitors in the business of selling and installing gutter protection systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">When fitted in roof gutters, such systems prevent the blocking of the gutters by leaves and other debris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mr Derek Murphy and his wife Mrs Michelle Murphy own and operate Four Seasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They were previously associated with Leafbusters as distributors and licensees of its products, first in New Zealand and later in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In seeking to recruit franchisees Four Seasons has been using documents which Leafbusters says infringe its copyright and disclose its confidential information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 Leafbusters seeks an interlocutory injunction against Four Seasons, the Murphys and an associated company GSF Holdings Australia Pty Ltd (which is to be joined as a party) restraining them from: 
 
 (a) reproducing, publishing, distributing or otherwise communicating the following documents or a substantial part thereof 
 
 (i) Four Seasons Flip Chart Manual Presentation (ii) Four Seasons Specification Manual (iii) GSF Disclosure Statement (iv) GSF Franchise Agreement 
 
 (b) representing 
 
 
 (i) that there are no judgments or penalty proceedings that could significantly affect the ownership or use of the intellectual property the subject of the Four Seasons franchise; or
 (ii) that there are no civil proceedings in Australia in relation to the Four Seasons Gutter Protection System the subject of the Four Seasons franchise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 
 (i) The Flip Chart Manual Presentation 
 
 4 This document is to be compared with the Leafbusters' Company Profile document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">There are obvious signs that substantial parts of the former have been copied from the latter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">For example, in the table of contents in the Four Seasons document one of the sections is headed, identically with the corresponding title in the Leafbusters' document, "Leafbusters the ultimate in Gutter Protection".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The author has overlooked the need to change "Leafbusters" to "Four Seasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The titles "What are you looking for in Gutter Protection" are identical in the tables in both documents, as is the title "Fair Trading Award 1997" (in fact Four Seasons was not incorporated until 2003).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 Leafbusters' asserts ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There is a presumption as to the subsistence and ownership of copyright: Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) s 126.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The proprietors of Leafbusters, Ms Thea Groom and her husband, created the documents, arguably at least on behalf of their company Leafbusters: s 35(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 (ii) The Specification Manual 
 
 6 The copying here is particularly blatant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">For example the table of contents in the Four Seasons' document and the corresponding Leafbusters' documents "Fact File and Specifications" is word for word the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Thus under the heading "Benefits" the following appears in each document: 
 
 "Benefits 
 Pine needles 
 Pest proofing 
 Rainwater collection improves 
 Estimated 20 year life 
 Potential health problems alleviated 
 Safety issues" 
 
 7 When one turns to the body of each document, under the heading "Pine needle problems" the Leafbusters document reads: 
 
 "The Leafbusters mesh will keep out 99% of pine needles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Our experience shows that some debris will stay on the mesh, and we recommend the mesh be swept twice a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A rule of thumb: what stays on the roof stays on the mesh, but the gutters are still clean as a whistle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">" 
 

The only change in the Four Seasons document is the deletion of "Leafbusters" and the insertion of "Four Seasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">(iii) GSF Disclosure Statement 
 
 8 This document is a requirement of the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory code of conduct under s 51AD of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Leafbusters' claim here is not based on copyright infringement or disclosure of confidential information but rather an alleged misleading and deceptive statement, contrary to s 52 of the Act: 
 
 (a) that there are no corporate associates, or associates that are not body corporates, of the franchisor (GSF);
 (b) that there are no current proceedings alleging contravention of trade practices law or misconduct; and
 (c) that there is not any judgment or pending proceeding that could significantly affect the ownership or use of intellectual property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 9 As to (a), I will assume that Four Seasons is a "corporate associate" of GSF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is true that in the form against the words "Corporate associates or franchisor" and "Associates of franchisor that are not body corporates" appears the word "NIL".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Nevertheless the Disclosure Statement includes the words "GSF Holdings Australia Pty Ltd utilises the name "Four Seasons Gutter Protection" and Mr Murphy is disclosed as the sole director of GSF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">An ASIC search shows that GSF was registered on 13 April 2004 and that as at 13 July 2006 it has the status "Strike-off action in progress".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">However, I was not informed that GSF has by now been struck off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Nothing more seems to be made of this aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Also the names of Four Seasons (the company) and Mr Murphy are referred to in a statement about the litigation to which I shall shortly refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Any inaccuracy in these representations is minor and technical and would not warrant an injunction restraining use of the whole document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 As to (b), the document includes the following statement: 
 
 " Note : The franchisor notes that in 2004 Four Seasons Gutter Protection Pty Ltd, Derek Murphy and Michelle Murphy instituted defamation proceedings against Leafbusters Pty Ltd and Theofani Tsioris in the Victorian division of the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Also in 2004, Leafbusters later instituted Federal Court proceedings against Four Seasons Gutter Protection Pty Ltd, Derek Murphy and Michelle Murphy and their franchisees and sales consultants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">These proceedings are ongoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The judgments of the Court can be viewed by typing in Four Seasons on www.federalcourt.gov.au under the 'Search Judgments' option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">" 
 

Counsel for Leafbusters submitted that this did not "disclose the nature of the proceedings by Leafbusters, which include allegations of contravention of trade practices law and misconduct".</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">There is no substance in this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">As a matter of common sense there has been adequate disclosure of the current litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">There has been no attempt to hide behind the fact that at the time the document was issued GSF was not a party to the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 11 As to (c), the prescribed form only requires disclosure as to any judgment etc that could affect "the intellectual property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In a previous answer "the relevant intellectual property" has been described as the words "Four Seasons Gutter Protection" and logo and patents pending as to the Four Seasons mesh in respect of which Four Seasons holds a licence from the manufacturer Tapex Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">There is, as far as the evidence discloses, no judgment or pending proceeding that could affect the intellectual property of Four Seasons as so defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As I have said, the present litigation has been adequately disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">12 There is not a serious issue to be tried in respect of the GSF Disclosure Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 (iv) GSF Franchise Agreement 
 
 13 The GSF Franchise Agreement is a straight, word for word copy of a complex 43 page legal agreement used by Leafbusters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In the non-competition covenant the name of GSF appears but with an ACN that is Leafbusters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">14 The Leafbusters agreement was prepared by Ebsworth and Ebsworth in about October 1999 for the Leafbusters' parties at a cost of approximately $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">15 If Ebsworth and Ebsworth is the owner of the copyright for the purposes of an interlocutory injunction there is sufficient material to infer that arguably Leafbusters have an implied licence to sue for infringement on that firm's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In any event, I shall direct that notice be given of the injunction so that Ebsworth and Ebsworth may either seek to be joined as a party or formally authorise Leafbusters to sue on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 Misleading and deceptive representations 
 
 16 The alleged misrepresentations (see [3](b) above) have already been considered in connection with the GSF Disclosure Statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I find that they do not raise a serious issue to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 Serious issue to be tried 
 
 17 I conclude there is a serious issue to be tried for infringement of copyright in relation to the documents in [3] (a)(i), (ii) and (iv) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It is not necessary to consider the claim for disclosure of confidential information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 Balance of convenience 
 
 18 Four Seasons' use of the allegedly infringing documents will give it an advantage and a headstart compared with the time and expense that would be taken to develop such documents from scratch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There must be a finite number of franchises which can be sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As the network of Four Seasons franchises and its market share increases, there will be a consequent increase in the value of the franchise and its commercial attraction to prospective franchisees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It would be problematic, and expensive, to quantify the loss suffered by Leafbusters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">19 Four Seasons did not put on any evidence as to uncompensable (or indeed any) hardship they might suffer were an injunction to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In substance the only discretionary argument put was that of laches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 Four Seasons' solicitor Dr Charles Birch deposed that by letter dated 13 October 2005 Leafbusters' solicitors made the same assertions in relation to Four Seasons' "2005 Four Seasons Franchise Opportunity Folder" which contained very similar documents to those in the 2006 version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">21 Dr Birch said in a letter dated 14 October 2005 that he would seek a copy of the Four Seasons Specifications Book from his clients and compare it with that of Leafbusters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(There was also correspondence at this time about the Disclosure Statement, but as this will not be the subject of injunctive relief no more need be said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">) 22 By a letter dated 3 November 2005 Dr Birch forwarded a copy of the Four Seasons Specification Book to Leafbusters' solicitors, but it is said they made no complaint until the service of the present notice of motion on 13 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It appears the 2006 Four Seasons Franchise Opportunity Folder came into possession of Leafbusters in late May/early June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">23 Dr Birch's forwarding of the Four Seasons Specification Book, in contrast to his forwarding of the Disclosure Statement on 2 November 2005, was not subject to a stipulation that Leafbusters' solicitors not release it to this client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">24 Nevertheless, while delay is a relevant factor for the exercise of a discretion it is not conclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I take into account also: 
 
 &#8226; the blatancy of Four Seasons copying;
 &#8226; the lack of any assertion of hardship by this application being brought now rather than last November; and
 &#8226; the fact that at an earlier hearing in this litigation on 17 September 2004 counsel for Four Seasons stated that his clients "immediately agree to cease using any copyright material of Leafbusters that could be accurately identified".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 Orders 
 
 25 There will be an order for an interlocutory injunction in the terms indicated above 26 There will be an order that the costs be reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Although Leafbusters complain, with some justification of Four Seasons' departures from its earlier assurances, the fact remains that this is an interlocutory hearing and final rights have not been determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">


 I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Associate:
