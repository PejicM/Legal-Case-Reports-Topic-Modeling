1 This is an application by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority ("the Authority") to review the decisions of the first respondent ("the AAT") dated 29 May 2008 purportedly made pursuant to s 41(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act") to:
 
 
 (1) stay the operation and implementation of the applicant's removal of certain active constituents from the Record of Approved Active Constituents;
 
 (2) stay the operation and implementation of the applicant's removal of certain chemical products from the Register of Chemical Products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
2 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code (the Code), scheduled to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth) ("the Act"), provides for the approval of active constituents of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and for the registration of those chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 The Authority is established under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Its functions include, where appropriate, the granting of applications for approval of "active constituents" and for the registration of "chemical products".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These expressions are defined in s 3 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Broadly, an active constituent forms part of a chemical product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Sections 17 and 18 respectively require the Authority to keep a Record of Approved Active Constituents for Chemical Products ("the Record") and a Register of Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The latter is, by virtue of s 3 , referred to in the Act as the Register of Chemical Products ("the Register").</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 Decisions to approve and register made under s 19(1) and s 20(1) respectively are given effect by entering "relevant particulars" together with any conditions of approval in the Record and Register under s 19(2) and s 20(2) respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">"Relevant particulars" include particulars prescribed by regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An approval or a registration must include, as part of the prescribed particulars of each active constituent and each chemical product required to be entered in the Record and the Register, the name of each manufacturer and the address of each site of manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Evergreen Nurture Agrochemicals Ltd (Evergreen) was included in the Record and Register as a manufacturer of certain active constituents and chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Evergreen is a fictitious name admittedly provided by Imtrade to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The address provided was also incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Imtrade did this because it did not want this information to be made available to its competitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It did not think that the information was relevant to the decision of the Authority whether or not to approve active constituents or to register chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The primary issue is whether this deliberate misrepresentation constitutes fraud on the Authority such as to vitiate each of the approvals and registrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The current proceedings relate to the approval of nine active constituents and the registration of 52 chemical products in the name of the second respondent (Imtrade).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">These active constituents and chemical products are set out as attachments to a letter of the Authority to the solicitors for Imtrade, dated 21 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is no dispute about the identification of the relevant constituents and products, or that Evergreen is recorded as a manufacturer of each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 The matter comes before this Court following action by the Authority to treat the relevant approvals and registrations as invalid and to remove them from the Record and Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Forty-seven of the registrations were validly registered initially but were subject to variation under the Code by adding Evergreen in each case as a formulator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is common ground that this is another name for a manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The variations were said to have been achieved by fraud and therefore it is contended by the Authority that those registrations as varied are also invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Authority took this action on the basis of its view that the fraud of Imtrade vitiated each of the approvals and registrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Imtrade sought to characterise this action as a decision by the Authority under Division 5 of Part 2, of the Code to cancel the several approvals and registrations reviewable in the AAT under s 167(1)(f) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">7 The Authority contends that it did not cancel or even purport to cancel the approvals and registrations under the provisions of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There is no decision, it says, for review by the AAT, and its jurisdiction is not attracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">RELIEF SOUGHT 
 
8 The applicant seeks an order quashing the decision of the AAT pursuant to s 16(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act "), and a declaration that the AAT had no jurisdiction to issue the stay orders so issued pursuant to s 16(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 The applicant also seeks to enliven the original jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) by seeking a writ of prohibition against the AAT restraining the AAT from proceeding to review the removal of the entries in question from the Record and Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 Founded on that original jurisdiction, the applicant also seeks declarations pursuant to s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in the Court's accrued jurisdiction: Queensland Medical Laboratory v Blewett (1988) 84 ALR 615 at 637 per Gummow J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Those declarations are to the effect that the approval of the active constituents and registration of the chemical products are of no legal effect because they were affected, procured, or induced by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 Further, the applicant seeks a writ of certiorari against the AAT, quashing its decision to issue the stay orders commensurate with the ancillary or accrued jurisdiction of the Court to issue a writ of prohibition sought under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act : Klewer v Dutch [2000] FCA 509 ; (2000) 99 FCR 217 at 230 [53] - [54] per Hill J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
12 The Code is part of a legislative scheme including the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth), the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth), and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">13 The second reading speech in respect of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill contained the following: 
 Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and related matters will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">14 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 states that it is an Act " to make provision for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related matters... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" This Act, and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 , each contain a preamble recognising, relevantly the following:
 
 
 (a) that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and 
 
 (b) that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products at the present time will not impair the prospects of future generations; and 
 
 (c) that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and 
 
 (d) that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; ...
 
 

15 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 establishes the Authority and confers functions on it, including those set out in s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">16 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 applies the Code, as in force for the time being, as a law for the government of participating Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">17 The object of the Code is set out in s 1: 
 The object of this Code is to make provision for and in relation to: 
 
 (a) the evaluation, approval, and control of the supply, of active constituents for proposed or existing agricultural chemical products or veterinary chemical products; and 
 
 (b) the evaluation, registration, and control of the manufacture and supply, of agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 

18 In relation to the approval of active constituents and the registration of chemical products, s 3 defines the term relevant particulars relevantly as follows: 
 relevant particulars means: 
 
 (a) in relation to the approval of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product --- the distinguishing number, instructions for use and other particulars that are required by paragraph 19(2)(a) to be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents; and 
 (b) in relation to the registration of a chemical product --- the distinguishing number and other particulars that are required by paragraph 20(2)(a) to be entered in the Register of Chemical Products; ...
 (Emphasis added) 
 
 
The relevant particulars also include relevantly "particulars of a variation of relevant particulars that is made under para 29(1)(h) ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I will refer to these later in the context of the purported variations to the relevant particulars in respect of the 47 valid registrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">19 Applications for approval of an active constituent and for registration of a chemical product are, by s 10 to be made to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Section 11 provides for how such applications are made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">20 By s 19(2)(a) , approval of an active constituent takes place by the Authority entering in the Record of Approved Active Constituents the relevant particulars, which include "any other particulars that are prescribed by the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">" Similarly by s 20(2)(a) , registration of chemical product takes place by the Authority entering in the Register of Chemical Products the relevant particulars, including those prescribed by the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">21 Any person may inspect and obtain a copy of or extract from any part of the Record [s 17(4) and (5)] and Register [s 18(4) and (5)] that does not contain confidential commercial information which is defined under s 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Section 3(c)(ii) may well result in the information prescribed under Reg 15 and Reg 16 being confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">22 Regulation 15 and 16 of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations 1995 provide as follows: 
 Reg 15 Particulars of approved active constituents to be recorded (1) Subject to subregulation (2), for the purposes of subsection 19 (2) of the Code, the following particulars must be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents in relation to the approval of an active constituent: (a) if a name is given to the active constituent by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -- that name; (b) if no name is given to the active constituent by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -- the name given to the active constituent in an order, publication or approval referred to in regulation 42 that specifies the standard for the active constituent for the purposes of that regulation; (c) the common name for the active constituent proposed by the applicant and accepted by the APVMA; (d) the composition and purity of the active constituent; (e) the name of the manufacturer of the active constituent; (f) the address of each site at which the active constituent is manufactured by the manufacturer; (g) the name and business address of the applicant; (h) the date of entry of these particulars in the Record of Approved Active Constituents; (j) the date (if any) on which the approval ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">(Emphasis added) (2) In relation to an active constituent approved in accordance with section 14A of the Code, the particulars mentioned in paragraphs (1) (c) to (j) need be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents only if those particulars are readily available to the APVMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Reg 16 Particulars of registered chemical products to be recorded For the purposes of subsection 20(2) of the Code (which deals with registration of a chemical product), the following particulars must be entered in the Register of Chemical Products in relation to the registration of a chemical product: 
 
 (a) the distinguishing name of the chemical product proposed by the applicant and accepted by the APVMA; 
 (b) the constituents of the chemical product; 
 (c) the concentration of each constituent of the chemical product; 
 (d) if possible, the composition and purity of each active constituent of the chemical product; 
 (e) the name and business address of the applicant; 
 (f) the name of each State or Territory in respect of which the chemical product is registered; 
 (g) the name of each manufacturer of the chemical product ; 
 (h) the address of each site at which the chemical product is manufactured by the manufacturer ; 
 (j) the date of entry of these particulars in the Register of Chemical Products; 
 (k) the date on which the registration ends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">(Emphasis added) 
 
 
23 The date of approval of an active constituent, and the date of registration of a chemical product, is the date on which the relevant particulars are entered in the Record or Register: s 22(1) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">If any of the relevant particulars are varied, then, the date of the approval or the registration, as varied, is the date on which particulars of the variations are entered in the Record or Register: s 22(2) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">24 By s 14(1) of the Code, the Authority must grant an application for approval or registration made under s 10 if it is satisfied of all the matters referred to in s 14(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">If the Authority is not satisfied of all those matters, then, under s 14(2) it must refuse an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Those matters include the Authority being satisfied that: 
 &#8226; the applicant has complied with s 11(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This section requires that the application must be in writing and contain or be accompanied by any information that the Authority requires; &#8226; the applicant has provided for analysis, a sample of each active constituent or each active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product required by the Authority (s 157(1)(a)); &#8226; the applicant has provided for analysis, if the application relates to a chemical product, a sample of any constituent of the product or a sample of the product or both required by the Authority (s 157(1)(b)); &#8226; the applicant has paid the cost of the analysis to the Authority (s 157(3)); &#8226; the applicant has provided information to the Authority required by it relevant to an application relating to an active constituent or chemical product (s 159(1)(a) and (e)); &#8226; the applicant has carried out research for the Authority of published literature for information about the active constituent or the chemical product or any of its constituents and provided a report to the Authority on the results of the search (s 159(1)(f)); &#8226; that any requirement prescribed in the regulations in relation to the active constituent or chemical product has been complied with; &#8226; that the use of the active constituent or chemical product would not be an undue hazard to the safety of people; would not be likely to have an effect that is harmful or human beings or an unintended effect that is harmful to animals, plants or things or to the environment; &#8226; the use of the chemical product, in accordance with the instructions of use approved by the APVMA, would be effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Section 14(4), (5) and (6) together impose very detailed obligations on the Authority as to how it is to satisfy itself as to whether or not the active constituents or chemical products would be an undue hazard or have an effect that is harmful to human beings or would be effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">This is to give practical effect to the 'overriding criteria' mentioned in the second reading speech as well as what is found in the preambles, to which I have referred: protection of the health and safety of human beings and animals and the environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">25 Division 3 provides for applications to vary relevant particulars of approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In summary, an interested person in relation to the constituent or product may apply to the Authority for variation of the relevant particulars: s 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Again, the Authority must grant the application if satisfied of specified matters: s 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Those matters include that the application contain or be accompanied by the information that the Authority requires: s 29 and s 28(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There follows a similar process to that for the initial approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">26 Division 5 provides for suspension or cancellation of approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In summary, the division prescribes the circumstances in which the Authority may suspend or cancel, as well as the procedure to be followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">This includes a requirement to give notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">27 Division 6 provides for the duration and renewal of approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">An approval continues in force unless cancelled: s 47(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The registration of a chemical product, however, ends at the end of 30 June next following the day on which the registration was granted or renewed, or last renewed, as the case may be: s 47(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The interested person may apply for renewal of the registration of a chemical product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The Code provides for late application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The discretion of the Authority in acting on an application for renewal is limited: see s 49(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">28 Section 145 creates an offence for a person, in specified circumstances, to give information or produce a document to the Authority that the person knows to be false or misleading in a material particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">By s 161 it is an offence for an interested person who becomes aware of any relevant information in relation to a constituent or in relation to a product or of any of its constituents, to not give that information to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">By sub-section (2), relevant information includes any information that contradicts any information given to the Authority under the Code, or would have had to be given to the Authority in connection with the application for the approval, registration, listed registration or permit if the applicant had been aware of the information when the application was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">CONSIDERATION 
 
29 The Authority submits that the relevant approvals and registrations, including the varied registrations were affected, procured or induced by the fraud of Imtrade in providing the fictitious name and address of Evergreen as manufacturer in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It seeks declarations to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">30 The Authority submits that the approval of each active constituent by the entry pursuant to s 19(2)(a) of the Code in the Record of the relevant particulars was in law not an approval and could be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The same is said of the registrations and the variations to the relevant particulars of registrations under s 20(2)(a) and s 29(1)(h)(i) respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">This is so, it says, because subject to limited exceptions, a person will not be permitted to keep an advantage obtained by fraud: an administrative decision procured by fraud may be ignored as an invalid decision and of no effect at law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">This is what the Authority has purported to do here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It has manifested its view that it may ignore the approvals in the Record and the registrations in the Register, which are each in electronic form, by deleting each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">They no longer appear in the Record or the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It has not purported, as I have said, to cancel the approvals and registrations under the provisions of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Authority submits that the decision of the Full Court in Leung v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (1997) 79 FCR 400 is warrant for their actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">31 The issue in Leung was whether the Minister for Immigration could, absent an express statutory power to do so, revoke the grant of a certificate of Australian citizenship where the applicants had misled his delegate about their factual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The appellants sought a certificate of Australian Citizenship, which involved two steps: the Minister must grant the Certificate and the applicant must make the prescribed pledge of commitment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The appellants made representations of fact, asserting that during their time spent overseas they were engaged in activities beneficial to the interests of Australia, namely the promotion and export of Australian goods (rough opals and fresh produce to Hong Kong).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">On the basis of these representations the Minister exercised his discretion under s 13(1) of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (Cth) in favour of the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In fact, the applicant and his wife had both been practicing as medical professionals in Hong Kong for the better part of the time they initially claimed to have been promoting Australian exports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Certificates were granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">However, before the appellants made their pledges of commitment, it was discovered that the representations of fact were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Minister's delegate then decided to 'revoke' the decision to grant the Certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">32 The Court was divided in its reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The majority (Finkelstein J and Beaumont J concurring) concluded that as the decision to grant the certificate was procured by fraud it was invalid and could be ignored without any formal process of revocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It was unnecessary, the majority concluded, to rely upon any express or implied power of revocation under the statute to proceed as it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">33 Heerey J resolved the appeal on the basis of an implied statutory power to revoke a certificate of citizenship where a statutory criterion for the issue of the certificate did not in fact exist although such a power terminated once the pledge of commitment had been made because a person could not be deprived of citizenship other than by virtue of s 21 of the Citizenship Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">His Honour said:
 "there is no general rule or principle of administrative law that decisions based upon a wrong factual basis may be revoked by the decision-maker --- still less that such decisions do not need to be revoked and may simply be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The supposed general rule would necessarily extend indefinitely in time and to factual errors for which persons affected by the decision were in no way responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Such persons might have arranged their own affairs on the basis of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">34 Finkelstein J however expressed the opinion that: 
 ... the true principle is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">To ignore an invalid decision is not to revoke it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is merely to recognise that that which purports to be a decision does not have that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">To decide the matter again is not a reconsideration of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It is in fact the original exercise of the power to make the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Nor is there any need to find either an express or an implicit power of reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Those doctrines, to the extent that they are applicable to administrative decision-making, only apply to validly made administrative decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">35 There has been much controversy as to whether invalid administrative decisions may simply be ignored by the decision-maker without judicial determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The debate between the absolute and relative invalidity schools of thought is far from resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There is a very useful discussion of these in a paper presented by Robert Orr and Robyn Briese at an AIAL Forum in October 2002: Don't Think Twice?</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Can Administrative Decision Making Change Their Mind?</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Absolute invalidity means that a decision-maker, and those affected by the invalid decision may just ignore it as if it had never been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">There is no requirement for judicial review to achieve this result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It does not constitute a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Support for it is found in Ouslow v R [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69 per McHugh J and by some commentators: Sykes, Lanham, Tracey and Esser, General Principles of Administrative Law (4 th ed, Butterworths, 1997) at 447 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">
 
36 The relative invalidity school argues that invalidity is required to be established by judicial, not administrative, determination and any decision tainted by jurisdictional error is valid and effective in law until such a determination is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Examples are to be found in Forbes v New South Wales Trotting Club Ltd [1979] HCA 27 ; (1979) 143 CLR 242 at 277 per Aikin J; Ousley v R per Gummow J at 130-131; R v Balfour; ex parte Parkes Rural Distributors Pty Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 26 at 33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It too has support amongst commentators: M Taggart, "Rival Theories of Invalidity" in M Taggart (ed), Judicial Review of Administrative Action in the 1980s --- Problems and Prospects (Oxford University Press and the Legal Research Foundation Inc, 1988) at p 70; Aronson and Dyer in Judicial Review of Administrative Action (2 nd ed, LBC, 2000) conclude on this issue at p 499: 
 The truth is that there is no such thing as a complete nullity; it always takes a court decision to say so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Kirby J cites other strong support both judicial and from legal commentators in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at [103]-[104].</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">37 The concept of absolute invalidity has been rejected by the High Court, at least in the context of judgments and orders of federal courts declared by legislation to be "superior courts" of record: Bhardwaj per Kirby J at [108]; Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33 ; (2000) 202 CLR 629 at 660 [77] ; Re Macks; Ex parte Saint [2000] HCA 62 ; (2000) 204 CLR 158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
38 Some cases advocate a position somewhere between the two poles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">A J Burr Ltd v Blenheim Borough Council [1980] 2 NZLR 1 at 4 is an example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">There, Cooke J said that other than in cases which involve "flagrant invalidity" an administrative decision is generally to be taken to be operative until set aside by judicial determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">39 The question of invalidity and its consequences was considered by the High Court in Bhardwaj.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The respondent, whose student visa was cancelled by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs applied to the Immigration Review Tribunal for a review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The Tribunal proposed to deal with the matter on 15 September 1998, and invited the respondent to attend a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Late in the afternoon of 14 September 1998 the Tribunal received, from the respondent's agent, a letter stating that the respondent was ill and would be unable to attend the next day, and requesting an adjournment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">By an administrative oversight, the letter did not come to the attention of the member of the Tribunal to whom the matter had been assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Tribunal dealt with the matter on 15 and 16 September, adversely to the respondent, and notified the respondent and his agent on 17 September.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The reason given for the Tribunal's decision was that the respondent had not provided any information which suggested that the cancellation of his visa was unfair or inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">When the respondent's agent was informed of the decision, the attention of the Tribunal member was drawn to the letter of 14 September.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">A new hearing date was arranged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Tribunal heard the respondent's explanation of the conduct which had resulted in the cancellation of his visa, accepted the explanation, and, on 22 October 1998, revoked the cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The issue in the appeal concerned the capacity of the Tribunal to proceed as it did thereby correcting its own error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The Minister contended that the power of the Tribunal to review the delegate's decision was spent after it made the decision in September.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">40 Hayne J attached significance to whether the earlier decision would be set aside by the Federal Court or the High Court under s 75(v) of the Constitution at [147], concluding that where a decision would be set aside the power has not been exercised: [142], [155], [157].</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It might seem that the practical application of such a test by a decision-maker raises its own self-evident difficulties, absent clear authority on all fours, with the circumstances of the case in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">However I do not take his Honour to have been referring to circumstances other than where there is a clear error involved as in his citation at [152] of Dixon J in Posner v Collector for Inter-State Destitute Persons (Vict) (1946) 74 CLR 461 at 483 suggests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">41 How is invalidity to be determined?</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">In the present case, alleged fraud amounting to jurisdictional error is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However the facts other than in respect to the variation of relevant particulars in respect of 47 existing valid registrations are in contest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Accordingly, it cannot be assumed that a Court would set aside the decisions of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Even in respect to the variations to the particulars, I do not think that it could be assumed that the provision of false particulars would lead a Court to declare the underlying valid registrations as thereby invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Posited in that way, it might be said that the necessary precondition to the right to ignore a decision, earlier made, has not been established and necessarily requires judicial determination of both fact and law on the question of validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">42 In Leung the question of fact and law as to whether Mr and Mrs Leung were entitled to the favourable exercise of the discretion under s 13(4)(b)(i) of the Citizenship Act was disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The dispute involved questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Minister had not purported to rely upon the common law doctrine of vitiation by fraud but rather upon s 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) as the source of power to revoke the certificate of citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The AAT resolved the factual dispute in favour of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Finkelstein J observed that no point had been taken that the AAT lacked jurisdiction and proceeded on the basis that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Importantly however, when the matter was before the Full Court the factual controversy had been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It was not in dispute by then that the decision to grant the certificate of citizenship had been procured by misrepresentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The question was whether in those circumstances the decision to grant the certificate as a result of proven misrepresentation was thereby vitiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">43 Likewise, the error in Bhardwaj might be characterised as "flagrantly invalid" to use the language of Cooke J in Blenheim .</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In their joint judgment, Gaudron and Gummow JJ referred to the decision as one which "clearly involved a failure to exercise jurisdiction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Hayne J said that it was not seriously disputed in the Courts below or in the High Court that due to an oversight, the Tribunal had not given the respondent the opportunity to appear and give evidence and present arguments which s 360(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) required he be given before the Tribunal made the September decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">This was the jurisdictional error involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">44 Invalidity, in a particular case, may be demonstrated by consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">In Comptroller General of Customs v Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 518 ; (1991) 103 ALR 661 the Full Court concluded that an administrative order made under the provisions of Pt XVa of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) could be revoked by agreement of the parties without the necessity for a judicial determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">45 The concept of invalidity involves questions of mixed fact and law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There may be evidentiary considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In Leung, Finkelstein J, drawing on observations by Lord Hoffman in R v Wicks [1997] UKHL 21 ; [1998] AC 92 at 115, said at 413: 
 In other words the presumption of the validity of an administrative decision, to the extent that the presumption is to be made in a particular case, is no more than a rule of evidence pursuant to which a certain assumption will be made by a judge unless there is evidence which contradicts that assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">As Kirby J said in Ousley at 1594 the presumption is merely a tool in the process of reasoning to a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">See also Wigmore on Evidence (1981) vol 9, par 2491.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">46 In Bhardwaj Hayne J in the same vein said: 
 If there is no challenge to the validity of an administrative act or decision, whether directly by proceedings for judicial review or collaterally in some other proceeding in which its validity is raised incidentally, the act or decision may be presumed to be valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">But again, that is a presumption which operates, chiefly, in circumstances where there is no challenge to the legal effect of what has been done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Where there is a challenge, the presumption may serve only to identify and emphasise the need for proof of some invalidating feature before a conclusion of invalidity may be reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It is not a presumption which may be understood as affording all administrative acts and decisions validity and binding effect until they are set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">47 Whether an administrative decision ought be presumed to be valid until set aside by a court will depend upon the particular case having regard always to the particular legislation under which the decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">48 In my opinion, the presumption in this case cannot be displaced, merely at the instance of the Authority, in the face of factual questions, the resolution of which is necessary before determining the legal validity or otherwise of the several decisions to approve and to register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It is a fact that incorrect information was given to the Authority by Imtrade concerning the name and address of the manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Evergreen was a fictitious name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The factual question whether this affected induced or procured the several decisions is disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Authority cannot determine that question for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">49 There is a further reason why curial disposition is necessary in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The presumption of validity is of particular importance here because the legislation involves a system of approvals and registration affecting innocent third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Approvals and registrations require by s 52(1) and (2) respectively to be published by the Authority, at least in the Gazette.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The position under s 53 in respect to variations and s 55 in respect to suspensions or cancellations is the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Approval and registration confers important rights upon third parties such as suppliers and purchasers of chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">It also protects them against criminal liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">For example, supply and possession with the intent to supply unapproved active constituents and unregistered chemical products are offences under the Code: ss 74 - 78 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Some offences are indictable offences: s 170 and may involve imprisonment: ss 162 , 163 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Conviction for offences under the Code may involve forfeiture of property: s 150.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Part 7A of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 deals with importation, manufacture and export of chemicals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Under Part 7A , it is an offence to import into Australia an active constituent that has not been approved or a chemical product that is not registered: s 69B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The removal of the approvals and registrations by merely deleting these electronically has the very real potential to expose innocent third parties to prosecution as well as financial loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The system of recorded approvals and registrations enables third parties to organise their affairs accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">50 Compliance with the Code may also be the subject of injunctions, as well as action involving the execution of search warrants with Inspectors having powers of entry and seizure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">51 Furthermore, Part 2 , Div 5 of the Code empowers the Authority in certain circumstances to suspend or cancel approvals and registrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Upon cancellation, the Authority must give written notice to interested and approved persons as defined in s 3 and to any other person it believes notice should be given: s 45A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">After such notice, that person is taken to have been issued with a permit to "possess, have custody of, use or otherwise deal" with the constituent or product for a certain period of time: s 45A(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">A penalty applies for not acting in accordance with the instructions contained in the notice: s 45A(6), ss 74 - 78 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Accordingly, s 45A(5) protects, for a period of time, third parties affected by the cancellation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That protection is not available to them in the circumstances which presently exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The Authority issued a recall notice to Imtrade under s 101 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I will consider this in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It is relevant in the present context to note that under Clause 2 of the Notice, which sets out various definitions, there is included the word "Permit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">It is stated to mean a permit under Part 7 of the "Agvet Codes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">There is however no operative clause in the Notice concerning permits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">A consideration of Part 7 of the Code immediately demonstrates that its provisions are not apt to the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">52 The observations of Hayne J at [143] and Kirby J at [122] in Bhardwaj are relevant to these third party considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">53 In my opinion, it is for this Court to decide the legal question involving as it does a preliminary factual enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Indeed, the Authority seeks declarations from this Court that each approval and each registration was of no legal effect because each was affected, procured or induced by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I will now consider those questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">54 It is fundamental to the Authority's case that invalidity be established in respect of each approval and registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is necessary to establish that the decisions to approve and to register were actually induced or affected by fraud on the balance of probabilities and having due regard to Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">This is sometimes referred to as operative fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is not enough to prove a "real suspicion" or a "real possibility": Wati v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 71 FCR 103 at 112-113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Wati on this point was referred to with apparent approval by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 237 ALR 64 at [25] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The alleged fraud must affect the decision-making process: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX [2008] FCAFC 171 ; (2008) 245 ALR 501 at [33] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">55 French J, at first instance , in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 at [74] said: 
 The finding of fraud should have specified, in one place in the reasons what was said that was fraudulent, how it was fraudulent and how it was acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This statement was approved by the High Court in that case on appeal: SZFDE at [41].</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">56 The Authority, as part of its case on the issue of fraud, did not seek to prove what information it actually had received and relied upon in making its several decisions to approve and register under ss 19(1) ; 20(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">57 Rather, senior counsel for the Authority referring to the statement of French J said: 
 We know what was the fraud, we know how it was effected and how it was acted on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It was acted on by the making of the registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The fact that it was operative ... flows from the legislation that it was operative ... 
58 Accordingly, the case for the Authority is that the provision of the fictitious name and address of Evergreen being particulars prescribed under Regulations 15 and 16 necessarily leads, as a matter of inference, to the conclusion that each approval and registration was procured or induced by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 
59 Section 11(1)(a) and (b) together provide in effect that an application to the Authority under s 10 for approval of an active constituent or for registration of a chemical product must be made in writing in or to the effect of the approved form and contain, or be accompanied by, any information that the Authority requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">There is no evidence as to whether the various applications were made in or to the effect of the approved form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">No reliance was placed upon the wording of the approved form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It was not referred to in submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 
60 It is by no means clear just what information for the purposes of s 11(1)(b) the Authority requires generally or required particularly in this case in relation to the grant of the various applications for approval of active constituents and for registration of chemical products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">61 Approval is effected under s 19(2)(a) by entering in the Record of Approved Action Constituents amongst other things the particulars prescribed by Regulation 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">However such approval is effected only after the Authority decides to approve an active constituent: s 19(1) of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">62 A decision under Division 2 of Part 2 to refuse an application for approval of an active constituent or to register a chemical product is reviewable under s 167(1)(a) and a decision to approve either of these applications is reviewable under s 167(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">There is no provision to review the act of recording prescribed particulars in the Record or the Register which gives effect to those decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">63 There is no evidence as to what information the Authority had before it in arriving at its several decisions to approve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Even if it had the information prescribed by Regulation 15 this does not mean it was information required for the purposes of s 11(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">64 There is no evidence as to when the Authority asked for information concerning the name and address of the manufacturer in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">There is no evidence that Imtrade or its agents officers or employees was aware that such information was relevant to their application or putting it another way, that the information was material to the Authority's decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No reason has been proffered as to why this information was to be regarded as significant other than for the purpose of complying with Regs 15 and 16 which concern events after the relevant decisions were made: cf Sharples v O'Shea (unreported Supreme Court of Queensland, Atkinson J, 18 August 1999 at [66].</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">65 The position in respect to the registration of chemical products is to the same effect: registration under s 20(2) is effected by the entry in the Register, amongst other things, of the particulars prescribed by Regulation 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">However this occurs only after the Authority decides to register under s 20(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">66 It is no answer for Mr Suter to say in his affidavit sworn on 5 June 2008 at [14]:
 Unless the APVMA was satisfied that the second respondent had provided any information that the APVMA required, under section 14 of the Agvet Code, it could not grant the application for approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">If the second respondent at the time it made its applications for approval of the active constituents and registration of chemical products had told the APVMA in its applications that the information concerning the identity of the manufacturer and site of manufacture to be entered into the Record and the Register respectively was false, or if the APVMA had been aware of the falsity of those particulars, the APVMA would not have granted those applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">67 That assertion is to beg the question as to what information was required under s 11(1)(b) for the purposes of making decisions under s 19(1) and s 20(1) as distinct from what was required in giving effect to those decisions under s 19(2) and s 20(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Regulations 15 and 16 are directed not to s 19(1) and s 20(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The regulations are expressed to be "for the purposes of" subsection s 19(2) and s 20(2) of the Code, respectively and to be "in relation to" the approval of an active constituent and the registration of a chemical product, respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The prescribed particulars are accordingly not for the purposes of either s 19(1) or s 20(1) nor are they required in relation to a decision to approve or a decision to register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">68 Applications to vary relevant particulars and the mode of such applications are provided for in ss 27 and 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">These are to the same effect, mutatis mutandis as applications under ss 10 and 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The submissions of the Authority in respect to the 47 variations of registration are also to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">69 Fraud requires to be strictly articulated and proved: Wentworth v Rogers (No 5) (1986) 6 NSWLR 534 at 538D per Kirby P. A finding of fraud is not to be made lightly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">I am not persuaded that the misinformation provided, at some point, by Imtrade to the Authority led to operative fraud, namely, that the Authority was actually induced by the provision of that information to make the decisions to approve and to register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">I am not prepared to infer such fraud merely because Regs 15 and 16 require particulars of the name and address of the manufacturer to be recorded and registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">There are provisions in the Code which lend support to the conclusion that such information is not operative in the making of those decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">70 First, the provision of such particulars is not immediately referable to the objects of the Act or Code which as I have indicated centre upon concerns of safety and health of individuals, animals and the environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The Authority points to paragraph (d) of the preamble to the Code which concerns the creation of a regulatory system that is open and accountable and which gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of chemical and veterinary products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The particulars in question do not, I think, touch on that object.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">They are particulars which I earlier suggested may well be maintained in the confidential part of each of the Record and Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Certainly, according to Mr James Suter who is acting CEO of the Authority, in his affidavit in support of the application sworn on 5 June 2008 at [9], the identity of the manufacturer and address of the site at which chemical products are manufactured are kept in the confidential part of the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">71 Second, incorrectly recorded or registered relevant particulars may be corrected in the Record and Register by the Authority under the provisions of s 26 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Furthermore, Part 2, Div 5 of the Code provides for suspension and cancellation of approval or registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Under s 40(1), it is only if the relevant particulars or conditions for approval or registration cannot be varied to comply with the prescribed requirements that the approval or registration may be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The legislature has prescribed this approach for cases where the prescribed requirements are not complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">72 Third, although under s 145 the provision of false information to the Authority for the purposes of, or in connection with, the consideration by the Authority, in the course of the performance of any of its functions or the exercise of any of its powers under this Code is an offence, it is not a ground of cancellation under s 41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">That section provides for cancellation or suspension of approvals and registrations where the continued use of the active constituent or chemical product may be an undue hazard to the safety of people exposed to it, or which may be likely to have an effect that is harmful to human beings or may be likely to have an unintended effect that is harmful to animals plants or things or to the environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">73 The matters taken together tend against a view that the name and address of a manufacturer is information which the Authority requires under s 11(1)(b) of the Code to which it must be satisfied by reason of s 14(1) and (3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">74 It follows that I am not prepared to find that the several approvals and registrations were affected, procured or induced by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The removal of these by the Authority from the Record and the Register was in each case unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">75 As I foreshadowed, the position is different concerning the variation of relevant particulars to 47 of the existing valid registrations by adding the name Evergreen and its address as an additional manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It is not to the point that the intention of Imtrade was not to obtain these variations by misrepresentation but rather was to protect their confidential commercial information from competitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Ironically, this is something for which the Code expressly caters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">It is not disputed by Imtrade that these applications under s 27 contained the fictitious name and address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">There can be no doubt that, in those respects, the Authority was misled in an operative sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The false information was the very subject matter of each of the variation applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The decision to vary the prescribed particulars was accordingly induced by this misrepresentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">However as these variations were of no effect ab initio they cannot, in my opinion, operate to render the pre-existing registrations invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">76 Accordingly, other than in relation to the applications for variation of relevant particulars, the declarations sought should be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The appropriate declaration in my opinion, in relation to the purported variations is that the variations in each case are of no legal effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">However the declarations are limited to that extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The 47 valid registrations to which they relate are unaffected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">77 Irrespective of the outcome of this case, the Authority, in my opinion, ought to have sought appropriate relief from the Court rather than resorting to self-help, involving the expunging the approvals and registrations of the Record and the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">No safety considerations were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Even if there had been, the Court could have made appropriate interim orders to deal with that situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Does the AAT have jurisdiction?</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">
 
78 The Authority seeks, amongst other things, a declaration pursuant to s 16(1)(a) of the ADJR Act that the AAT had no jurisdiction to make "stay orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">It also seeks the issue of writs of prohibition and certiorari as against the AAT under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">79 It says, correctly, that when the jurisdiction of the Court to challenge an administrative decision is invoked whether under s16 of the ADJR Act or under s 39B of the Judiciary Act , the Court is confined to exercising judicial power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Since it is not permissible for the Court to exercise administrative power, it cannot conduct a merit review of the decision, that is, an inquiry to determine the correct or most appropriate outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Its role is limited to determining whether the administrative decision is within the power conferred on the official and whether the decision-making process, in so far as the decision-maker was bound to comply with a particular process, has been followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The Court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The merits of the administrative action as distinct from its legality are not a matter for the Court: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40-41; Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">80 This Court's jurisdiction to make declarations and to issue writs of prohibition and certiorari is properly invoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The intervention of this Court is sought to review decisions of the AAT, of an administrative character, not on the basis of an excess of jurisdiction failure to afford procedural fairness or any other recognised ground but rather because the AAT is said to have no jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">81 Imtrade contends that the Authority's actions in removing the approvals from the Record and the registrations from the Register amount in effect to a decision to cancel under Div 5 of Part 2 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">If that were the case then such a decision is reviewable under s 167(1)(f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">82 The Authority contends, ultimately as a matter of law, that each approval and registration is invalid and of no legal effect because each was affected, procured, or induced by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">There was no cancellation of approvals or registrations under the Code because there was nothing to cancel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">It follows, Imtrade submits, that there is no decision to cancel reviewable by the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">83 The word "decision" in the Code has, by virtue of s 167(4) the same meaning as in the AAT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">There was no suggestion that the removal of the approvals and registrations by the Authority was other than a "decision" for the purposes of the wide definition of that word provided in s 3(3) of the AAT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The issue is whether for the purposes of s 25(1)(a) of the AAT Act it was a "decision(s) made in the exercise of powers conferred by ..." s 167 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The meaning of "decision" in s 25 of the AAT Act was considered in Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The majority construed "decision" as including one in purported exercise of powers conferred by the enactment: Brian Lawlor per Bowen CJ at 317 and Smithers J at 339.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">84 A number of decisions, using that word loosely, were made by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It made a decision to remove the approvals and registrations from the Record and Register respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">This was the consequence of its earlier decision to treat these approvals and registrations as of no legal effect: a decision that, at law, it had made no decisions to approve under s 19 or to register under s 20 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">85 The question here is whether the Authority's decision to regard the various approvals and registrations as of no effect at law and to implement that decision by "removing" those approvals and registrations from the Record and the Register constituted a purported exercise of powers conferred by the enactment and therefore reviewable pursuant to s 167 of the Code by the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">This test is an objective one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">I would respectfully adopt what Bowen CJ said on this point in Brian Lawlor at 314-315: 
 It seems inappropriate to interpret s 25 so as to make this dependent upon the state of mind of the official.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">It would, if adopted, appear to introduce a false issue and to impose upon the person aggrieved the burden of proving it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">He could well be the very person, who was ignorant of that state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Perhaps also it would involve the consequence that if the evidence on an appeal to the Tribunal showed that an official did not honestly believe he was acting in the exercise of powers conferred by the enactment, the appeal would have to be dismissed notwithstanding that the absence of honest belief might not affect the legal standing of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">... in the ordinary course, it would be reasonably clear from the objective facts under which enactment or in the exercise of which statutory powers an official had purported to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The adoption of this view would mean that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a decision in fact made, which purported to be made in the exercise of powers under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">It could then proceed to determine whether the decision was properly made in fact and in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">(Emphasis added) 
In my opinion it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">The Authority took no step provided for under Div 5 of Part 2 of the Code directed to cancellation of approvals and registrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">86 Section 35 of the Code provides that the Authority must not cancel an approval or registration unless it has first given notice and then waited for an adequate period thereafter as provided under s 35(a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The Authority did not give any such notice(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">It did not make entries in the Record or Register provided for under s 45 following cancellation under the Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Nor did it give any notice under s 45A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">This was not by reason of error or omission on the part of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">This is not a case involving a "colourable exercise of actual power": Brian Lawlor at p 342 per Deane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The Authority deliberately took no steps to cancel the approvals and registrations under the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Here, the Authority placed no reliance, actual or purported, upon the Code to remove the approvals from the Record and the registrations from the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Indeed it stated in correspondence to Imtrade that as a result of fraud arising from the provision of the false name and address in respect of Evergreen the relevant active constituents were "unapproved" and the relevant chemical products were "unregistered".</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">87 The Authority did issue a recall notice to Imtrade under s 101 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">It was not a pre-condition to doing so that the Authority must first have cancelled the registrations under Division 5 of Part 2 of the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">It is open to the Authority to issue a recall notice where a chemical product is not registered: s 101(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The Authority considered that the various chemical products were unregistered because the registrations, vitiated by fraud, had been "removed" from the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">88 Accordingly it is, I think, wrong to characterise its conduct, as Imtrade does, as, in effect, cancellation of the approvals and registrations under the Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">89 The Authority has asked this Court to resolve the mixed questions of fact and law upon its core legal contention that the approvals and registrations variously were invalid because they were affected by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The AAT has no jurisdiction to determine such a question of law: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In treating the several approvals and registrations as invalid and of no effect the Authority did not exercise a regulatory power under the legislative scheme and has not made a decision reviewable under s 167(1)(f) of the Code or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">90 For the above reasons the application, to the extent that it seeks declarations that the 9 approvals and 52 registrations are of no legal effect, will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Their removal from the Record and the Register was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The relevant approvals and registrations ought be restored to the Record and the Register, each effective from the respective dates of their original approval and registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">There will be declarations that the variation of the relevant particulars to 47 of the 52 registrations is, in each case, of no legal effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">This, as I have said, does not affect the validity of the prior registrations to which the variations relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">There ought, in respect to the first respondent, be declarations and prerogative relief, as sought by the applicant, subject to questions of unnecessary overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">I will invite the parties to bring in a minute of consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">There will be liberty to the parties to apply in the event that such agreement cannot be reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">I will also hear the parties on the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">I certify that the preceding ninety (90) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Associate:
