On 11 April 2005 the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Minister") refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.
He was detained on 8 February 2005 after having lived and worked illegally in Australia since the expiry of his 6 week visitor's visa in November 1991.
After being detained, he lodged two protection visa applications with the Department of Immigration ("The Department") within a week, claiming to fear persecution for different reasons.
The Federal Magistrate found there was no breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("The Act") and that the Tribunal was entitled to reject the new claim.
7 The Tribunal recorded in its reasons for decision that it had before it the appellant's Departmental file.
The Tribunal's reference to not having before it any evidence of an earlier visa application may be a reference to what the Tribunal had gleaned from an examination of the Departmental file.
Indeed the solicitor representing the appellant conceded before the Tribunal that material concerning the earlier protection visa was on the Departmental file, which suggests that the Tribunal's reference to there being "no evidence" was not based on an examination of the file.
9 As to the third matter, it was submitted that the Tribunal misconstrued the Treaty between India and Nepal which, it was argued, did not entitle the appellant, a Nepalese citizen, to reside in India.
Reliance was placed on the observations of Lee J in WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 at 278, which might be viewed as indicating that it is necessary for there to be a prior acceptance or acknowledgement by a third country to enliven s 36(3) of the Act.
