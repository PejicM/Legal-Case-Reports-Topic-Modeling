1 This is an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant the appellants a Business Skills (Residence) (Class BH) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The first appellant ('the appellant'), a citizen of the People's Republic of China, applied for the relevant visa on 27 February 2003, with the other appellants (her spouse, daughter and stepson) relying on membership of the appellant's family unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 The delegate decided to refuse to grant the visas on 14 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellants sought review of that decision by the Tribunal and on 30 June 2005 the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">By application to the Federal Magistrates Court filed 23 August 2005, the appellants sought relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) against the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 21 December 2006 the Federal Magistrates Court declined to grant relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The federal magistrate conveniently set out the relevant legislation in his reasons: see Xin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 1925 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">For present purposes, the essential criterion for entitlement to the business visa is that set out in cl 845.215 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations'), which provides:
 
 The total value of the net assets owned by the applicant, or by the applicant and the applicant's spouse together, in the main business or main businesses in Australia: 
 (a) is; and 
 
 
 (b) has been throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application; 
 
 
 at least AUD100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">

5 On the basis of the application for a business visa, the appellant nominated Quincy Development Pty Limited ('Quincy'), as the main business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 The Tribunal was satisfied that Quincy was a main business, and the first appellant had an "ownership interest" in Quincy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">However the Tribunal found that the first appellant did not satisfy the criterion in cl 845.215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In applying the criterion in cl 845.215 the Tribunal identified the relevant period as being from 27 February 2002 to 27 February 2003, this being the "period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">7 In determining the total value of the net assets owned by the appellant in the main business the Tribunal took into account that the appellant had a 49% shareholding in Quincy during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant claimed that during the relevant period, Quincy owed her $61,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Tribunal took this into account in determining the appellant's net assets in the business, in the sense that the debt owed by the business to the appellant was added to the value of the net assets of the business itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Based on the evidence as to the net assets of Quincy and taking into account the $61,000 debt owed by Quincy to the appellant, the Tribunal made preliminary calculations of the value of the appellant's net assets in Quincy, indicating at relevant times net assets over $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 It was the financial records given by the appellant to the Tribunal through her representative that provided the framework and evidence for the Tribunal's findings as to the assets of Quincy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">After making the preliminary calculations, the Tribunal identified four additional factors bearing on the valuation of Quincy's assets, including the need to adjust the "Cash at Bank" amount to more accurately reflect Quincy's position as at 27 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal only needed to consider this factor, namely the need for an adjustment of the "Cash at Bank" figure, because making the adjustment meant that the appellant did not satisfy the criterion in cl 845.215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 The Tribunal undertook a calculation of the figures before it and, putting aside one trivial error which was in the appellant's favour, determined the adjustment necessary to be made to the "Cash at Bank" amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">10 The adjustment to the "Cash at Bank" figures to reflect the true position as at 27 February 2002 took the value of the total value of the appellant's net assets in Quincy well below $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal considered this sufficient to dispose of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Relevantly, cl 845.215 requires that the total value of the net assets owed by the visa applicant in the main business must have been at least $100,000 throughout the period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Accordingly, once the Tribunal had concluded that, as at 27 February 2002, the total value of the net assets held by the appellant in Quincy was less than $100,000, then on this analysis the appellant would not satisfy the criterion in cl 845.215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">11 Having identified a reduction in the assets below $100,000, the Tribunal went on to consider whether the deficit could be made up by some other asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">However, the Tribunal concluded there was nothing to suggest that any such asset existed to lift the value of the appellant's holding back above $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal noted that payments made to Quincy after 27 February 2002 could have no bearing on the question of the value of Quincy's on 27 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It was thus not necessary for the Tribunal to elaborate on its concern about the other three factors that would otherwise have necessitated an adjustment to the figures, and it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to put a precise figure on the adjustments that it may otherwise have needed to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">12 The Tribunal, having concluded that the appellant did not satisfy the criteria for a business visa, necessarily determined that the members of the appellant's family unit (the other appellants in this proceeding) were also not entitled to visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">13 The decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, which is the subject of this appeal, addressed the grounds identified in the appellant's application and also identified additional grounds raised in an affidavit filed by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Having concluded there was no error on the part of the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">14 Before this Court, the notice of appeal identifies two grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The first ground is a bare assertion of legal error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The second ground asserts that an error was made by the Tribunal when it applied the criterion in cl 845.215, which was addressed by the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">15 I adopt the reasons of his Honour in relation to the second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The interpretation by the Tribunal of cl 845.215 was plainly correct, and the clause was properly applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal was not at large and had to apply the law as provided in the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">16 When the Act says that the Tribunal is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence, and shall act in accordance with the substantial justice and merits of the case (see s 353(2)), it does not mean the Tribunal can ignore the application of cl 845.215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In my view, having determined the correct interpretation of cl 845.215, the Tribunal then applied it correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The appellants had ample opportunity to present evidence to the Tribunal in the way they chose to satisfy the criterion set down by cl 845.215, and they failed to satisfy such criterion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">17 The Tribunal's function was to assess the evidence, and although it was of an accounting nature, there is nothing in the Tribunal's reasoning to indicate error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On the contrary, the evidence before the Tribunal supports the analysis undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I do not consider that the trivial arithmetic error pointed out by the appellant in the Tribunal's reciting of a figure indicates an error of reasoning or analysis to justify the intervention of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The error involved the Tribunal making reference to an incorrect amount in the Commonwealth Bank account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Specifically, the Tribunal noted:
 
 [A]s at 7 January 2002 and, therefore 15 January 2002 the balance was $89,071.91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">However, on 27 February 2002, the balance in the Commonwealth account was $76,118.82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

18 It would appear from the relevant Commonwealth Bank statement that the correct figure for 27 February 2002 was in fact $76,024.62 rather than $76,118.82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">However, in my view the error was of a trivial nature and was in any event in the appellant's favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">But as I have said, the more important point is that it does not indicate a more substantial error of reasoning or analysis on the Tribunal's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">19 The Tribunal need not be comprised of members who are qualified accountants or auditors, as seems to be suggested by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal is entitled to act upon the evidence before it to reach a conclusion according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In any event, in the way the Tribunal approached its task, I do not consider the conclusions reached depended upon any specific accounting expertise it needed to have itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">20 To the extent that the appellant wanted a further opportunity to address the material she presented to the Tribunal, it was incumbent upon her to explain or put in context the accounts or transactions which occurred, or to indicate where a document may be inconclusive or needed further elaboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">21 If the appellant desired to place evidence before the Tribunal she could do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I note that the appellant did introduce accounting evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I observe the Tribunal allowed on a number of occasions time for additional information to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In the end, once the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the relevant period was 27 February 2002 to 27 February 2003, then on the evidence presented to it, it could not have been satisfied the appellant met the criterion set forth in cl 845.215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">22 In addition to the grounds of appeal, the appellant relied upon grounds which were in almost identical terms to grounds relied upon in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Each of the discrete points raised (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">error of law and misapplication of cl 845.215, breach of s 353, breach of s 359A and breach of s 379A) were addressed by the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Subject to one qualification, I find no error in his Honour's reasoning or conclusions in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I do observe that the mere fact that reference is made to information in the Court book or to information being given to the delegate (as distinct from the Tribunal) is not sufficient to establish compliance with s 359A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Here, it is clear that the Tribunal itself was given all of the information relied upon for the purposes of the application by the appellant or her representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">23 It is my view, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Associate:
