<sentence id="s0">
 This case concerns one ramification of arrangement made in an endeavour to keep a significant, but insolvent, supplier of car parts to the Australian automotive manufacturers in business for the time being.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The particular point concerns the effect of liabilities that may arise out of agreements reached between the voluntary administrators of Huon Corporation Pty Limited ACN 115 243 206 (Huon) and several automotive manufacturers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 30 June 2006 Anthony Milton Sims, Kenneth Stewart Sellers and Scott Darren Pascoe were appointed as joint and several voluntary administrators of Huon pursuant to s 436A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Evidence has been given in some detail as to the history of Huon, the financial position of Huon at the time of the appointment of the administrators, the nature of the substantial business being conducted and the various steps that the administrators had taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The administrators formed the opinion that the maintenance of the business of Huon as a going concern is crucial in order to obtain the best value for the assets of Huon for the benefit of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It is their view that, if Huon cannot be sold as a going concern, it will very likely reduce the value the administrators can obtain for the assets which will, in turn, reduce the ultimate return available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">That is a matter of business judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The administrators worked towards that end with some urgency because, following certain redundancies on or about 14 July 2006, the employees of all of the business units of Huon went on strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Negotiations ensued with customers, trade unions and the Victorian State government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Arising out of those negotiations, the administrators entered into agreements dated 25 July 2006 with Huon and each of the following customers: (1) GM Holden Ltd ACN 006 893 232; (2) Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd ACN 009 686 097; (3) Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited ACN 004 116 228; and (4) ZF Lemforder Australia Pty Ltd ACN 107 494 253; 
(the Supply Agreements).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An agreement was also entered into with another customer, PBR Australia Pty Ltd, which is not in issue in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Supply Agreements relate to the business unit of Huon known as Empire Rubber, which operated from a property at Bendigo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They are virtually identical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">A satisfactory summary of the key terms of the agreements is as follows: (1) The customer acknowledges that nothing contained in the Supply Agreement gives rise to any personal liability on the part of the administrators other than any liability that the administrators have under the Act or at law (cl 1.5(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">(2) Huon agrees to supply to the customer and the customer agrees to purchase the products and volumes for the months of July, August, September and October 2006 set out in Schedule 1 to the Supply Agreement or the latest delivery schedules submitted by the customer to Huon prior to the commencement of the Supply Agreement (cl 4.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">(3) The customer agrees to a 35 per cent increase in the price that the customer was required to pay for equivalent products prior to the commencement of the Supply Agreement (the Price Increase).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This increase is payable in order to reflect the estimated additional operating expenses of running the Empire plant during the period of the Supply Agreement (cl 5.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">(4) In consideration of the customer agreeing to the Price Increase, Huon agrees to grant the customer a price rebate (Price Rebate) (cl 6.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Price Rebate for each customer comprises its share of the total Price Increases for all of the customers multiplied by: (a) Any cash surplus from revenue earned by Huon from the supply of products from the Empire plant during the period of the Supply Agreement after all operating expenses have been fully satisfied (Surplus).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">'Operating Expenses' is defined as 'the costs, remuneration and expenses of the administrators relating to the conduct of the business but excluding any employee entitlements accrued prior to the appointment date or any redundancy entitlements'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">(b) Any excess of the sale proceeds from the sale of the Empire business as a going concern and/or the Bendigo property, once the amounts owing to the secured creditors in respect of the Empire business and the Bendigo property and the costs, remuneration and expenses (including trading losses) of the administrators relating to the conduct of the Empire business have been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">(5) Pursuant to cl 6.2 and cl 6.3 of the Supply Agreements, the maximum amount payable by Huon to each of the customers is the total amount of the Price Increase paid by that customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">(6) Clause 6.5 of the Supply Agreements provides that the administrators must make application to either the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of Victoria as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Supply Agreements (being 25 July 2006 in each case) for orders to give effect to cl 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">(7) If there is no Surplus or excess sale proceeds from the sale of the Empire business or the Bendigo property, then no part of the Price Increase is repayable to the customers by Huon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It should be noted that the administrators, Huon and GE Commercial Corporation (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 000 974 747 (a secured creditor pursuant to a floating charge) have entered into a Deed of Funding and Consent, which has established a priority regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The effect of cl 5.1 of that Deed is to give first priority to moneys owed by Huon to the administrators supported by the statutory indemnity and lien pursuant to s 443E and s 443F of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Price Rebate obligations undertaken in cl 6 of the Supply Agreements give rise to the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The promises in that clause are made by Huon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is provided in cl 1.5 that the administrators are acting as agents of Huon pursuant to s 437B of the Act and nothing contained in the agreement gives rise to any personal liability on the part of the administrators other than any liability the administrators have under the Act or at law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Section 443A (which appears in subdiv A of Div 9 of Pt 5.3A of the Act) is as follows: 
 
 The administrator of a company under administration is liable for debts he or she incurs, in the performance or exercise, or purported performance or exercise, of any of his or her functions and powers as administrator, for: 
 
 services rendered; or 
 
 goods bought; or 
 
 property hired, leased, used or occupied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 Subsection (1) has effect despite any agreement to the contrary, but without prejudice to the administrator's rights against the company or anyone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">' 
 
 The relevant portions of ss 443D , 443E and 443F (which appear in subdiv B of Div 9 of Pt 5.3A of the Act) are as follows: 
 
 The administrator of a company under administration is entitled to be indemnified out of the company's property for: 
 
 debts for which the administrator is liable under Subdivision A or a remittance provision as defined in subsection 443BA(3); and 
 
 his or her remuneration as fixed under section 449E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 (1) Subject to section 556 , a right of indemnity under section 443D has priority over: 
 
 all the company's unsecured debts; and 
 
 subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, debts of the company secured by a floating charge on property of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">... 
 
 (1) To secure a right of indemnity under section 443D , the administrator has a lien on the company's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 A lien under subsection (1) has priority over a charge only in so far as the right of indemnity under section 443D has priority over debts secured by the charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 
 The administrators contend that the obligations under the Supply Agreements fall within s 443A and seek a direction to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">There is an initial question as to whether any liability which ensues would properly be described as a 'debt'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Counsel has properly referred me to the decision of Branson J in Molit (No55) Pty Ltd v Lam Soon Australia Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) &amp; Macks (1996) 68 FCR 319 in which a strict instruction of the term 'debt' is adopted, drawing a distinction between a debt and a liability for unliquidated damages in this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Counsel has pointed out that, in other sections, the words such as 'debt' and 'creditor' have been given a wider construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The provision for insolvent trading is one example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Another is the construction of s 563A in Sons of Gwalia Ltd v Margaretic [2006] FCAFC 17 ; (2005) 149 FCR 227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There is also a question as to whether the liabilities are 'incurred' by reason of cl 6, at least unless and until there is a surplus to be distributed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Counsel has referred to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Hawkins v Bank of China (1992) 26 NSWLR 562 which dealt with whether a relevant debt was incurred when a company entered into a guarantee under which it was obliged to pay a liquidator an amount contingent upon demand following default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It is not necessary for me to decide those interesting questions because, in my opinion, it is clear that any liability which ensues would not be for any of the topics enumerated in s 443A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The only possible argument is that the liability would be for services rendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I cannot view what is involved in cl 6 of the Supply Agreements as incurring a liability for services rendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In that respect, I would adopt the reasoning of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 at [45] ---[46].</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">(See also Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (2004) 51 ACSR 432; (2004) 23 ACLC 28 at [4].</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">) I decline to give the direction sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In the alternative, it is submitted that I should make an order pursuant to s 447A that Pt 5.3A of the Act is to operate in relation to Huon so that liabilities incurred pursuant to cl 6 should be deemed to have been debts incurred pursuant to s 443A for services rendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Such an order has substantive effect compared with the giving of directions (cf Gidley Re Aliance Motor Body Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 102 ; (2006) 150 FCR 345 at [3] ---[4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Because of this, it is necessary to ensure that notice has been given to those affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On the other hand, the application is not a lis between parties or adversary litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There is no need to manufacture a contradictor if there is not one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I am satisfied that all those who might be affected by an order have been effectively given notice of the proceeding and none has appeared to oppose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Indeed, there is actual consent on the part of almost all of those affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In particular, those most affected, the secured creditor and those representing employees with priority claims, have indicated consent and do not appear to oppose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">That does not lessen the scrutiny to be applied to the proposed application of s 447A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">That section grants a most unusual power to the Court that requires careful consideration before exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is not easy to grasp all of the ramifications of such an order in the absence of a contradictor, notwithstanding the assistance of counsel for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The arrangement is fundamentally a financing mechanism to enable the business to continue as a going concern but is more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The arrangement guarantees the sale on favourable terms of the products manufactured by the business and virtually ensures that the business will be profitable in the short term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The business risk has largely passed to the customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">This is to the benefit of other creditors who stand to gain from sale of the business as a going concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The only hesitation I have is whether it is appropriate to potentially include the surplus on the sale of the Bendigo property as part of Price Rebate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">That potentiality is by way of being part of the security for repayment of the advances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">However, it is difficult to unpick parts of an arrangement like this, which was the result of heavy negotiation between the interested parties and which, on the evidence, has the support of those most interested in the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The decisions of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 and of Finkelstein J in Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (above) and the orders made by Hely J in Re Henry Walker Eltin Group Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (No 4) [2005] FCA 745 provide support for making the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Order 2 as sought will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">


 I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
