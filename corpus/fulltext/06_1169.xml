<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 On 18 November 2005, the applicant filed a summons in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking a declaration that certain documents ('the Dimocks documents') seized by the Australian Federal Police ('AFP') pursuant to a search warrant addressed to Dimocks Family Lawyers ('Dimocks') executed on 11 November 2005 are documents to which legal professional privilege attaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant also seeks the return of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The search warrant was issued pursuant to s 225 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) ('POCA') in respect of an alleged breach of Commonwealth law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Accordingly, on 6 February 2006 the Supreme Court of New South Wales transferred the proceedings to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The documents seized from Dimocks are documents to which legal professional privilege would ordinarily attach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They are documents relating to legal advice provided by Dimocks to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, some of the documents are identical to documents which had been previously seized by the AFP from the applicant's residence, and in respect of which privilege has not been claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Other documents are identical to documents seized from the business premises of the applicant's husband at a later date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The question, therefore, is whether the applicant has waived privilege over the documents by her failure to claim privilege in respect of the other seizures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
 4 The applicant is the wife of Robert Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Robert Norman and his brother Mark Norman were the directors of M &amp; J Norman Pty Ltd trading as Norman &amp; Associates, Registered Tax Agents, at 44 Burwood Road, Burwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In September 2003 officers of the Australian Taxation Office ('ATO') seized documents from the premises of Norman &amp; Associates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In February 2004 the ATO referred the matter to the AFP for investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Charges have subsequently been laid against Robert Norman for taxation-related offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 Concord Search 
 
 5 At approximately 7.20 am on 20 May 2005, a search warrant issued under s 225 of the POCA was executed at 18 Creewood Avenue, Concord NSW ('the Concord premises'), where the applicant was residing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The warrant authorised the seizure of records and other items relating to several companies and persons including the applicant and Robert Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicant, Robert Norman and their daughter were present when the search commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 On arrival at the Concord premises, a federal agent, Susan Cooper, handed Robert Norman a copy of the search warrant, as well as a document entitled 'Rights of The Occupier', a document entitled 'Rights of a Person Searched' and a document entitled 'Claims for Legal Professional Privilege: Premises other than those of a Lawyer, Law Society or like Institution' which set out a procedure agreed between the AFP and the Law Council of Australia by which a claim of legal professional privilege could be made over seized materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant and her daughter were present when the documents were handed over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 During the execution of the warrant, the applicant handed to AFP officers several documents from a folder in the kitchen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant removed other documents from her handbag and gave them to AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">An envelope of documents contained in a basket on top of the refrigerator in the kitchen was also seized by an APF officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">All these documents ('the Concord documents') were taken and were recorded on an AFP Property Seizure Record ('PSR').</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 During the execution of the warrant, the applicant telephoned her solicitor Mr Andrew O'Brien.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She was advised by him not to answer any questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 The documents taken by the AFP included correspondence addressed to the applicant from her family law solicitor, Mr Dimock, relating to a proposed property settlement to be entered into between the applicant and her husband, Robert Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Those documents are identical to several documents referred to in the summons which were later seized from the office of Dimocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 First Rosebery search 
 
 10 Simultaneously with the Concord search, the AFP executed a warrant at 4A Rothschild Avenue, Rosebery NSW ('the Rosebery premises'), where Robert Norman was conducting a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The warrant authorised the seizure of records relating to three companies and four persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">One of the named persons was Robert Norman, but the applicant was not named in this warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 Several documents were seized by the AFP from the Rosebery address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Robert Norman claimed legal professional privilege in respect of some of the documents, although the claim for privilege was not pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">During the search at the Rosebery premises, a letter from Dimocks, dated 13 April 2005 and addressed to the applicant, was found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The letter was not seized but it was noted that the letter related to proposed property settlement arrangements between the applicant and Robert Norman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 Search of Dimocks Family Lawyers 
 
 12 On 17 October 2005 a production order was issued pursuant to s 202(1) of the POCA requiring Mr Dimock to produce documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Some documents were produced in response to the order but copies of documents which had been obtained in the Concord search, and the letter which had been found at the Rosebery premises, were not included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Accordingly, on 11 November 2005, a search warrant issued under s 225 of the POCA was executed on the offices of Dimocks authorising the seizure of records relating to the applicant and Robert Norman (among others).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 During the execution of the warrant Mr Dimock made a claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the Dimocks documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Those documents are the subject of this dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 Second Rosebery Search 
 
 14 On 8 March 2006 a search warrant issued pursuant to s 3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was executed at the Rosebery premises and numerous documents were seized ('the Rosebery documents').</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Robert Norman made a claim of legal professional privilege in respect of some documents, including two documents related to the matrimonial property settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The documents over which privilege was claimed were placed in an archive box and delivered to the Downing Centre Local Court Chamber Magistrate, but the claim for privilege was not pursued and the documents were collected by the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Two of the Dimocks documents are identical to two of the Rosebery documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 THE DOCUMENTS IN ISSUE 
 
 15 At the request of both parties, I have examined the Dimocks documents in order to determine whether they are, as suspected, the same documents as those seized by the AFP during the Concord search and the second Rosebery search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I am satisfied that documents specified in paragraphs 1(b), 1(d), 1(i) and 1(m) of the summons are identical to document seized during the Concord search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I am also satisfied that documents 1(a) and 1(n) are identical to documents seized during the second Rosebery search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The AFP submits that the applicant has waived privilege over the Dimocks documents by failing to claim privilege in respect of the same documents obtained by the AFP from the Concord premises and the Rosebery premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">16 The applicant has indicated that she no longer claims privilege over documents 1(e), 1(f) and 1(h) and those have been released to the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In respect of the remaining documents, namely documents 1(c), 1(g), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l) and 1(o), these are not documents which have been seized by the AFP on another occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The respondents claim that if privilege has been waived over the seized documents, then privilege has also been waived over documents 1(c), 1(g), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l) and 1(o), because their contents are substantially the same as the Concord and Rosebery documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
 
 17 Legal professional privilege has been recognised as a fundamental right in our legal system since the reign of Elizabeth I (see Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton Rev 1961) Vol VIII, para 2290).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 Wilson J referred to the current principle of legal professional privilege (at 95) as follows: 
 
 
 'The multiplicity and complexity of the demands which the modern state makes upon its citizens underlines the continued relevance of the privilege to the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The adequate protection according to law of the privacy and liberty of the individual is an essential mark of a free society and unless abrogated or abridged by statute the common law privilege attaching to the relationship of solicitor and client is an important element in that protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 
 
 
 It is not only a matter of protection of the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The freedom to consult one's legal adviser in the knowledge that confidential communications will be safeguarded will often make its own contribution to the general level of respect for and observance of the law within the community --- see an article by Charles A Miller, "The Challenges to the Attorney --- Client Privilege" Virginian Law Review , vol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">49 (1963), p.262.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">' 
 
 
 18 In the same decision Deane J said (at 118): 
 
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I am persuaded that the general and substantive principle underlying legal professional privilege is of fundamental importance to the protection and preservation of the rights, dignity and equality of the ordinary citizen under the law in that it is a precondition of full and unreserved communication with his lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">' 
 
 
 19 Implied waiver of legal professional privilege was discussed by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In that decision, the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) observed (at 13): 
 
 
 'Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is "imputed by operation of law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 20 As recognised in the above passage, whether privilege has been impliedly waived depends upon an objective assessment whether conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege, not a consideration of the subjective intention of the party whose confidentiality the privilege protects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">21 In Mann v Carnell , the High Court referred to the case of Benecke v National Australia Bank Ltd (1993) 35 NSWLR 110, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In that case, a woman gave evidence concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings, apparently believing that she could prevent the barrister giving his version of the instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Court of Appeal held that privilege had been impliedly waived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The High Court said of that decision (at 13): 
 
 
 'She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">She may not even have turned her mind to the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However, her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 22 However both Mann v Carnell and Benecke involved circumstances where the alleged waiver resulted from a voluntary act by the holder of the privilege, albeit an act which was not intended to waive privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The present case involves circumstances where documents were provided under compulsion of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Several authorities have indicated that the considerations in such cases are likely to be different: see Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 473; Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364 at 368-9; Goldberg and Anor v Ng and Ors (1995) 132 ALR 57 at 68.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">23 Saunders concerned a claim for privilege in respect of documents seized by the AFP as part of an ongoing investigation into the taxation affairs of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It had been submitted by the AFP in that case that because the applicant failed to claim privilege at the time of the execution of the warrant, he had impliedly waived privilege over the seized documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In that case, the AFP relied on observations of Mason J in Baker v Campbell at 80 to the effect that the authorities seemed to suggest that privilege was lost as soon as a document passed into the hands of another who may tender it in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">French J in Saunders said of these observations at 473: 
 
 
 'With respect, these observations of the majority in Baker v Campbell fall a long way short of the suggestion that the seizure under warrant of a document the subject of legal professional privilege which has not been waived causes that privilege to be lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The fact that the seizure may have occurred in circumstances in which the officer executing the warrant was unaware of the subsistence of legal professional privilege in the relevant document does not, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that the privilege is lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">' 
 
 
 24 In Saunders , the applicant claimed to have indicated at the time of the execution of the warrant that he reserved his rights to challenge the lawfulness of the seizure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">However in Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364, Mullins J held that the right to claim legal professional privilege over documents seized pursuant to a search warrant was not lost because a claim was not made at the time of seizure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Mullins J noted two relevant factors: firstly, that the respondent had been wrongfully informed that he could not contact the solicitors who were acting for him; and secondly, that the claim for privilege was made at the first available opportunity after having spoken with the solicitor acting for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">25 It is clear nonetheless that the failure to claim privilege can in some circumstances constitute a waiver of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) v Bank of New Zealand (1991) 26 NSWLR 711 Cole J found that the respondent had waived legal professional privilege because it had failed to make a claim when it knew that a document had been in the hands of the Registrar of the Court, and possibly in the hands of a third party, for a period of twelve days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Cole J observed at 730: 
 
 
 'There seems to me to be no reason in principle why a party may not, by conduct, waive legal professional privilege by omitting to claim that privilege when it is available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There is no distinction in principle between failure to claim legal professional privilege for a document by including it in a list of documents discovered and available for inspection, without claiming legal professional privilege, and on the other hand sitting by and allowing use of the document already in the hands of the other party without claiming legal professional privilege, or omitting to take steps to claim legal professional privilege in respect of the document known to be in the hands of the court, or as here, the liquidator, which it was obviously intended to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Each constitutes an implicit waiver because it constitutes an abandonment of the claim for protection (regarding abandonment see Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v Maurice (at 498) per Dawson J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' 
 
 FINDINGS 
 
 26 The claimed waiver in the present case relates to documents seized pursuant to two different search warrants which were executed some months apart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The first search warrant was executed on the Concord premises several months before the documents which are the subject of the present application were seized from Dimocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The second search warrant was executed on the Rosebery premises several months after the Dimocks documents were seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Different considerations may apply to the documents seized in each of these two searches, and in my opinion it is appropriate that they be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 The Concord documents 
 
 27 The warrant at the Concord premises was executed on 20 May 2005 at which time documents 1(b), 1(d), 1(i) and 1(m) were seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The applicant made no claim for legal professional privilege in relation to those documents at that time or subsequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In fact, the applicant has never made a claim for legal professional privilege specifically in relation to the documents seized on 20 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Rather, the claim is made in respect of the documents seized from Dimocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">28 The search of Dimocks occurred on 11 November 2005, almost six months after the Concord premises had been searched.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Mr Dimock made a claim for legal professional privilege at the time of the search and on 18 November 2005, these proceedings were commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">However, in the preceding six months, the applicant had made no claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the Concord documents, several of which were identical to the Dimocks documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">29 The applicant submits that she was unaware of her right to claim legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">She points out that a copy of the document outlining the right to claim legal professional privilege was given to her husband, but not to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">She submits also that the PSR which was completed in relation to the Concord search did not describe the documents sufficiently, such that it was not clear that the documents seized were documents to which privilege was likely to attach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">She submits that in these circumstances, the fact that she took no action to assert a claim for privilege was not inconsistent with the continuance of the privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">30 I agree that the PSR which was filled out in respect of the Concord search did not describe the documents sufficiently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">If the applicant had sought legal advice subsequent to the search, a solicitor would have been unable to determine from the PSR alone whether the documents attracted legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Nonetheless, I accept the submission of the respondent that in the circumstances of this case, the applicant knew the nature of the documents which were taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">This is not a case in which many boxes of documents were seized, and where it would have been difficult or impossible for the applicant to know precisely what had been taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There were very few documents taken from the Concord premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Further, the documents relating to her legal affairs were, for the most part, provided to the AFP by the applicant herself and she was present when the documents were seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">She was aware that the documents which were handed over related to her family law affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">31 Further, it is clear from the transcript of the search proceedings (at 2) that the applicant was told: 
 
 
 'Under the warrant I must also provide you with a copy of your rights, which I've given you there and a guideline if you wish to claim legal professional privilege on any of the items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">And we do have the right to search either of you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">We'll determine that at a later date if that's needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">And that's your rights there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">' 
 
 
 32 I accept that the Guidelines relating to legal professional privilege were not handed to the applicant directly, but rather were handed to her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I think this was unfortunate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I also consider it unfortunate that no further details of the applicant's rights with respect of legal professional privilege were explained to her, given that it was expected under the Guidelines that she assert privilege immediately in respect of any privileged documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The applicant is a lay person and it is far from clear that she was aware of her rights to object to the seizure of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">A brief explanation to the extent that she could object to the AFP taking any documents which were communications with her lawyer may have prompted her to raise an objection at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">33 Nonetheless, it is apparent that the applicant was at least alerted to the existence of rights in respect of legal professional privilege by the federal agent who attended the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The applicant spoke to a solicitor during the course of the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Unfortunately, the lawyer did not give her any advice in respect of her right to claim legal professional privilege, but rather told her not to answer any questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">There is no evidence that the applicant sought advice from a lawyer subsequently in relation to the Concord search, but if she did, no claim for legal professional privilege was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I accept that the applicant was flustered at the time of the search and may not have been in a position to consider and assert her rights at that time, but there is no reason why she could not have sought advice, and made a claim for privilege, subsequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">No suggestion was made that the documents were privileged until more than six months later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">34 The applicant says that she was not under suspicion of any offence and that no charges have been filed against her, but rather, it was her husband who was of interest to the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The applicant also submits that at the time of the Concord search, she was not involved in any litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">She says that these are relevant circumstances which would make it unreasonable to imply waiver from her failure to claim privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">35 I do not accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Whilst it is true that the applicant was not the subject of a police investigation, or involved in litigation, this is not a determinative consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It may often be the case that the police seize documents from persons who are not then or subsequently charged with a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The police will often seize documents from persons when no proceedings have yet been (or will ever be) commenced against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Those facts alone do not obviate the need for a person whose documents are seized to make a claim of privilege, if such a claim is to be made, within a reasonable time period after the seizure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">36 In all the circumstances, I consider that the applicant must be taken to have waived her right to privilege over the Concord documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">She was aware of the nature of the documents which had been seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">She had been alerted to the possibility that legal professional privilege could be claimed by the statement of the AFP officer during the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">She spoke to a solicitor during the course of the search, and it was open to her to seek further advice subsequently if she was concerned about the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The AFP had control of the documents for over six months before there was any suggestion that the applicant claimed legal professional privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">When a claim for privilege was made, it was made not by the applicant but by her family law solicitor, following a search of his premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This omission to make a claim of privilege over such a prolonged period was, in my opinion, inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Accordingly, I find that privilege in respect of the Concord documents has been waived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 The Rosebery documents 
 
 37 The circumstances pertaining to the Rosebery documents are somewhat different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The most significant difference is that the documents seized in the second Rosebery raid were seized after the claim for privilege in respect of the Dimocks documents had been made and these proceedings had been commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicant submits that it was unnecessary, in those circumstances, to assert a second claim of privilege because it was clear that she was claiming privilege in respect of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">38 Legal professional privilege is asserted to prevent the production of documents to which a right of confidentiality attaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It is a restriction on the powers to require production which are otherwise authorised by the issue of a search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It is my opinion that an applicant must assert legal professional privilege each time a search warrant is executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">If a claim for privilege is not made at the time of or within a reasonable period of the execution of the warrant, the search warrant authorises its addressee to seize and make use of all those documents which fall within the terms of the warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The AFP may have had good reasons to suspect the documents seized in the second Rosebery search were the same documents which had been seized in the Dimocks search, and in respect of which a claim for legal professional privilege had already been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However, as it had never seen the Dimocks documents, it could not be certain that this was in fact the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">It would be unreasonable to expect the AFP to treat seized documents as subject to privilege on the basis of a claim arising from a separate search warrant, when it could not be certain that the documents were in fact the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The applicant should, in my opinion, have made a second claim of privilege in respect of the documents seized in the second Rosebery search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">39 The question, therefore, is whether her failure to do so is such that a waiver of privilege should be imputed by operation of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The circumstances of the second Rosebery search were different from those of the Concord search in several respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The documents in the second Rosebery search were seized from the business premises of the applicant's husband and not her own residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is no evidence she had any involvement with the Rosebery premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The applicant was not present during the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The applicant was not personally alerted by the AFP regarding the seized documents pertaining to her legal affairs and there is no evidence that she was personally aware that it had seized material in respect of which she might make a claim for privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">40 However, by the time of the execution of the second Rosebery warrant, the applicant had instructed Mr O'Brien to act on her behalf in respect of the proceedings under the POCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">No claim was made by Mr O'Brien for legal professional privilege on behalf of the applicant, despite the fact that Mr O'Brien was contacted in respect of a claim for legal professional privilege made by Robert Norman at the time of the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">That claim was apparently abandoned by Robert Norman, because no proceedings were instituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">41 It is true that Mr O'Brien was not present at the second Rosebery search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However, the PSR from the second Rosebery search clearly described the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">There is no evidence when the PSR was made available to Mr O'Brien, but it seems likely that it was provided to him by Robert Norman shortly after the search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Mr O'Brien gave evidence that Robert Norman had telephoned him after each search and no evidence was led which suggests that a claim for legal professional privilege was not made immediately because Mr O'Brien was unaware that legal documents pertaining to the applicant were among those seized during the second Rosebery search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In those circumstances, I infer that Mr O'Brien was aware of the documents which had been seized, but did not make a claim for privilege on behalf of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I note that by outlining the above facts I do not intend any criticism of Mr O'Brien, about whose instructions I have very little information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">42 In my opinion, that conduct is inconsistent with the continuation of privilege in the documents seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I recognise that the right to maintain the confidentiality of legal advice attaches to the applicant rather than to her legal advisor: see Mann v Carnell at [28].</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">However, in this case, the applicant had instructed Mr O'Brien to advise her in relation to the privilege claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Mr O'Brien, having knowledge of the seized documents from both Dimocks and the Rosebery premises, did not make a claim for privilege on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The fact that the documents were being held pending a claim for privilege was drawn to his attention by the facsimile from the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">He did not then make a claim for legal professional privilege and accordingly abandoned Robert Norman's claim for privilege.</sentence>
