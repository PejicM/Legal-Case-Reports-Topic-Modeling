 Introduction 
 
1 Percy and Beryl Kimpton are retired farmers, living on service pensions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">During their working lives they were shareholders in two family companies involving cattle farming and other agricultural pursuits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Those companies became dormant in 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They had assets comprising loans owing to them by members of the Kimpton family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The loans were made before the companies stopped trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 On 1 January 2002 amendments to the Act came into force which allowed for the attribution of certain assets of private companies to individuals associated with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Assets so attributed could be taken into account in the means testing of service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The loan accounts held by the Kimptons' companies were taken into account in 2002 as assets affecting their service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The companies were wound up late in 2002 but the Repatriation Commission (the Commission) continued to treat the relevant assets as attributed assets for the purpose of the assessment of the Kimptons' service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 After a rather convoluted process of decision and review, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) decided, on 20 September 2005, that the loan accounts should be treated as excluded assets and not taken into account for the purpose of means testing the Kimptons' service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 The Commission has appealed to this Court against the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It says that the Tribunal failed to accord it natural justice in treating the relevant assets as excluded and that it failed to take into account applicable Decision Making Principles made under the provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On both of those grounds the Commission's appeal fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is however apparent that the Tribunal proceedings miscarried in that it failed to decide upon a significant question put to it by the Commission as to whether the winding up of the companies involved an imputed disposal of the shares held by the Kimptons pursuant to the anti-avoidance provision, s 52E of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">If the Tribunal decision stands and the matter is remitted to the Commission, it is possible that it may be open to the Commission to decide the matter adversely to the Kimptons on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This may lead to another round of Tribunal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In my opinion it is appropriate that the Commission be given the opportunity to amend its ground of appeal to expressly raise that question which was argued before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">If the grounds of appeal are so amended by 12 September 2006, then the Tribunal decision will be set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">If the notice of appeal is not amended, then the Tribunal decision will stand and the appeal will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In my opinion the Kimptons should have their costs in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Factual and procedural background 
 
6 Percy Lawrence Kimpton and his wife Beryl Kimpton receive a service pension under the provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They were both born in rural Victoria, Mr Kimpton in 1924 and Mrs Kimpton in 1929.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 Mr and Mrs Kimpton carried on cattle farming in the Kununurra region in the 1970s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">They formed a company called Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Studs Pty Ltd (KPS) in January 1971 under the Companies Act 1961 (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">KPS had a nominal capital of $100,000 divided into 100,000 shares of $1 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Its objects included 'to conduct or carry on the business of stud masters and commercial breeders and fatteners of cattle, sheep and other livestock'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Kimpton was one of the subscribers for its shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (KS) was incorporated under the Companies Act in September 1972.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Its objects included carrying on the business of 'grazier, butcher, agriculturalist, farmer, horticulturalist, pastoralist, and to deal in all products of animal husbandry and agriculture'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">KS was, from the outset, a family company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr and Mrs Kimpton subscribed for one share each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In 1984 each of their sons, Gregory, Guy and Scott, were also issued with one share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">9 The cattle business of KPS was short lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The company's herd became infected with red water fever carried by cattle tick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr and Mrs Kimpton, her brother and their son Gregory, used the company for agricultural trading purposes from 1975 to 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">From 1979 to 1980 KPS carried on business as a transport company carting grain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It did not trade at all between 1981 and 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Mrs Kimpton's brother ceased his involvement in 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">On 2 November 1992 Mr and Mrs Kimpton resigned as directors of the company, thereby relinquishing its control to their son, Gregory, and his wife, Susanne, so that they could use it for their own business purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Mr and Mrs Kimpton nevertheless remained shareholders of KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">KPS ceased to trade after 30 June 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">10 KS was involved in agriculture until 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It was inactive from 1980 to 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In 1989 Mr and Mrs Kimpton and their sons, Scott and Gregory, resigned as directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Control of KS passed to Guy Kimpton and his wife, Julia, who used it to carry on a transport business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">11 As at 30 June 2002 the only assets of KS and KPS were loans owing to them by members of the Kimpton family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The loans were made before the companies stopped trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Subsequent changes in those accounts reflected administrative costs paid by family members on behalf of the companies and payment of a dividend to the shareholders of KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">12 On 1 January 2002 amendments to the Act came into force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The amendments attributed certain assets and income of private trusts and companies to individuals associated with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">By that mechanism the assets and income so attributed could be taken into account in the means testing of service pensions payable to such individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The amendments had been foreshadowed in written advice to the Kimptons from the Department of Veterans Affairs (the Department) in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Department had sought information from them about their interest in KS and KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They told the Department that the assets of the two companies consisted entirely of unsecured loans, being $254,860 in the case of KS and $41,770 in the case of KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">They also told the Department that they had no plans to wind up the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 On 6 February 2002 a delegate of the Commission wrote to Mr and Mrs Kimpton advising that their service pension had been reduced and that the change would take effect from 19 February 2002 so that the total fortnightly payment made to each of them would be $137.75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The change was based upon the net market value shown for their 'business'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A table incorporated in the letter referred to KS and KPS as designated companies and identified assets of $101,464 attributed to the Kimptons on account of their association with KS and $41,770 on account of their association with KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">This was later referred to by the Commission, in its Statement of Facts and Contentions to the Tribunal, as 'the attribution decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">14 The Kimptons consulted their accountant, Mr Byrnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Following discussions with the delegate Mr Byrnes wrote to her on 20 March 2002 saying: 
 
 'Further to our recent discussion, we enclose signed Balance Sheets for the above two dormant companies as at 18 March 2002 along with letters from the directors of their intentions to liquidate/delist the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Both companies have a "nil" asset position at 18 March 2002 and have been dormant for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Since the companies have no value, Mr and Mrs Kimpton's pensions should not be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">' 
 
 

The letter attached a statement signed by Mr and Mrs Kimpton as shareholders of KS that it was their intention to have the company 'delisted/liquidated this financial year'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">They made the point that the company had not traded for a number of years and did not have any assets as at the date of their signature, which was 25 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">A similar notice of intention signed by Gregory and Susanne Kimpton dated 21 March 2002, was also included with the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Balance sheets for each of KS and KPS were attached showing the only current assets under the heading 'Receivables' as the loans of $252,910 in the case of KS and $41,020 in the case of KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">15 A number of discussions followed between April and July 2002 in the course of which Mr Byrnes told the delegate that no action had been taken to prove the debts uncollectible but they were considered doubtful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He advised that as the debts had not been forgiven, KS and KPS would be liquidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">16 On 24 September 2002 a delegate for the Commission sent a letter to Mr and Mrs Kimpton informing them that as a result of advice about 'changes' to their financial details their service pensions had been increased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">That increase was to take effect from 4 April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The letter went on: 
 
 'Thank you for the information regarding your private companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It appears as though the money loaned by these companies has now been gifted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The value of which you and your spouse were attributable has now been recorded as gift from the 18 march 2002'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">(sic) 
 

Revised figures for the assets attributed to them through KS and KPS were shown as zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The previously attributed assets appear to have been treated as gifted from 18 March 2002 and so recorded as 'deprived assets' subject to a disposal preclusion period of five years from 18 March 2002 to 18 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The values assigned to the 'deprived assets' were $91,164 (KS) and $23,955 (KPS).</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The decision of 24 December 2002 was referred to in the Commission's Facts and Contentions in the Tribunal as 'the disposal decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">No application was made for review of either of the decisions of 6 February 2002 or 24 September 2002 within the relevant time limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">17 KS and KPS each entered into a members' voluntary winding up on 31 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Each had lodged declarations of solvency with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 17 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">KS recorded estimated realisable loans and advances of $252,160 and KPS $40,242.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">18 Guy Kimpton's wife, Julia, was appointed as the liquidator of KS and made payments thus:

19 KPS's liquidator was Gregory Kimpton's wife, Susanne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Her receipts and payments in the liquidation were as follows:

 The liquidations were completed on 30 April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">20 The Kimptons wrote to the delegate requesting that the amount of their service pensions be reviewed in light of the liquidations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">On 30 May 2003 they were sent a reassessment reducing their service pensions from 15 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Their interests in KS and KPS were removed from the record of their financial assets but the deprived assets mentioned earlier were retained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicants' motor car was assigned a net market value of $15,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This decision was referred to in the Commission's Facts and Contentions before the Tribunal as 'the liquidation decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">21 The Kimptons applied, on 11 July 2003, for a review of the pension assessment of 30 May 2003 on the ground that the value of the deprived assets in KPS and KS, on the basis of the distributions made by the liquidators, were $6,500 and $2 respectively and that the market value of the car was only $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The decision of 30 May 2003 was affirmed by a Senior Review Officer on 18 September 2003 save for a reduction in the value of the car, which was accepted, with effect from 10 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The applicants then applied, on 23 October 2003, to the Tribunal for review of the decision of 18 September 2003 so far as it related to their interests in KS &amp; KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">22 There was a Tribunal pre-hearing conference on 16 May 2004 at which the Commission agreed to reassess the service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">A delegate of the Commission determined on 4 August 2004, that the 'deprived asset' amounts relating to KS and KPS had been correctly included in the calculation of the Kimptons' service pensions from 18 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In his letter to the Kimptons of 4 August 2004 the delegate referred to four points made by the Kimptons' accountant, Mr Byrnes, on their behalf: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">At no time did they receive a determination dated 24 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">No control existed over the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">There was no diminishing of the income or assets of the companies upon which to apply the disposal of asset rule; and 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Both companies had not traded since at least 1997 and the only movement in financial statements were for administrative costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">

23 The delegate addressed the four points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He referred first to the attribution rules and to the attribution decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He noted that the attribution decision had considered the level of control that the Kimptons had over the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He referred then to the decision of 24 September 2002 and the removal of the loans from the balance sheets of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He said: 
 
 'These loans had both been removed from the balance sheets of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">As such, pursuant to s 52E of the VEA the delegate decided that you had given each of these loans as a gift and recorded the date given as 18 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' 
 

24 The delegate then applied what he called the 'deprived asset rules' in relation to the loans which they had given as a gift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He said: 
 
 'As you were 40% attributable stakeholders of Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd, 40% of the $252,910 loan was considered to be your own personal gift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">This amounted to a deprived asset value of $91,164.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 
 As you were 100% attributable stakeholders of Kununurra Poll Shorthorns Stud Pty Ltd, 100% of the $23,955 loan was considered to be your own personal gift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">This amounted to a deprived asset value of $23,955.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">' 
 

He then stated that as the loans had been gifted before 1 July 2002 they became subject to a disposal preclusion period of five years pursuant to s 45UT of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This meant that the value of the deprived assets would be deemed to remain in their pension assessment from 18 March 2002 for a five year period until 18 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">He pointed out that a letter notifying them of the decision of 24 September 2002 was sent by the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">No application for review of that decision was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">25 The delegate went on to refer to the effect of the attribution and disposal of asset provisions of the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">He discussed the liquidation process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He referred to the decision of 30 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">He then said: 
 
 'I have examined the information provided and I have decided not to change the deprived asset value in regard to Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Studs Pty Ltd because the original decision made in accordance with the VEA was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 The information contained in the Memorandum and Articles of Association for Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Studs Pty Ltd confirms the decisions to attribute 40% and 100% of the income and assets of the two companies to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">As such, the deprived asset value remains as $91,164 in relation to Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and $23,955 in relation to Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Studs Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">These values will be removed from your pension assessment on 18 March 2007, when the disposal preclusion period ceases to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">' 
 

26 On 1 December 2004 the delegate's decision was affirmed by a Senior Review Officer under s 57A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">After setting out the relevant provisions of the Act concerned with the disposition of assets he made the following brief findings: 
 
 'Under the Private Trust &amp; Companies legislation effective from 01 January 2002, if you diminish the income or assets of a private company, disposal of income and assets rules apply if adequate consideration is not received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The value of the disposed income or assets will remain assessable for 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">
 
 The 2002 Balance sheets for Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Studs Pty Ltd showed that assets held by the company previously had been wiped out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Based on this information, A Delegate of the Repatriation Commission determined on 4 August 2002 that Disposal of Assets rules should continue to apply as no supportive evidence had been provided to indicate that the disposed assets were irrecoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">' 
 

27 There is no record of any new review application having been filed in the Tribunal following this decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The hearing of the 2003 application proceeded as though it were an application for review of the decision made by the Senior Review Officer on 1 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">28 The Tribunal said that the hearing before it was conducted on the basis that the loan receivables of KS and KPS were 'doubtful' rather than 'forgiven' when Mr Byrnes told the Commission that the companies had a 'nil asset' position as at 18 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The liquidation of the companies reflected the collection of the loan receivables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">29 The Tribunal heard the application for review on 30 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The Kimptons were represented by their accountant, Mr Byrnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Commission was represented by Ms Maharaj, who has since been appointed Queens Counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On 20 September 2005 it set aside the decision under review and remitted the matter to the Commission for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">On 14 October 2005 the Commission filed a notice of appeal to the Court in the exercise of the Court's original jurisdiction under the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Statutory framework 
 
30 The provisions of the Act under which the assets and income of private trusts and companies can be attributed, for the purpose of means testing, to persons claiming service pensions came into effect on 1 January 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">They were introduced by the Social Security and Veterans Entitlements Legislative Amendments (Private Trusts and Private Companies --- Integrity of Means Testing) Act 2000 (Cth) (the amending Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The amending Act affected both the Social Security Act and the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The amendments to the Act were contained in Schedule 2 of the amending Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It created a new Division 11A of Part IIIB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The new Division is entitled 'Means test treatment of private companies and private trusts'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">31 Section 52ZN provides a simplified outline of the new Division thus: 
 
 
 ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This Division sets up a system for the attribution to individuals of the assets and income of private companies and private trusts (sections 52ZZKand 52ZZR).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Attribution starts on 1 January 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">For an asset or income to be attributed to an individual: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the company must be a designated private company or the trust must be a designated private trust (sections 52ZZA and 52ZZB);and 
 (b) the company must be a controlled private company in relation to the individual or the trust must be a controlled private trust in relation to the individual (sections 52ZZC and 52ZZH); and 
 (c) the individual must be an attributable stakeholder of the company or trust (section 52ZZJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">
 
 
 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A company or trust will be a controlled private trust or a controlled private company if the individual passes a control test or a source test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">An individual will not be an attributable stakeholder of a trust if the trust is a concessional primary production trust in relation to the individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The asset deprivation rules and the income deprivation rules are modified if attribution happens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">' 
 
 

32 Having regard to that outline and to undisputed findings by the Tribunal, it is not necessary for present purposes to set out all of the provisions of Div 11A which bear upon the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is sufficient to refer to s 52ZZR, which provides: 
 
 ' Attribution of assets 
 
 (1) For the purposes of this Act, if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) an individual is an attributable stakeholder of a company or trust at a particular time on or after 1 January 2002; and 
 (b) at that time, the company or trust owns a particular asset (whether alone or jointly or in common with another entity or entities); and 
 (c) if, at that time, that asset had been owned by the individual instead of by the company or trust, the value of the asset would not be required to be disregarded by any express provision of this Act; and 
 (d) at that time, the asset is not an excluded asset (see subsection (2)): 
 
 
 
 
 
 there is to be included in the value of the individual's assets an amount equal to the individual's asset attribution percentage of the value of the asset referred to in paragraph (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 Excluded assets
 
 (2) The Commission may, by writing, determine that, for the purposes of the application of subsection (1) to a specified individual and a particular company or trust, a specified asset is an excluded asset .</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">
 
 (3) A determination under subsection (2) has effect accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 (4) In making a determination under subsection (2), the Commission must comply with any relevant decision-making principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">' 
 
 

33 Section 52ZZZQ authorises the Commission to formulate principles known as 'decision-making principles' to be complied with by it in making decisions under various provisions of the Act which include s 52ZZR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">There were principles made on 20 December 2001 entitled 'The Veterans' Entitlements (Attribution of Assets) Principles 2001'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">They are said to 'set out decision-making principles with which the Commission must comply for the purposes of making a determination under subsection 52ZZR(2), 52ZZT(6) or 52ZZU(1) of the Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Only ss 5 and 6 of the Principles relate to determinations of excluded assets under s 52ZZR(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Those sections are concerned only with capital transferred to a company by a genuine investor who is not an attributable stakeholder of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">They set out the conditions under which such a transfer of capital is to be regarded as 'a genuine transfer of capital'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">They require the Commission to consider the extent to which capital transferred in accordance with those conditions should be determined to be an excluded asset in relation to an attributable stakeholder of the company or trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">34 Also relied upon on the appeal against the Tribunal's decision was s 52E which is an anti-avoidance provision directed to disposal of assets for the purpose of attracting or increasing benefits under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Section 52E provides: 
 
 ' Disposal of assets 
 
 
 
 (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person disposes of assets of the person if the person engages in a course of conduct that diminishes, directly or indirectly, the value of the person's assets and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person receives no consideration in money or money's worth for the diminution in the value of the person's assets; 
 (b) the person receives inadequate consideration in money or money's worth for the diminution in the value of the person's assets; or 
 (c) the Commission is satisfied that the purpose, or the dominant purpose, of the person in engaging in that course of conduct was: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) to obtain or enable the person's partner to obtain a service pension, income support supplement or a social security pension or benefit; or 
 (ii) to obtain or enable the person's partner to obtain a service pension, income support supplement or a social security pension or benefit at a higher rate than that which would otherwise have been payable; or 
 (iii) to ensure that the person or the person's partner would be eligible for benefits under Division 12 of this Part or fringe benefits under the Social Security Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">' 
 
 
 

 The Tribunal's reasons for decision 
 
35 The Tribunal set out the factual background referred to earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It made a number of findings which are not in dispute: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">KS and KPS satisfied the conditions set out in s 52ZZA to be designated private companies from 1 January 2002 until they were deregistered in April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At all material times the Kimptons and their three sons were the shareholders in KS and the Kimptons and their son, Gregory, were the shareholders in KPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Kimptons' sons were 'associates' as defined in ss 52ZQ and 52ZP so that, the Kimptons, met the 'control test' defined in s 52ZZC in respect of each of the companies from 1 January 2002 until their deregistration in April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">KS and KPS were controlled private companies in relation to the Kimptons during the period from 1 January 2002 until April 2003 for the purposes of s 52ZZJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Kimptons were 'attributable stakeholders' in KS and KPS for the purposes of s 52ZZR(1)(a) from 1 January 2002 until the companies were deregistered in April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The loan receivables of KS and KPS were assets owned by those companies for the purposes of s 52ZZR(1)(b) from 1 January 2002 until 11 April 2003 when the companies were divested of their assets in the course of the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Had the disputed loan receivables been owned by the applicants instead of by KS and KPS, their value would not be required to be disregarded by any express provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No question of the application of financial hardship rules on the ground that the loan receivables were unrealisable was raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">

36 The Tribunal said (at [50]): 
 
 'By 30 June 2002 the applicants were debtors as to $23,964 of the KPS loan balances, see para 20 of these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The effect of the notional exercise prescribed by s 52ZZR(1)(c) is that the loan balance owed by the applicants is eliminated because they are both debtors and creditors of that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Tribunal finds this fact relevant to the making of any written determination pursuant to s 52ZZR(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">' 
 

37 The Tribunal then referred to the Explanatory Memorandum for the amending Act and to statements which it considered relevant to the operation of Div 11A and, in particular, s 52ZZR(1)(d) and (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The statements relied upon from the Explanatory Memorandum were as follows: 
 
 'A test based on identifying control of a structure is justified on the grounds that the controller of a structure can be considered the de facto 'owner' of the structure's assets when he or she can use the assets for his or her own purposes or benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">In assessing whether an individual passes the control test, the interests of that individual and of the individual's 'associates' (as defined in the legislation) will be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">This prevents a person in relation to whom a trust or company is a controlled private trust or company from diluting his or her interest in a structure (for example, by issuing non-voting shares in a company).</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 ... 
 To ensure that people are not treated unfairly or affected unintentionally as a result of this measure, there are provisions in the attribution process for assets and/or income to be disregarded, if appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Legislative asset hardship provisions will also apply, as a protection for those asset-rich/income-poor people who genuinely require taxpayer support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">' 
 

38 The next four paragraphs of the reasons for decision were crucial to the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It is helpful to set them out in full: 
 
 '52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">By s 52ZZR(1)(d) an individual's asset attribution percentage of the value of excluded assets is not included in the value of the individual's assets for the purpose of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 
 53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">By s 52ZZR(2) the respondent has the discretion to make a written determination, for the purposes of application of s 52ZZR(1) to the applicants and KS and KPS, that the disputed loan receivables were excluded assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The Tribunal finds that the applicants would be treated unfairly as a result of Division IIA of the Act if the respondent were not to make such a determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 
 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The evidence of the formation and use of KS and KPS and of the nature of the shares held by the applicants and their sons in them, does not show an intention on the part of the applicants to use the disputed loan receivables for their own purposes or benefit or to dilute their interest in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">They were unrealisable assets in the hands of KS and KPS as, on the evidence, they would not reasonably be expected to sell them or use them as security for borrowing, s 5L(12).</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">In any event Division 11A looks through KS and KPS and extinguishes the disputed loan receivables to the extent that it attributes amounts to the applicants which they owe to KPS, c/f Repatriation Commission v Harrison 148 ALR 590 (sic) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In light of the above findings it is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the applicants' asset attribution percentage in relation to KPS and KS pursuant to s 52ZZJ or whether the liquidation of KS and KPS amounted to a disposal of assets pursuant to s 52E of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">' 
 

39 For the preceding reasons the Tribunal set aside the decision under review and remitted the matter to the Commission in accordance with a direction that the Commission determine that the loan of KS receivable from Mr Guy Kimpton and the loans of KPS receivable from the Kimptons and Mr and Mrs Gregory Kimpton were excluded assets for the purposes of s 52ZZR(1)(d) and that the Commission reassess the rate of service pensions with effect from 18 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The Tribunal's order 
 
40 The formal decision made by the Tribunal was in the following terms: 
 
 'The Tribunal sets aside the decision under review and remits this matter to the respondent for reconsideration in accordance with the following direction: that the respondent determine, in accordance with s 52ZZR(2) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, ('the Act') that the loan of Kimpton &amp; Sons Pty Ltd, that was receivable from Mr Guy Kimpton, and the loans of Kununurra Poll Shorthorn Pty Ltd, that were receivable from the applicants and Mr and Mrs Gregory Kimpton, are excluded assets for the purposes of s 52ZZR(1)(d) of the Act and that the respondent re-assess the applicants' rate of service pensions, with effect from 18 March 2002, in accordance with that determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">' 
 

 The grounds of appeal 
 
41 The grounds of appeal set out in the Commission's notice were as follows: 
 
 
 '4.1 The Tribunal erred in law in that it asked itself the wrong question regarding the exercise of the discretion under s52ZZR(2) of the VE Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
 
 4.2 The Tribunal failed to consider the Principles made pursuant to s52ZZZQ that it was bound to consider regarding the exercise of the discretion under s52ZZR(2) as required by s52ZZR(4) of the VE Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 
 4.3 The Tribunal misconceived the nature of the issues that it had to consider and the evidence before it on the issue of the exercise of the discretion under s52ZZR(2) of the VE Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">
 
 4.4 The Tribunal erred in law in considering that this was a proper matter for the exercise of the discretion under s52ZZR(2) of the VE Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">
 
 4.5 The Tribunal erred in law in that it denied the Applicant procedural fairness by exercising the discretion under s52ZZR(2) in favour of the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">' 
 
 

42 The first, third and fourth grounds were uninformative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The Commission's written submissions reduced to the following propositions: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The Tribunal failed to have regard to decision-making principles which had been made by the Commission under s 52ZZQ and which were applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s 52ZZR(2) to treat the relevant assets as excluded assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The Tribunal failed to accord the Commission procedural fairness in that it decided the matter by exercising the discretion under s 52ZZR(2), an option of which the Commission had no notice as it was neither advanced by the Kimptons nor raised by the Tribunal before the Tribunal made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Whether the Tribunal failed to comply with relevant decision-making principles 

43 Section 52ZZR(1) provides for the attribution to attributable stakeholders of assets owned by a controlled private company or controlled private trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The attribution involves the inclusion in the value of the individual's assets of an amount equal to the individual's asset attribution percentage of the value of the attributable asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is a necessary condition of the attribution for which s 52ZZR(1) provides that '... the asset is not an excluded asset ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">An asset becomes an excluded asset by the making of a determination to that effect under s 52ZZR(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">44 The discretion conferred upon the Commission by s 52ZZR(2) has the following elements and constraints: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">It must be in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It must identify a specified asset and determine that it is an excluded asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The determination is to be made for the purposes of the application of subs (1) to a specified individual and a particular company or trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The Commission, in making the determination, must comply with any relevant decision-making principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">

45 The discretion, not otherwise confined, is nevertheless to be exercised for the purposes of the legislative scheme of which it forms part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">That scheme, which provides for the means testing of benefits payable under the Act, is located in a statute described in its long title as: 
 
 'An Act to provide for the payment of pensions and other benefits to, and to provide medical and other treatment for, veterans and certain other persons, and for other purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' 
 

It is ultimately a beneficial statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">46 The novelty and generality of the provisions of Div 11A raise the possibility of unfair and unintended consequences in the application of its provisions to people claiming or in receipt of service pensions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The power under s 52ZZR(2) to determine that assets, otherwise attributable to an individual, should be excluded assets is provided to avoid such cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Its generality makes that purpose apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">That purpose is also reflected in the passage quoted by the Tribunal from the Explanatory Memorandum which refers to the object of the relieving provisions in the amending Act as '... to ensure that people are not treated unfairly or affected unintentionally as a result of this measure'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">47 The power conferred by s 52ZZR(2) allows for flexibility of response to the great variety of circumstances that may present for decision by the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">At the same time the exercise of the power should be consistent across similar cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The ability of the Commission to promulgate decision-making principles with which it must comply in the exercise of its discretion enables the development of consistent approaches to like cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">As the experience of the Commission in the application of s 52ZZR grows, classes of similar cases requiring similar treatment will no doubt emerge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Efficient and consistent decision-making in such cases will be assisted by the promulgation of decision-making principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It cannot however, by making such principles, fetter its discretion so as to limit it to a particular class of case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">That would amount to a confinement of the broad power which the Parliament has conferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The authority to make decision-making principles, which are a species of delegated legislation, does not sanction limitation by the Commission of the range of cases which it may consider for the purpose of determining whether otherwise attributable assets are to be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">48 Decision-making principles have been made by the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">They are the Veterans' Entitlements (Attribution of Assets) Principles 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Section 6 of those principles deals with determinations under s 52ZZR(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">That section applies '... if an individual (the Investor) who is not an attributable stakeholder of a company, makes a genuine transfer of capital to the company for shares in the company'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">It goes on to set out the conditions under which a transfer of capital will be regarded as a genuine transfer of capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It is not in dispute that this principle has no application to the treatment of the loans receivable by KS and KPS as excluded assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">49 The argument advanced by the Commission seemed to amount to the proposition that the existing decision-making principles exhaustively define the circumstances in which an asset could be determined to be an excluded asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">If the principles had that effect they would, in my opinion, be unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">50 The Commission is required in making a determination under s 52ZZR(2) to 'comply with any relevant decision-making principles'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">There were no decision-making principles relevant to this case in existence at the time the Tribunal made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Standing as it did in the shoes of the Commission, it was free to exercise the discretion under s 52ZZR(2) in favour of the Kimptons subject to that exercise falling within the purposes of the legislative scheme of which it formed part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The Tribunal did not err by not referring to the decision-making principles relied upon by the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whether the Tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness to the Commission 
 
51 On the face of the grounds of appeal, it would seem that the Commission's complaint was that the Tribunal had resorted to the discretion under s 52ZZR(2) in making its decision when the possibility of the exercise of that discretion had never been advanced in the proceedings before it and never been flagged as a possibility by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">52 In its Statement of Facts and Contentions in the Tribunal, the Commission acknowledged that at the pre-hearing conference on 16 May 2004 '... the [Commission] agreed to consider the entire matter again'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It said: 
 
 'On 4 August 2004 a delegate made a new decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">' 
 

The Facts and Contentions filed by the Commission in the Tribunal were filed on 11 October 2004 and challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to review the decision of 4 August 2004 until it had been subject to internal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">That subsequently occurred on 1 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In par 23 of its Statement of Facts and Contentions in the Tribunal the Commission said: 
 
 
 'The respondent contends that internal review by the respondent of the decision dated 4 August 2004 would enable the Tribunal to reconsider the disposal of the companies' assets and the value assigned to the deprived assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">' 
 

In par 25 it identified, as the relevant disposal of assets, '... the removal of the loans from the balance sheets'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Nothing in the Statement of Facts and Contentions raised an argument that the liquidation process involved a diminution in the value of the applicants' shares in the companies for the purposes of s 52E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">53 In its written submissions to the Tribunal in March 2005, the Commission submitted that there had been a disposal of assets by the Kimptons within the meaning of s 52E of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">They had, it was said, allowed the distribution in the liquidation of the companies to occur in a manner which reduced the value of their shares in the companies in order to obtain pensions at higher rates than would otherwise be payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">This submission, it may be noted immediately, did not depend upon the application of any of the provisions of Div 11A relating to attribution of assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">For if the Commission's position in the Tribunal relied upon an imputed disposal of the Kimptons' shares for the purposes of s 52E by diminution of their value, there was absolutely no need to refer to any provisions relating to attribution of assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Counsel for the Commission acknowledged at the hearing of the appeal that '... the Commission shifted its position before the Tribunal, based on the expert's report and admitted that there was no gifting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The contention of the Commission was through the winding up process there was a diminution of the shares by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">' 
 
54 Notwithstanding this 'shifting of position', the Commission's submissions in the Tribunal under the heading 'Relevant Statutory Scheme' set out the provisions of Div 11A including s 52ZZR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Although s 52ZZS was expressly said not to be relevant, that disclaimer was not offered in respect of ss 52ZZA, 52ZZC, 52ZZJ and 52ZZR which were all reproduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">This was a recipe for confusion of the Commission's own making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">55 The Commission advanced the contention in its written submissions to the Tribunal that the purpose of the Kimptons in diminishing the value of their shares through the way in which the liquidations of the two companies were effected was to obtain a pension at a higher rate than would otherwise be payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The Commission submitted that there had been a disposal of assets within the meaning of s 52E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The submission, reflecting as it did a 'shifting of position', was strikingly at odds with the Facts and Contentions filed earlier on behalf of the Commission and the entire course of decision making which the Commission had taken up to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The decision of 4 August 2004 depended upon the application of the attribution provisions to the company loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The removal of those loans from the balance sheet was treated as a gifting of an attributed asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">There was no mention of the diminution in the value of the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The decision of 1 December 2004, which was that under review by the Tribunal, affirmed the decision of 4 August 2004 and patently upon the same basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">56 In her oral submissions to this Court, senior counsel for the Commission referred to a report from Mr Langridge of Deloitte Touche Tomatsu which was before the Tribunal and which the Commission had relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">That report said, inter alia, that the effect of the way in which the companies had been wound up and distributions made was to diminish the value of the Kimptons' shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Whether that is properly based in law is a question which it is not necessary, for present purposes, to decide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">57 There was no finding of fact from the Tribunal about that aspect of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The grounds of appeal do not raise any complaint that the Tribunal failed to deal with the alleged diminution in the value of the shares and the effect upon that of s 52E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">That failure does not raise a question of natural justice even though I accept that the transcript of proceedings in the Tribunal disclose that the issue was before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">58 On this limb of the challenge to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion under s 52ZZR(2) the Court is concerned simply with the question whether the Tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">No separate complaint is made about the exercise of its discretion apart from its alleged failure to comply with relevant decision making principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">59 It is a necessary condition of attribution of assets under s 52ZZR(1) that at the relevant time the asset is not an excluded asset (s 52ZZR(1)(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">This requires positive consideration of the satisfaction of that condition by the relevant decision maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">That requires a positive consideration by the relevant decision maker whether it should make a determination under s 52ZZR(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It is to be noted that the nature of the determination under s 52ZZR(2) is not generic or applicable to a class of assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It relates to the application of subs (1) '... to a specified individual and a particular company or trust'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">It also relates to 'a specified asset'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">60 The matter was properly before the Tribunal albeit in a somewhat confusing context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It was invited, in light of the Commission's own written submissions, to consider the application of s 52ZZR(1)(d) and therefore s 52ZZR(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">It was open to the Commission to put submissions to the Tribunal touching that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It had set out the relevant provisions, including s 52ZZR(2) as relevant to the Tribunal's decision making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The principal consequence of which the Commission complained was that it did not have the opportunity to address the Tribunal about the relevant decision making principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">As I have already observed, there were no relevant decision-making principles with which the Tribunal was required to comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">61 In my opinion, for the preceding reasons, the ground based on breach of procedural fairness has not been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The Tribunal erred in law 
 
62 Despite my findings adverse to the Commission, it is clear that the Tribunal process has miscarried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The Tribunal failed to consider a significant question put to it, namely whether there was an imputed disposal of the assets being the company shares held by the Kimptons by reason of the way in which the winding up process was conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">If the Tribunal decision and order is left as it is, it is at least arguable that it will still be open to the Commission to make a finding adverse to the Kimptons on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">That may lead to another Tribunal review and further protraction of this already prolonged process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">63 In my opinion the Kimptons have succeeded on the appeal in relation to the grounds advanced by the Commission and they should have the costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">I am concerned, however, to ensure that they are exposed to as little further litigation as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">I will therefore give leave to the Commission to amend its notice of appeal by raising as a new ground the Tribunal's failure to deal with the question which was put before it, namely the application of s 52E to the alleged diminution in the value of the shares held by the Kimptons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The remitter to the Tribunal will be dependent upon that amendment being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Otherwise the application will stand dismissed and the matter will have to be reconsidered by the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">64 It is my hope that the parties may be able to reach an accommodation without any further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">However these orders should provide a formal framework within which any such accommodation can be discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I certify that the preceding sixty four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
