<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 ASP Holdings Ltd claims a statutory lien over the Boomerang 1, a cellular container vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The lien is for unpaid management services (the provision of the crew and technical management for the vessel's operation and maintenance) provided by ASP's agent to Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd, the demise charterer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The amount claimed is $910,872.26, but Pan Australia says much less is due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Pursuant to leave granted on 6 October 2006, ASP filed an action in rem against the vessel to execute the lien.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The owner, Jaymont Shipping Company Limited, has entered a conditional appearance and moves to set aside the action for want of jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Section 18 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) imposes two conditions for the right to proceed in rem on liabilities incurred by a demise charterer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The first is that when the cause of action arose, the person personally liable on the claim was the owner or charterer or the person in possession or control of the ship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is common ground that this condition is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The second condition is that when the action is commenced that person is the demise charterer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The contest is whether this condition is met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2 There is also an application by Pan Australia, which is in voluntary administration, that the leave granted to bring the action in rem be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It was said, correctly, that this application need only be considered if I were to find there is jurisdiction to bring the action in rem .</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The essential facts are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">By a bareboat charter dated 17 February 2006 Jaymont demised the vessel, then named "Sea Beta", to Pan Australia for thirty-six months with an option for a further twelve months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The charterparty was on the revised Baltic and International Marine Council form --- Barcom 2001 --- which I am told is in common use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The charter hire was $US15,000 per day pro rata for the initial term and $US16,200 per day pro rata for the option period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 Several provisions in the charterparty are important for the purposes of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Clause 11(a) provided that: "(a) The charterer shall pay hire due to the Owners punctually in accordance with the terms of this Charter in respect of which time shall be of the essence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">" Paragraph (b) went on to state that the hire was payable 30 running days in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Provision was made in cl 28 for the owners to "withdraw the Vessel from the service of the Charterers and terminate the Charter with immediate effect by a written notice to the Charterers" upon the occurrence of certain specific events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">One such event was where: "(i) the Charterers fail to pay hire in accordance with Clause 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">" If this were all, the owner would have an immediate right to withdraw the vessel on the failure to pay any instalment of hire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">But cl 28 contained what is commonly, but misleadingly, referred to as an "anti-technicality" proviso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The proviso was in these terms: "[W]here there is a failure to make punctual payment of hire due to oversight, negligence, errors or omissions on the part of the Charterers or their bankers, the Owners shall give the Charterers written notice [that they have ten days] in which to rectify the failure, and when so rectified within [ten] days following the Owners' notice, the payment shall stand as regular and punctual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Failure by the Charterers to pay hire within [that period] shall entitle the Owners to withdraw the Vessel from the service of the Charterers and terminate the Charter without further notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" 5 Clause 29 dealt with repossession in the event of termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It provided that on termination of the charter: "[T]he Owners shall have the right to repossess the Vessel from the Charterers at the current or next port of call, or at a port or place convenient to them ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Pending physical repossession of the Vessel ... the Charterers shall hold the Vessel as gratuitous bailee only to the Owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">" The clause also required the owners to arrange for an authorised representative to board the vessel as soon as reasonably practical following the termination and that the vessel would "be deemed to be repossessed by the Owners" upon its boarding by the owners' representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">6 An instalment of hire was due on 2 October 2006 but was not paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The instalment was not paid because Pan Australia was insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Indeed on 2 October 2006 the directors had appointed voluntary administrators to take control of the company's affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The following day one of the directors, Mr McLachlan, telephoned Mr Smith the general manager of Frontline Management (Bermuda) Ltd --- Frontline managed the vessel on behalf of Jaymont --- and told him of the appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Mr McLachlan explained that the hire due on 2 October had not been paid because his company did not have the funds and also because administrators had been appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">During the conversation Mr McLachlan acknowledged that the failure to pay was not for a reason covered by the "anti-technicality" proviso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">This concession could not bind the company in any way as the directors' powers had been suspended upon the appointment of administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 By letter dated 4 October 2006, Frontline attempted to terminate the charter on the owner's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The dispute between the parties is whether the attempt was effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The outcome of this dispute turns upon the answer to two questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">First, was the owner entitled to terminate the charter while Pan Australia was in administration?</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The answer to that question depends upon the proper construction to be given to several statutory provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Secondly, if the owner was entitled to terminate, did the 4 October letter effect termination?.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">8 On the first question I must refer to several sections in Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), the division dealing with voluntary administrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The appointment of an administrator establishes a moratorium on actions against the company and its property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Secured creditors cannot take steps to enforce their security: s 440B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Owners or lessors of property in the company's possession cannot take steps to take or recover possession of their property: s 440C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Unsecured creditors cannot bring or proceed with a claim against the company or its property: s 440D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">There are exceptions, but only one need be mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Section 441J provides that: "Nothing in s 437C [it is likely that the reference should have been to s 437D] or s 440C prevents a person from giving a notice to a company under an agreement relating to property that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">" 9 With these sections in mind Mr Horgan for ASP argued that the owner was forbidden from giving a notice that would determine the charter as that was prohibited by s 440C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He referred me to Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd v Sibec Developments Ltd [1992] 1 WLR 1253 to support the view that this was a reasonably arguable proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">10 I do not feel able to accept Mr Horgan's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The effect of s 440C is to prevent possession (actual or constructive) being taken of property in the hands of the administrators: Cinema Plus Ltd (Administrators Appointed) v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2000] NSWCA 195 ; (2000) 49 NSWLR 513, 545.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The notice determining the charter, even if it were effective, did not remove possession of the vessel from Pan Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In any event, it is plain that s 441J permits the giving of a notice of termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In Re Java 452 Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (1999) 32 ACSR 507, 515 Byrne J said in relation to a notice to determine a tenancy that the result of ss 440C and 441J was that "although the lessor may not recover possession, it may take steps to perfect its right to possession which right might be exercisable, if available, at the end of the administration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">This reasoning applies a fortiori to a charterparty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The English legislation considered in Barclays Mercantile, the Insolvency Act 1986 (UK), is in different terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">There is in any case nothing like s 441J in that statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">11 The answer to the first question, then, is that the owner was entitled to terminate the charterparty despite Pan being in administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">12 The second question, whether termination was effected, gives rise to several difficult issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The first is whether a notice of termination will bring the charter to an end or whether the charter remains on foot until the vessel is repossessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Unfortunately this is still a controversial topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In The Turakina (1998) 154 ALR 666, Tamberlin J held that a demise charter, under which possession and control of the ship had been given to the charterer, could not be terminated by notice alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">He said termination would only occur when the owner retook possession of the ship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In The Rangiora [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 36, the New Zealand High Court followed that decision, stating that the principle was a rule of the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Nonetheless, there is a view that the rule established in The Turakina may be avoided by careful drafting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v Ship 'Socofl Stream' [1999] FCA 1419 ; (1999) 95 FCR 403 it was held that the question whether a demise charter could be terminated without repossession depended upon the terms of the charterparty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The judge, Moore J, said (at 419): 
 
 "[I]t is necessary to ascertain from the terms of the charterparty whether the continuing physical possession of a vessel by the charterer (pending the taking of physical possession by the owner either by redelivery or some other means) is co-extensive with continuing possession and absolute control of the vessel of the type characteristic of a demise charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">" 
 

He went on to say (at 520) that it:
 
 "... is difficult to avoid a conclusion that if a charterparty expressly provided for its termination and the power to terminate was exercised, then the charterer ceased to be a demise charterer from the time of termination at least in the absence of provisions in the charterparty that suggested some other result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">" 
 
 
 13 Comity requires me to apply The Socofl Stream and thus hold that in the case of this charterparty, in particular because of cll 28 and 29, the charter can be terminated on written notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Clause 28 provides for termination by notice and cl 29 says that when the charter is at an end the charterer is the "gratuitous bailee" of the vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">14 If I may say so, this is a troubling conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It is troubling because until the owner actually withdraws the vessel not only does the charterer retain possession it still mans and supplies her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The problem becomes acute if the notice of termination is served while the vessel is at sea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Applying The Socofl Stream, she is not under demise while returning to port.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">If that be true it may surprise the owner to learn that the master now has ostensible authority to bind it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There is also the possibility that the owner may decide to retake possession at the next port of call or at a convenient port or place as contemplated by cl 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The result of the application of The Socofl Stream is that the owner has control of the vessel during the voyage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The true position is probably different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">15 I prefer the view that it is not until the vessel has been withdrawn that the demise comes to an end for it is only then that the charterer has lost exclusive possession of the vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">That the charterparty describes the charterer's possession before delivery as that of "gratuitous bailment" is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The real relation between the charterer and the vessel cannot be disguised by the use of an inapposite label or description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I appreciate, however, that others take a different view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">16 The next issue is whether the 4 October letter effected termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">At first this seemed to be comparatively simple but, on reflection, it does raise a difficult point of principle on which there appears to be no authority directly in point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">To understand the problem that has arisen it is necessary to set out the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It reads: 
 
 "Further to our telephone conversation today (Alasdair Smith/Mr Lyall McLachlan), we note you have failed to pay the October 2006 hire payment in respect of this vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This payment was due to be received by Owners on 2 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">We further note that you have today gone into administration and that you expect to be in a position to give us further information as to the company's plans in the next 48 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 This state of affairs is not acceptable, so please note as follows: 
 
 If, contrary to your advice today, your failure to remit this hire payment is covered by the anti technicality wording of Part II Clause 28(a)(1) i.e it is owing to oversight, negligence, errors or omissions on your part or on the part of your bankers, then we request you to rectify this within 10 banking days of the date of this letter i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">17 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">If you do not the Charter will terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">
 
 However, if your failure to remit hire does not fall within the anti technicality wording then you should consider this letter as immediate notice of termination of the Charter in accordance with Part II Clause 28(a)(1) of the Charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 Please confirm your position by return and should you wish to allege (contrary to your advice today) that your failure to remit the October 2006 hire is due to oversight, negligence, errors or omissions, then we request you to provide us with the reason why this has occurred, a copy of your instructions to your bank to pay and confirmation that this will be rectified by 17 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">
 
 Owners reserve all their rights including, but without limitation, the right to draw down on the Letter of Credit dated 20 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 We look forward to hearing from you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">" 
 
 
 17 I make the following observations about the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The first paragraph refers to the conversation during which Mr Smith was advised that the October hire had not been paid because of the lack of funds and of the appointment of the administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Mr Smith was also told that the "anti-technicality" proviso did not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In those circumstances it is difficult to understand why it was necessary to include the third paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">My guess is that Frontline wanted to guard against even the remotest possibility that the owner would be accused of repudiating the charterparty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">18 The owner contends that the fourth paragraph constitutes the notice of termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">ASP says that when regard is had to the entirety of the letter that paragraph could not stand as a notice of termination for it is neither clear nor unequivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In this regard the parties accept that under English law, which is the governing law, a notice of termination must clearly and unambiguously indicate that the owner has decided to terminate the charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In The Aegnoussiotis [1977] 1 Lloyd's Rep 268, Donaldson J said (at 275): "No particular form of words or notice is required [to terminate a charter], but the charterers must be informed that the owner is treating the non-payment of hire as having terminated the charterparty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">" Although notice of termination may be informal, what is required is "an unequivocal act or statement [by the owner] communicated to [the charterer] showing that [the owner intends to terminate the charter]": The Mihalios Xilas [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 303, 307 per Lord Diplock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Put rather more simply, the owner must make plain his decision to terminate the charter, not to lawyers but to the person who is to act on the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">19 Frontline's letter is plainly equivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It purports to cover two options but commits to neither.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">On one hand, it demands payment within ten days under threat of termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">On the other hand, it seeks to terminate the charter with immediate effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The charterer is required to determine which of the options applies by reference to the application of the "anti-technicality" proviso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">20 On reading the letter my initial impression was that it was ineffective for lack of clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It also read as if the owner was uncertain whether it was entitled to terminate the charter and was putting the onus on the charterer to make that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This seemed to me to offend against a principle of primary importance in all commercial transactions, namely that the parties must know where they stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">This could hardly be achieved by a conditional termination of the kind employed here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">21 I have reflected further on the letter, reviewing it in the light of several cases that I came across since reserving my decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">They are cases in which it had been held that a notice to quit was not invalid simply because an aspect was uncertain, provided it could be presumed that the tenant knew the facts, and sometimes the relevant law, which would render the notice certain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">These cases are not on all fours with the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In each the landlord expressed a clear intention to terminate the tenancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The lack of clarity concerned the date on which the termination was to take effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The date was not specified in the notice, but a formula to ascertain the date was provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In some cases the formula was deficient and others it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The cases are of assistance here as regards whether, and if so in what circumstances, a termination notice may legitimately require the recipient to have regard to facts and circumstances outside the four corners of the notice to clear up any uncertainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">I need only mention three of the cases to illustrate the principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">22 The first case is P Phipps and Company (Northampton and Towcester Breweries) Ltd v Rogers [1925] 1 KB 14 which, if I may say so, is the high watermark of this line of authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The case concerned a yearly tenancy of a public house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Either party could determine the tenancy "upon giving to the other of three months' previous notice in writing of his or her intention to do so expiring on any one of the days appointed as special transfer sessions by the justices for the district in which the premises are situate..." The landlord gave the tenant a notice to quit which read: "We do hereby give you notice to quit and deliver up to us (or such other person as we may appoint) on the earliest day your tenancy can legally be terminated by valid notice to quit given to you by us at the date of the service hereof ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The notice was declared invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Bankes LJ said (at 20) that: "It is not necessary that a notice should be clear and unambiguous in expressed terms provided it can be rendered clear and unambiguous by the application of the maxim 'Id certum est quod certum reddi potest'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">['That is sufficiently certain which can be made certain'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">] There are many decided cases in the books where the Courts have imputed to the tenant knowledge which, when applied to the notice to quit served upon him, renders clear what would without that knowledge have been neither clear nor unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">" Bankes LJ, however, said that he was not prepared to impute or attribute to the tenant the knowledge of the facts or of the law that was required to enable the tenant to determine the day upon which the tenancy would come to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The situation was that several difficult construction questions and questions of fact had to be sorted out before the notice could be rendered certain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Among the points that needed to be resolved was whether the reference to "three months" meant three calendar months or three lunar months; whether an annual licensing meeting was or was not a special transfer session; and when the special transfer sessions were in fact going to be "held".</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Bankes LJ was unwilling to extend the maxim to embrace such a complex enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Atkin LJ rejected the notice on similar grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">He said (at 28): "But it appears to me to defeat the whole object of notice to leave the date to be ascertained by the tenant as a problem not of fact but of law ... A tenant receiving such a notice might have to consult his solicitor, who might have to consult counsel, who might have to advise an application to the Court for a declaration by action or summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">" Scrutton LJ was in dissent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">He was of opinion that a long-settled line of authorities had treated landlords and tenants as both knowing the law and had assumed that the tenant must know the necessary facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This, he said, bound him to conclude that the notice was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">23 The second case is Addis v Burrows [1948] 1 KB 444.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">There premises were let on a yearly tenancy "until the tenancy be determined at the end of the first or any subsequent year by one of the parties giving to the other of them six calendar months previous notice in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">" On the face of the tenancy agreement the period of the tenancy was from 1 January 1944 to 30 June 1945, not a term of one year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The lessors served a notice to quit on 28 June 1945.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The notice required the tenant to quit "at the expiration of the year of your tenancy which will expire next after the end of one half year from the service of this notice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The Court of Appeal decided that the tenancy granted was for eighteen months and thereafter on a yearly tenancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">It also held that the notice to quit was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Evershed LJ dealt with the sufficiency of the notice in a lengthy passage between pages 452-456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He said (at 453) that that notice "puts plainly on the tenant the obligation of ascertaining the date meant by the form of words used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Prima facie, the problem is not very difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As [Lord Greene MR] observed during the argument, the tenant requires for its solution two things only, a modern calendar and the tenancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Armed with those two things he asks himself first: When was this notice served on me?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">... [H]e is next required to find out when one half year ends after the service of the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">... [T]hen only remains the question: when does the year of his tenancy current on December 29, 1945, come to an end?</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is true that involves the interpretation of the tenancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">But, if I am right in the view which I have expressed, he should have no great difficulty in answering that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">" Evershed LJ distinguished Phipps v Rogers .</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">He said (at 455) of that case that there was "an accumulation of difficulties provided by the joint effect of the language of the tenancy agreement and the very unusual form of the notice to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">" Later (also at 455) he pointed out that the court had come "to the conclusion that the tenant was involved in so many difficulties that there was a failure on the landlord's part either to give a certain date or to supply the tenant with a formula from which certainty could be ascertained and that, therefore, the notice was not good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">" By way of contrast, as regards the case before the court the judge said that any ambiguity was capable of a clear answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">24 Asquith LJ delivered a short judgment in which he pointed out, at 457, that in Phipps v Rogers it was observed that "each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances" and that "the circumstances there were that the tenant was forced by the form of notice to answer questions both of law and fact interlocked with each other and calling for a much more complex calculus than anything involved in the [instant] case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">" The other judge, Lord Greene MR, also put Phipps v Rogers to one side as being a difficult case to understand, observing, at 458, that the difficulties presented to the tenant in that case were difficulties of construction and difficulties of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">He rejected the suggestion that a termination notice giving rise to a difficult question of construction was necessarily invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">25 The last case is Allam &amp; Co Ltd v Europa Poster Services Ltd [1968] 1 WLR 638.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I need not go into the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">I cite the case for the observation by Buckley J who looked closely at Phipps v Rogers and Addis v Burrows and (at 652) said this: "No doubt if those cases are both good law, as I must assume that they are, the question of the validity of the notice, the interpretation of which involves some question of law, must become a question of degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">There must be cases which, because of the difficulty or complexity of the case, fall within the principle of Phipps v Rogers .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">There must be others which, notwithstanding that some question of law arises, because of the simplicity or comparative simplicity of the problem fall within Addis v Burrows .</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">" 26 The cases appear to me to establish the following propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">A notice to quit will not necessarily be invalid if the date upon which the tenancy is to determine is not specified in terms but the tenant is informed of the means by which the date can be ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">If the means is a reference to facts which the tenant is deemed to know that will make good the deficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">If the facts cannot be imputed, in very limited circumstances it may be possible to have regard to facts which the tenant can easily discover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Even if some interpretation of a document is required that may suffice, provided the construction does not raise any difficult point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">27 Unfortunately there is no bright line test by reference to which a notice can be held good or bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It is a question of degree in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">On any view, however, there must be some measure of restraint regarding the extent to which the tenant can be asked to travel outside the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I mean by this that an uncertain notice could not be made good by some open-ended enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Further, in each case the enquiry must be objective; regard is to be had to external facts which the tenant is deemed to know (constructive knowledge) or to facts which he is required to discover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The court does not enquire into a tenant's actual knowledge of the material facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">I note that in none of the notice to quit cases was the judge interested in discovering what the tenant actually knew or what he thought of any of the construction questions that arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The focus of attention, correctly in my view, was the notice itself: was it good or bad in an objective sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Anyway, if a subjective enquiry were permissible there would be no end to the litigation that would ensue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Moreover, if the validity of a notice depended upon the actual state of knowledge of a particular tenant the consequence would be startling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The clever tenant with the knowledge of an amateur lawyer would always be evicted but his average neighbour would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">28 In my opinion the foregoing principles can be applied to other kinds of notices, including those that determine charters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Nothing said in the cases suggests that the principles are confined to notices to quit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">29 I am now in a position where I can deal with the validity of Frontline's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The view I have come to is that it is not an effective notice to terminate the charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">First, it does not state that it is the owner's intention to bring the charter to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The letter indicates that when written the owner did not know whether the charter could be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">It had not formed the view --- or at last not had stated that it was of the view --- that there had been a breach of the charterparty which gave rise to a right to terminate under cl 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The reality is that the owner was hedging his bets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Second, and this is perhaps no more than an expansion of the first point, with this letter the owner left it to the charterer to determine whether the owner could bring the charter to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">That is the only sense I can give to the fifth paragraph --- "Please confirm your [the charterer's] position by return".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The charterer was being asked to advise whether in its opinion the "anti-technicality" proviso applied and its decision would then dictate whether the charter was over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">This is an impermissible reversal of roles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It was for the owner to decide whether there had been a breach that entitled it to terminate the charter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Third, even if the letter did constitute a statement that the owner elected to terminate the charter and the only issue was whether the decision had been conveyed with sufficient clarity, the owner is in difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">That is, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the notice is uncertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Often times it will be impossible for the charterer to determine whether the "anti-technicality" proviso applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">For one thing, difficult questions of construction can arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">What precisely is meant by "oversight", "negligence", "errors" or "omissions"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">By way of example, is the word "negligence" used in its common law meaning or does it mean "careless"; is "error" confined to errors of fact or does it include errors of law?</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">For another thing, it is easy to imagine circumstances in which the application of the proviso to the facts of a particular case will yield no clear answer to the question --- Does the proviso apply?</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">To my mind it is clear that this is not a form of notice where the equivocation can be cured by what a charterer is deemed to know or is required to find out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The letter is clever but it is a bad notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">30 For completeness I should say that even if it were permissible to look beyond the form of the notice and the presumed knowledge of the charterer and test the validity of the notice by reference to its actual knowledge, there is still a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Frontline had been told by Pan Australia that the reason for the non-payment was lack of funds and that it was not due to any oversight, negligence, error or omission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Despite this, the notice from Frontline left open the possibility that the proviso applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">This would indicate to Pan Australia that some doubt remained in the mind of the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">That is, the form of the notice was likely to create doubt, if none already existed, in the mind of the charterer as to whether the proviso applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">This unsatisfactory state of affairs is sufficient to hold the notice bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">31 The result is that the charterparty was on foot when the action in rem was commenced and so there was jurisdiction to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">It is therefore necessary to decide whether I should revoke the order by which leave was granted to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">For this purpose I need to recount some procedural history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">On 6 October 2006 the plaintiff applied under s 440D(1)(b) of the Corporations Act for leave to commence the action against the vessel and to apply in that action for its arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The application was brought on without notice to Pan Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">There was evidence that if notice of the application were given the owner might take steps to determine the charter if it were still on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">In that event an action in rem could not be brought and ASP would be left without security for its debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">32 In those circumstances I granted leave to commence the action but on ASP's undertaking that if the order granting leave was revoked ASP would discontinue the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">I reserved to Pan Australia, its administrators and any other person that may be affected, liberty to apply to vary or revoke the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">This is how Pan Australia comes before me on its present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">33 The general purpose of the moratorium provisions to which I have referred is to prevent outside intervention that could jeopardise the continuation of the company's business during its administration: National Australia Bank Ltd v King (2003) 45 ACSR 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">By keeping outsiders at bay there is greater likelihood that the objects of Pt 5.3A will be achieved: Re Ansett; Intrepid Aviation Partners VII LLC v Ansett Australia Ltd [2001] FCA 1360 ; (2001) 115 FCR 175.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Those objects are to maximise the chances of the company or as much as possible of its business continuing in existence and, if that is not possible, to achieve a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company: see s 435A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">34 Holding those objects in mind, I am nonetheless of the view that the leave order should not be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Shortly after their appointment the administrators decided that they did not wish to retain the vessel and wrote to the owner advising that the vessel would be redelivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Thus, the administrator cannot say --- indeed they do not say --- that the removal of the vessel from their control by its arrest will impede the administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">35 The administrators seek the revocation because they have a potential buyer for the business and the sale may not go ahead unless the buyer is able to charter the vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">They also say that if the action in rem remains on foot the owner will incur legal costs that will be passed on to the company in administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I think there is little substance in the first point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">If the vessel is arrested the owner will put up security and obtain its release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">That will happen quickly, as it always does with a vessel that can easily be demised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">There is some substance to the second point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">I accept the owner will incur some costs in sorting out the quantum of ASP's claim and a portion of the costs will be payable by Pan Australia, leaving less for the other unsecured creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">But the costs will not be excessive, in my opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Anyway, I am of opinion that the interests of the general body of unsecured creditors should be subordinated to those of ASP whose claim over the vessel is proprietary in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">See also in relation to a similar application: Morris v Ship Kiama (Mubum) (1998) 16 ACLC 945.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">36 For the foregoing reasons, I will make orders that Jaymont's motion be dismissed with costs and Pan Australia's application be dismissed but with no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">There will also be an order that ASP have leave to apply in proceeding no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">VID 1099 of 2006 for the arrest of the vessel.</sentence>
