<sentence id="s0">
 
1 By a notice of appeal filed 11 July 2007 the appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Emmett delivered on 29 June 2007 dismissing with costs an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 30 January 2007 by which the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to refuse the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellant has appeared in person this morning, supported by an interpreter, and in the course of making some observations in support of the appeal, the appellant expressed concern that the Tribunal did not seem to appreciate that he had been injured in the course of an industrial workplace accident which I will mention in more detail shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant also expressed concern that the Tribunal did not believe him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His concern is that he was, in fact, telling the truth to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant also relies upon a question of inconsistency in evidence before the Tribunal and complains that there was no inconsistency because his evidence was misunderstood by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">However, the appellant reinforces that contention by saying that, "What I said was true" therefore, 'I must have been misunderstood'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It can be seen therefore that in simple terms the appellant is concerned about the inconsistency really as a legacy of a concern that his evidence on the facts was not accepted as correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The notice of appeal before the Federal Court is in identical terms to the application made before Emmett FM and in truth therefore, the question alive before this Court is whether her Honour fell into error, the contended error being a failure to apprehend error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant arrived in Australia on 31 August 2005 and applied for a protection visa on 12 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 31 October 2005 the Minister's delegate refused to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 On 28 November 2005, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 18 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">However, that decision was set aside by consent by order of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 22 September 2006, the appellant appeared at a hearing before a differently constituted Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant's claims to a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason were set out in a statutory declaration annexed to his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These claims were confirmed by the appellant at the hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In essence, the appellant, a painter by trade, claimed to fear persecution from Chinese authorities arising out of protests in Fuqing in March 2005 which he claimed to have helped to organise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 The protests which the appellant claimed were made the subject of suppression actions by Chinese authorities on the ground of anti-government activities arose out of a failure of a construction company to compensate victims on a workplace accident in December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Emmett FM has recited some of the factual claims made by the appellant in these terms:
 
 
 (5) The applicant claimed that in early 2004 Mr Lin was contracted by the F2CC --- [which I will describe in these reasons as 'the company'] --- to undertake a large paint job in Fuqing mall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant stated that Mr Lin employed 30 painters for the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicant stated that under the contract for the job the company would be responsible for providing workers compensation insurance for Mr Lin's painters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The applicant stated that the working conditions were unsafe and no insurance was provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In December 2004 six painters fell and four were seriously injured and two died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicant claimed that an investigation by government officials and the company concluded that the accident was the fault of the painters and as a result, the company refused to pay compensation to the painters and their families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant claimed that the accident was due to inadequate scaffolding and work conditions provided by the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The applicant stated that he and Mr Lin believed that the investigators into the accident had been bribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 
 
 
 
 (6) In early March 2005 the applicant stated that he and Mr Lin organised a petition to protest over the accident and the company's inaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicant claimed that the protests grew from about 40 to 50 people to about 400 to 500 people and had the effect of significantly disrupting construction of the Fuqing mall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 
 
 
 
 (7) The applicant claimed that at the end of March 2005 police were sent in to suppress the protests resulting in the arrest of Mr Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The applicant claimed that he escaped into hiding with a friend in Xiamen city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 
 
 

6 The factual background is elaborated further but these particulars set out the contention in relation to the incident itself and the insurance claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">7 The Tribunal accepted that the contract provided that the company was responsible for work safety and insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal also accepted that an accident occurred in December 2004 in which two painters were killed and four injured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal further accepted that the appellant himself seriously injured his legs and ankles in the accident and spent a period of eight months recovering in two hospitals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">While the Tribunal accepted that an investigation was held into the accident it did not accept the appellant's claims that officials failed to investigate properly or were bribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal found that the company failed to pay compensation notwithstanding a prima facie case of liability to do so under the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal rejected the appellant's claims that he asked Mr Lin to arrange insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">8 The Tribunal reached a number of conclusions and I will briefly recite several of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">They are these:
 
 It [the Tribunal] does not accept as credible his [the appellant's] earlier claims that during this period he participated in seven demonstrations and in the preparation of written leaflets and petitions demanding compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 The Tribunal accepts that with the help of relatives and friends he may have assisted with organising the protests from his hospital bed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, it does not accept that this led to him being a person of interest to the authorities because he was Mr Lin's deputy and that his protests against the company were regarded as anti-government as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 The Tribunal has given the applicant the benefit of the doubt that his master Mr Lin was arrested in April 2005, although there is no definite evidence apart from the applicant's assertion that it was because he organised the demonstration for compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Tribunal has noted that the applicant's evidence in regard to Mr Lin's role in providing insurance for the painters was conflicted and he may have been arrested because of the compensation issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 

9 The Tribunal then sets out four elements of a conflict in the evidence of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal then concludes that in view of these contradictions in the appellant's evidence, the Tribunal does not believe him to be a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In consequence, the Tribunal concluded that although the appellant has claimed that he fears arrest on his return to the People's Republic of China because he was regarded by the authorities as Mr Lin's deputy, the Tribunal placed weight on the fact that he was not arrested and was allowed to leave China without any difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">10 The Tribunal further concluded that it did not accept the appellant's claim that he was forced to flee China and that protection from authorities was his reason for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal further concluded that it did not accept that he played a significant if any role in organising the seven protests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal further concluded that in view of the appellant's limited education and functional illiteracy, the Tribunal did not believe that the appellant had sufficient leadership skills to allow him to emerge as a person of concern to the authorities either now or in the foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">11 The Tribunal concluded that the appellant gave evidence to the Tribunal that the protests over compensation ended in March 2005 and there was no indication from him that he would continue to pursue his claims should he return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As a result, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant raised essentially three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The first was that an error of law occurred in the Tribunal's decision-making giving rise to a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That ground is not supported by any further elaboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">12 The second ground is that there was a procedural error in the Tribunal's decision and that error rests upon a failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with its obligations under s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (as amended).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">That contention rests upon a proposition that the Tribunal identified four grounds upon which there was a conflict in the evidence of the appellant and that in reaching a conclusion as to conflicting evidence (and therefore a finding about the appellant's credibility), the Tribunal failed to comprehend and understand what exactly was put to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">13 The further ground is one of bias on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">14 As to the ground based upon the conflicting evidence, Emmett FM noted at [32] of her Honour's reasons a section of transcript which led the Tribunal to express its concern about inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In reliance upon the material and that section of transcript, the Tribunal formed its conclusionary view about the credit of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">At [36] of her Honour's reasons, her Honour notes that the findings of fact made by the Tribunal were open to it and the appellant in essence seeks to challenge those findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">15 Those conclusions on the part of her Honour resonate with what has been said this morning by the appellant because in oral submissions with the assistance of an interpreter, the appellant essentially contests the findings of fact expressing concern that statements which he believed to be true were found, not to be true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">That conclusion was plainly open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">As her Honour notes at [39] of her reasons: 
 
 To the extent that the applicant contends that the contradictions or the Tribunal's finding of contradiction should have been put to the applicant for comment, such a contention is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Tribunal is doing no more than evaluating the evidence before it, summarising the applicant's evidence and identifying those aspects of the applicant's evidence that it found to be contradictory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">


 
16 I accept those observations as being plainly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 Accordingly, in relation to the first two grounds of jurisdictional error and procedural error, the appellant has not established those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The third ground raised before this Court, like the ground raised before her Honour, is a ground of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There are no proper particulars given of that allegation either, of course, as to actual bias or apprehended bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">An allegation of actual bias is a very serious matter and an allegation of apprehended bias is also serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It must be supported by proper particulars and proper evidence and cannot simply be made as a supplementary or additional ground unsupported by any material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Her Honour at [43] to [47] dealt with those contentions and I find no identified error in her Honour's reasoning on those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">18 One additional matter ought to be mentioned and that goes to an aspect of the contention both before this Court and before the Federal Magistrates Court that the Tribunal failed to understand the content or substance or thrust of the appellant's evidence before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">As I indicated earlier, that contention now seems to rest upon the notion that what the appellant said before the Tribunal was true and the Tribunal failed to recognise the truth of that evidence rather than a conclusion that the evidence must have been misunderstood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">I can find no basis for concluding that the evidence was misunderstood by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">There was an assessment of the evidence and a view was formed that there were conflicts in the evidence which led the Tribunal to the ultimate view that the evidence could not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">That view gave rise to the conclusion that the applicant before the Tribunal had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">That remains the position before this Court in the sense that no error of law has been demonstrated on the part of her Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Accordingly, the inevitable result must be that the appeal is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
