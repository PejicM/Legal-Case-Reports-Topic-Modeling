<sentence id="s0">
 There has been no appearance today by or on behalf of the Applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 26 May last year Dowsett J made an order that the Applicant show cause at the next directions hearing why the application should not be dismissed pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (Native Title Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It is a matter of record that the Applicants' solicitors, D. and G. Lawyers of Townsville, withdrew prior to a directions hearing last year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At that hearing there was no appearance by or on behalf of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">At that time I made an order that, pursuant to s 84D of the Native Title Act , the Deputy District Registrar Native Title, by letter, require the applicant to produce evidence of the authorisation of the claim for the purposes of s 61 of the Native Title Act on 27 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I directed that that letter be sent by prepaid post to each of the persons detailed in letters which were exhibits A, B and C to an affidavit of Susan Jane Gilmore filed on 29 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I directed that on or before Friday, 13 March 2009, any affidavits to be relied on by the State in respect of the show cause requirement be filed and served and that the Applicant show cause today why the application should not be dismissed pursuant to s 84D of the Act for want of authorisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I further directed that a copy of the order be sent by the Deputy District Registrar to the persons mentioned in the letters which are exhibits A, B and C in Ms Gilmore's affidavit to which I have previously referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The wider background to this case is that an application for the review of a decision by the Registrar not to register the claim was heard by Collier J on 16 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 29 April 2008, her Honour dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">So far as the registration position is concerned, there matters rest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Against that background, s 190F(6) permits the dismissal of an application if certain conditions precedent are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Those conditions precedent are set out in that subsection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They are: 
(i) that the application in issue has not been amended since consideration by the Registrar and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar; and
 
(ii) in the opinion of the court, there is no reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Applicants' absence from court today is eloquent in relation to whether there is any likelihood of the application in issue being amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The long and the short of it is, the application is one which has failed a registration test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Every opportunity has been given for the Applicants to amend the application or at least provide some hope, in a meaningful way, that an amendment is likely which would provide a basis for retention of the case in the Court's list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There is no basis for forming an opinion that this is anything other than a case which does not warrant the further expenditure of public funds in terms of judicial time and also in terms of the investment of public funds in a Respondent State considering the case and attending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">There are bases then upon which the application may be dismissed and should be dismissed under s 190F(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I canvassed the background to that particular provision in the legislation in a decision which I gave in another case: Christie George on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I shall not repeat what I there stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There is another basis upon which this application should be dismissed and it is one which ought not be forgotten.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That is there is a default of appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In fact, more than one, there are multiple defaults of appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Defaults of appearance, in themselves, provide a basis upon which an application may be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It is understandable that in some circumstances, for reasons about which a judge may be unaware, the State may wish, for its own particular reasons, not to move under s 190F(6) but rather prefer to see a dismissal occur in an appropriate case of the court's own motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Those same sentiments, with respect, do not apply where the practice and procedure of a court is not observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In the ordinary course of events, one might expect a respondent, particularly a public respondent, acting responsibly to move for dismissal in a case where there is an event of default in the ordinary practice and procedure of a court, as a model litigant would move in other cases involving the wider interests of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Be that as it may, there is then a basis in terms of default under the practice of the court as well as under s 190F(6) , for the dismissal of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The order that I make is that the application be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Associate:
 
 
Dated: 14 April 2009
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: No appearance by the Applicant 
 
 Solicitor for the First Respondent: Crown Solicitor of Queensland 
 
 Solicitor for the Second Respondent: There was no appearance for the Second Respondent 
 Date of Hearing: 27 March 2009 
 
 Date of Judgment: 27 March 2009
