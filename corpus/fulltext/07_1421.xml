 Introduction 
 
1 Investors in a registered management scheme commenced proceedings against the former directors of the company which was the responsible entity for the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They also seek leave to proceed against the company which is now in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The company was covered by a Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy during the relevant period and gave notice to its insurers of the claims against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The insurers have declined to provide indemnity relying upon an exclusion clause in the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The liquidator of the company is not prepared to contest the insurers' refusal to indemnify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The applicant investors now seek to join the insurers as respondents and to seek a declaration that they are liable to indemnify the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">That joinder is opposed largely on the basis that a declaration obtained by the applicant investors against the insurers would not legally prevent the insurers from contesting any claim for indemnity by the liquidator following a judgment against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">For the reasons that follow, I propose to allow the insurers to be joined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">As a consequence, I will also order in the related application in WAD 307 of 2006 that the applicants have leave to proceed against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Factual and procedural background 
 
2 Peter Cornelius Beekink, Hersh Solomon Majteles and Gregory Phillip Gaunt are former directors of Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd (KMF), formerly known as Australian Managed Funds Ltd. KMF is in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 27 October 2006 former investors in a scheme said to have been managed by KMF commenced proceedings against the three former directors, KMF itself and the liquidator of KMF (subsequently discontinued as against the liquidator).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Three days later, an application was filed in this Court seeking the leave of the Court under s 471B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) to begin and proceed with the action against KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Altogether there are eleven applicants, some of whom are corporations and some of whom are natural persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 In a substituted statement of claim, filed 20 February 2007, it is alleged that from 22 December 1999 KMF was the responsible entity for the Clifton Partners Finance Mortgage Scheme (the Scheme), a registered management scheme under ch 5C of the former Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Scheme involved making loans secured by mortgages over property and otherwise on terms and conditions specified by KMF from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is alleged that KMF appointed Knightsbridge Pty Ltd, which was formerly Clifton Partners Pty Ltd, as the custodian of the assets of the Scheme within the meaning of a Constitution and Compliance Plan lodged by KMF with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) under Ch 5C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Knightsbridge Pty Ltd was to act as KMF's agent in the management of the Scheme, the origination of loans and in ensuring compliance with the terms of any prospectus issued by KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It was also required to comply with the lawful directions of KMF and ensure compliance with the requirements of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Knightsbridge is still referred to in the pleading as Clifton Partners and will be so described in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">4 According to the substituted statement of claim, KMF had various duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It was required to exercise the care and diligence of a reasonable person in KMF's position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It had to act in the best interests of members of the Scheme and to comply with the Compliance Plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Duties of the directors were also pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These are duties of care and diligence, to act in the best interests of the members of the Scheme and to take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the Corporations Law and the Compliance Plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Section 601FD of the Corporations Law is pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicants also say that the directors had a common law duty of care to potential investors in the Scheme to ensure that they did not suffer economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">5 The first to fifth applicants say that on 14 February 2000 they were owed sums amounting to $650,000, forming part of an overall sum of $850,000 advanced to Fieldmont Holdings Pty Ltd (Fieldmont).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The remaining lender is not an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicants say the original loan was to have been repaid on or about 30 November 2000 and secured by a second registered mortgage over land owned by Fieldmont.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">They say that Clifton Partners recommended in February 2000 that they roll the existing loan over into an increased loan of $1.1 million secured by a new second mortgage over the land in their favour and in favour of new investors providing the additional advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This letter is said to have been an offer for subscription of securities of a corporation and, alternatively, an invitation to subscribe for securities within the meaning of s 1018 of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">KMF is said to have failed to lodge a prospectus in relation to the securities and to have contravened s 1018.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">6 Various representations are said to have been conveyed by Clifton Partners in its letter of 14 February 2000 to the first to fifth applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The representations are said to have related to the value of the land to be secured, the amount secured under the first registered mortgage, the Loan to Valuation ratio, the amount that would continue to be owed under the first registered mortgage and the absence of any reason to believe that it would be greater than $2.2 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">They are said to have been false and the basis of that falsity is pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">7 Clifton Partners also allegedly failed to inform the applicants that at the date of the offer, Fieldmont intended to increase the amount owing under the first registered mortgage to $2.7 million effective from the end of February 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Clifton Partners is said to have known that Fieldmont was, or had been, in default of its obligation to pay interest pursuant to a loan from the National Australia Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It allegedly failed to inform the applicants of those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The first to fifth applicants say that Clifton Partners engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive, contrary to s 995(2) of the Corporations Law and that they are entitled to recover loss or damage caused by that conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The remaining applicants plead misleading or deceptive conduct in respect of successive prospectuses issued on 11 February 2000, 13 March 2000, 11 May 2000 and 15 May 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8 The substituted statement of claim also alleges breaches by the directors of duties imposed on them by s 601FD of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">These relate to failure to provide or cause KMF to provide adequate training to staff members of Clifton Partners to ensure that they understood the requirements of the Corporations Law and the Compliance Plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">They are also said to have failed to monitor or review or cause KMF to monitor or review Clifton Partners' compliance systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">They failed to check or failed to cause KMF to check compliance by Clifton Partners with the Corporations Law and the Compliance Plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">They allegedly authorised Clifton Partners to originate loans and make offers for subscriptions or invitations to subscribe for interests in the Scheme without reference to them and to have signed various prospectuses without reference to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Other breaches of s 601FD are alleged, including particular breaches of that section by Mr Beekink, the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Each of the directors is also said to have been negligent in breach of his common law duties of care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">9 The first to fifth applicants say that each of the original investors, including themselves, discharged their existing second registered mortgage over the land and agreed to take an interest in the new registered mortgage securing $1.1 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">They say they did so in reliance upon the representations conveyed by the Clifton Partners' letter of 14 February 2000 and as a result of the breaches of the directors' duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">They say that by reason of those matters, they were not repaid their respective outstanding advances towards the original loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">They claim compensation under various provisions of the Corporations Law as it was in force prior to 1 March 2000 and, alternatively, under the corresponding provisions of the Act, they also claim damages and interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">10 On 30 March 2007, I dismissed a motion filed by the first to third respondents seeking to strike out the substituted statement of claim in relation to causes of action pleaded by the first to fifth applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">11 On 16 April 2007, the applicants filed a motion seeking the joinder of KMF's insurers, Employers Reinsurance Corporation and Suncorp Metway Insurance Ltd (the Insurers).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They also filed a minute of a proposed amended application and proposed amended substituted statement of claim naming the Insurers as sixth and seventh respondents respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The joinder is opposed by the Insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Written submissions were filed in relation to the motion and in the related application (in WAD 307/2006) for leave to proceed against KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Counsel for the applicants accepted that there was no point in seeking leave to proceed against KMF in the event that the joinder motion was dismissed and accepted that if that were the case the application for leave to proceed should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Oral argument on the motion for joinder of the Insurers proceeded on 28 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The position of KMF's insurers 
 
12 Affidavit evidence was filed in the application for leave to proceed against KMF which was relevant to and relied upon by the applicants in the joinder motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">13 On 21 November 2006, Dwyer Durack the solicitors for the applicants wrote to the solicitors for KMF's liquidator and asked for copies of documents indicating that KMF was insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">On 12 December 2006 the solicitors for KMF, Christensen Vaughan, wrote back advising that the liquidator had located records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It appeared that KMF held a professional indemnity policy which expired on 17 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Notice of a potential claim in respect of Fieldmont was given to the underwriter on 17 and 18 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The solicitors advised that there was no indication that indemnity was granted as a result of that notification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The liquidator had informed the underwriter of the existence of the current proceedings and requested the underwriter's advice as to indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The solicitors indicated that the liquidator lacked funds to contest any denial of indemnity by the underwriter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">14 The liquidator, Giovanni Carrello, had been appointed administrator of KMF on 20 February 2001 and was appointed administrator of a Deed of Company Arrangement on 15 June 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Following the termination of that deed he became liquidator of KMF on 8 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He said, in an affidavit sworn on 16 January 2007, that there were no funds available in the liquidation of KMF to meet the costs of the application for leave to proceed or these substantive proceedings or to pay any award of damages which might eventually be made in favour of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">He exhibited copies of statements of receipts and payments which he had lodged with ASIC in relation to KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He added that KMF has no assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Its business was essentially the management of registered and unregistered managed investment schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">15 On 13 December 2006 Mr Carrello had received a copy of an email from the Claims Manager of the underwriter, Dexta Corporation Pty Ltd (Dexta).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Claims Manager said that she was aware that Dexta had received several years before numerous papers in relation to Knightsbridge managed funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">She was not aware whether any of them could support a notification of claim or circumstance under the 1999-2000 policy in relation to the current proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">16 Mr Carrello said KMF lacked funds to contest any denial of indemnity on the part of Dexta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The insurers were identified as the proposed sixth and seventh respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Allens Arthur Robinson the solicitors for the underwriters, Dexta, wrote to the liquidator on 23 January 2007 saying: 
 
 Our client is considering whether the Insured is indemnified in respect of the above claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">We will contact you further as soon as possible in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">You should continue to act as a prudent uninsured unless advised to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">

17 On 6 March 2007 the Insurers' solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the liquidator confirming that their clients were denying indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">They relied upon an exclusion clause in the policy relating to any claim made against the insured directly or indirectly arising out of the non-repayment of any loan which was originated or managed by the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">They rejected submissions which had been made on behalf of the liquidator that the exclusion clause did not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It seems from the letter written by the Insurers' solicitors that the liquidator's solicitors had contended that the Insurers' interpretation of the exclusion clause deprived the policy of any effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">18 The Insurers' solicitors also referred to cl 3.3(c) of the policy which contained an exclusion in respect of dishonest or reckless acts directly or indirectly arising from any actual or alleged conduct with a reckless disregard for the consequences thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">They said that Mr Beekink of KMF had authorised Clifton Partners to sign documents that KMF had not reviewed and permitted documents to be sent to investors without them ever having been read by the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">If the insured had acted in a similar manner in respect of the loan the subject of the claim the exclusion contained in cl 3.3(c) of the policy would apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Further investigations would need to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The solicitors then said: 
 
 However, as indemnity is denied on other grounds, the Insurer is not currently relying on this clause, but reserves its rights to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">

19 Following the hearing on 28 August 2007 the solicitors for the applicants communicated with the solicitors for the liquidator inquiring whether the liquidator would agree to cross-claim against the Insurers if the applicants gave him an unconditional undertaking to indemnify him as to any court ordered costs made against him or against KMF in the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The offer of indemnity was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I note that the offer did not extend to the liquidator's costs of bringing such an action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The proposed claim against the sixth and seventh respondents 
 
20 On 13 April 2007 the applicants filed minutes of a proposed amended application and a proposed amended substituted statement of claim setting out the pleading and relief claimed against the Insurers if they were to be joined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The additional pleading is contained in [152] to [157] inclusive of the proposed amended substituted statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The applicants would allege that by a policy of insurance in writing dated 18 February 2000 the Insurers by their agent, Dexta, agreed, in consideration of the payment of the premium of $12,500 per annum, to provide indemnity to KMF subject to the terms of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">21 The proposed pleading would then set out relevant express terms of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The applicants would say that the Insurers agreed to indemnify KMF up to a limit of $5 million in respect of claims first made against KMF during the period of insurance defined to mean "4pm on 17 December 1999 to 4pm on 17 December 2001" and notified to the Insurers during that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The nature of the claims insured were claims "... arising from KMF's civil liability for breach of professional duty arising from any act, error or omission wherever or whenever committed or allegedly committed by KMF in the conduct of its business of responsible entity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Clause 1.1 of the policy was cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">22 The applicants also allege that the insurance policy covered KMF's legal liability for any act, error or omission committed by KMF in the conduct of its business of responsible entity by reason of any unintentional breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA), the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), the Fair Trading Act 1985 (Victoria) or similar legislation enacted by any State or Territory of Australia (cl 1.2.3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Reference was also made to the notice requirements of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">23 Paragraphs 154 to 157 of the proposed pleading would then read as follows: 
 
 
 154.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The applicants' claims the subject of these proceedings are deemed, by virtue of clause 5.2 of the Policy, to be a Claim, or alternatively Claims, within the meaning of the Policy, made during the period of insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">...
 
 155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The Applicants' claims herein arose from KMF's civil liability for breach of professional duty arising from acts, errors or omissions committed by KMF in the conduct of its business of responsible entity within the meaning of clause 1.1 of the Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">156.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Further and in the alternative, the Applicants' claims herein arose from KMF's legal liability for acts, errors or omissions committed by KMF in the conduct of its business of responsible entity, being unintentional, misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s 728(1)(a) and 995(2) of the former Corporations Law as pleaded in paragraphs 44, 45, 61(a), 76, 95 and 111 herein, such provisions being legislation enacted by any State or Territory of Australia similar to the Trade Practices Act , the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) or the Fair Trading Act 1985 (Victoria) within the meaning of clause 1.2.3 of the Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">157.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In the premises, the Sixth and Seventh Respondents are liable to indemnify KMF against the "Claim Costs" (as defined in the Policy) with respect to the claims of the Applicants, up to the limit of $5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 

24 The relief proposed to be claimed against the Insurers in the substituted application is a declaration in the following terms: 
 
 A declaration that the Sixth and Seventh Respondents are liable and obliged to indemnify the Fifth Respondent against the "Claim Costs" (as defined in the Policy) with respect to the claims of the Applicants herein up to the limit of $5 million in consequence of judgment being entered against the Fifth Respondent in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">

 The insurance policy 
 
25 The insurance policy names "Employers Reinsurance Corporation" and "Suncorp Metway Insurance Limited" as the Insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is entitled "Miscellaneous Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The insured is identified in a schedule to the policy as "Australian Managed Funds Limited".</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It is now known as KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Its professional business is described as "Responsible entity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The period of insurance is "From 4pm 17 th December 1999 To 4pm 17 December 2001".</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The limit of liability is $5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Employers Reinsurance carries 35% of the risk and Suncorp Metway carries 65%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">26 The insuring clauses appear in s 1 of the policy and include the following: 
 
 1.1 Breach of professional duty 
 We agree to indemnify You up to the Limit of Liability for the Claim Costs of a Claim first made against You during the Period of Insurance and notified to Us during the Period of Insurance arising from Your civil liability for breach of professional duty arising from any act, error or omission wherever or whenever committed or allegedly committed by You in the conduct of the Professional Business.</sentence>

 ... 


There are then set out the three heads of liability covered by the additional insuring clauses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The first relates to defamation (cl 1.2.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The second relates to unintentional infringement of intellectual property rights (cl 1.2.2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The third relates to the TPA and covers:

<sentence id="s124">

27 Exclusion clauses are set out in s 3 of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Clause 3.3 is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The relevant parts read:

 directly or indirectly arising from any actual or alleged:

<sentence id="s134">
 
 
 

 The rules relating to joinder 
 
30 The rules of Court invoked by the applicants in this case are O 6 rr 2, 4 and/or 8.</sentence>

 Statutory framework --- priority of third parties to insurance monies in a winding up 
 
31 The Corporations Act provides in s 562: 
 
 (1) Where a company is, under a contract of insurance (not being a contract of reinsurance) entered into before the relevant date, insured against liability to third parties, then, if such a liability is incurred by the company (whether before or after the relevant date) and an amount in respect of that liability has been or is received by the company or the liquidator from the insurer, the amount must, after deducting any expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount, be paid by the liquidator to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred to the extent necessary to discharge that liability, or any part of that liability remaining undischarged, in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in section 556.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">(2) If the liability of the insurer to the company is less than the liability of the company to the third party, subsection (1) does not limit the rights of the third party in respect of the balance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">(3) This section has effect notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">

 Statutory framework --- Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) 
 
32 Sections 21 , 22 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provide:

 Statutory framework --- Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) 
 
33 Section 51 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) provides for the rights of third parties to recover against an insurer:
 
 (1) Where:
 
 
 
 (a) the insured under a contract of liability insurance is liable in damages to a person (in this section called the third party );

 Whether joinder should be ordered 
 
34 The applicants assert causes of action against the insured company, KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It may be assumed that, subject to the grant of leave to proceed against the company, their causes of action would have a reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">But KMF has no money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">It may be assumed that it has a legal right to claim against the Insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">That right may or may not be of any value as the Insurers may have a good defence to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">But it is only through a successful claim against the Insurers that KMF would be able to meet any judgment against it in favour of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">KMF's liquidator has no interest in pursuing any claim against the Insurers even if indemnified against an adverse costs order by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Nor does he have the funds to defend the action against KMF if leave to bring such an action were to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">35 It is not disputed that the applicants, if they obtained a judgment against KMF, could not recover directly against the Insurers under s 51 of the Insurance Contracts Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Counsel for the Insurers accepts that this Court has power to join her clients for the purposes of the relief sought against them by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Her opposition to the joinder was on discretionary grounds.</sentence>

<sentence id="s163">36 The applicants assert no legal right or any cause of action against the Insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">But the want of a legal right or a cause of action is not a bar to the grant of declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It is, nevertheless, necessary that declaratory relief be sought in respect of a real question that is not abstract or hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It must be directed to the determination of a legal controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Moreover the party seeking the relief must have a real interest in raising it: Aussie Airlines Pty Ltd v Australian Airlines Ltd (1996) 139 ALR 663 per Lockhart J (Spender and Cooper JJ concurring) and authorities there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">37 The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia took that general approach to a factual situation similar to the present in JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (In Liquidation) v Alan Bond (1993) 59 SASR 432.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Plaintiff companies in liquidation sued three of their former directors alleging breaches of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The directors were insured in respect of any wrongful act committed in their capacity as directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">One of them was bankrupt and the other two had left the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The trustee in bankruptcy had agreed to assign to the plaintiff companies the bankrupt defendant's right to indemnity under the policy subject to the consent of the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The insurer denied liability to indemnify the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The plaintiffs sought leave to join the insurer as an additional defendant seeking a declaration that the insurer was obliged to indemnify the directors in respect of any judgment in favour of the plaintiff companies arising out of any wrongful act within the terms of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">On appeal the Full Court ordered the joinder of the insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Special leave to appeal against the decision was refused by the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">38 Before referring to the judgment it should be noted that s 117 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) had some relevance to it.</sentence>

 (b) a liability against which he is or was so insured has been incurred (whether before or after he became a bankrupt),

39 King CJ who wrote the principal judgment with which Prior and Perry JJ agreed, said of s 117 (at 437):
 
 By virtue of that section, if the trustee in bankruptcy were to obtain payment of moneys from the insurer in consequence of a judgment against the defendant directors, those moneys would not be divisible among the creditors but would be payable to the plaintiffs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In order to obtain satisfaction in that way, it might be necessary for the plaintiffs to make the non-bankrupt directors bankrupt and, having provided a proper indemnity for costs to the trustee in bankruptcy, to institute and prosecute in the trustee's name an action against the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">

40 King CJ referred in his judgment to s 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1935 , which is similar in form and the same in substance as s 21 of the Federal Court Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He enunciated the following propositions about the grant of declaratory relief: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">That the jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief is very wide and judicial pronouncements appearing to restrict the circumstances in which such relief will be granted relate to the sound exercise of discretion rather than to jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It is not necessary that the plaintiff have a cause of action against the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">There is no jurisdictional limit against the grant of declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The Court's power to grant such relief "is only limited by its own discretion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">There may be circumstances which so contraindicate the exercise of the discretion in favour of the grant of declaratory relief that they would lead almost inevitably to the exercise of the discretion against the making of a declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">A declaration will not be made except in matters "which have a real legal context, and to the determination of which the Court's procedure is apt", citing Johnco Nominees Pty Ltd v Albury-Wodonga (NSW) Corporation [1977] 1 NSWLR 43 at 61 (Hutley JA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">There must be some person who has a true interest in opposing the declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The question must not be purely theoretical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">If the determination of the question could not affect the plaintiff's legal rights or commercial or personal interests now or in the future the declaration would almost certainly be refused: citing Gardner v Dairy Industry Authority (1977) 52 ALJR 180 at 188 (Mason J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The principles so enunciated are, with respect, not contentious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">

41 King CJ accepted that the plaintiffs would have to surmount certain obstacles before they could gain recourse to the proceeds of the indemnity but the first and most important of those obstacles was the determination of whether the insurer was liable to indemnify the directors under the policy in respect of any judgment the plaintiffs might recover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He said (at 438): 
 
 If that question is determined against the insurer concurrently with the determination of the defendant directors' liability to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs will avoid the costs of a further trial of that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Moreover, armed with a declaration of the insurer's liability to indemnify the directors, the plaintiffs will be far better placed to secure the consent of the trustee in bankruptcy, or alternatively authority to sue in the trustee's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It is true that the issue of the insurer's liability will cease to be a live issue if the plaintiffs fail in their action against the defendants, but, to my mind, their interest in obtaining a declaration of the insurer's liability concurrently with that of the liability of the defendants, is undeniable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">

Having accepted that the claim to declaratory relief was within jurisdiction the joinder followed as of course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">42 Referring to discretionary considerations, King CJ noted that the trial of the action against the directors seemed likely to be very lengthy, very complex and very costly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The joinder of the insurer would make it a co-defendant with the defendant directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The question which he then posed was whether res judicata would operate as between the co-defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">He concluded that an actual lis in the sense of proceedings between the defendants concerned was not a requisite of res judicata and cited the judgment of Jacobs J in Re Multi-tech Services Pty Ltd (In liq); Heard v Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australasia (1982) 30 SASR 218.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He said (at 441): 
 
 In my opinion, the insurer, if joined as a defendant, would be bound, in subsequent proceedings by the defendant directors or their trustee in bankruptcy, by a declaration of liability and also by any findings of fact made in the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">

King CJ accepted that joinder would involve "embroiling the insurer in these proceedings although, if it is not joined, the occasion for proceedings against it may never arise" (at 441).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">He recognised that that was an important factor in the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">However, it could not prevail against other compelling considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">If the insurer were to plead defences based on want of notification of claims or avoidance of the policy under s 237 of the Companies (South Australia) Code by reason of payment of the premiums by the plaintiffs or a related corporation, such defences could be determined, if appropriate, as preliminary issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">If determined in favour of the insurer, the insurer's involvement in a long and expensive trial would be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">43 His Honour said that, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court must be guided by the overriding principle that a multiplicity of proceedings was to be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">He referred in that respect to s 27 of the Supreme Court Act which is in substance reflected in s 22 of the Federal Court Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">He was particularly concerned about the need to avoid the prospect of a second long and complex trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
44 JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 was distinguished by the Court of Appeal in Victoria in CE Heath Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v Pyramid Building Society (In Liquidation) (1997) 2 VR 256.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">In that case a building society in liquidation sued its former auditors for breaches of retainer and duty of care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The insurers were conducting the defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">However upon inquiry from the plaintiff, they neither admitted nor denied liability to indemnify the auditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">They declined to commit themselves about the interpretation of the policies so far as they provided for maximum amounts of cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The plaintiff sought leave to join them as defendants and to seek declarations against them as to the application of their policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against an order at first instance granting leave to join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The Court held there was no basis for the joinder under the Supreme Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The issues raised against the insurers were additional to those between the building society and the auditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They depended upon discrete facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The Court also rejected the proposed joinder on discretionary considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">45 Ormiston JA, with whom Tadgell JA agreed, identified as a discretionary consideration the fact that joint representation could not be expected to continue for the insured and the insurers who would have conflicting interests at least with respect to the resolution of the claims for declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">That would give rise to great inconvenience and would cause the defendants considerable added expense in circumstances where the plaintiff building society was in liquidation and unable to bear the costs of two sets of representation throughout what was undoubtedly going to be a long and complex trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">It would also have the effect of denying the insurers their rights under the policies to take over and defend the claim in circumstances where control of the defence of the claim might be of the greatest practical importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">46 Phillips JA identified as a discretionary consideration the fact that the insurance questions were hypothetical until the liability of the insured was determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The insurers had not plainly denied liability and might never do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">He also regarded as very important the consideration that the plaintiff was not a party to the insurance contracts and in seeking to have determined the extent of the liability of the insurers to the auditors was seeking to initiate the determination of questions in which it had no direct legal interest although it might have some present commercial concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Any right under s 117 of the Bankruptcy Act was doubly contingent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In those circumstances the Court had to be particularly careful to see that the joinder of the insurers was appropriate before permitting it and thereby embroiling them against their wishes and at the instance of a stranger to the policies in expensive litigation over those policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">47 His Honour said that there was an absence of any current and identifiable dispute between insurer and insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">That stemmed not only from the absence of any plain denial of liability but also from the absence of any clearly articulated claim by the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">He said (at 292): 
 
 Be that as it may, there is obvious uncertainty about just what insurance questions will be material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">That makes it all the harder to conclude that the questions underlying the declarations now sought by the plaintiff do warrant determination, and that it is either just or convenient that those questions be determined in this proceeding between Pyramid and the auditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 

48 These discretionary considerations distinguished the case that faced the Victorian Court of Appeal from the case before the South Australian Full Court and the case before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">As to the decision in JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432, Ormiston J observed (at 270):
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">I should state that I do not think that the mere fact that the disputant is the liquidator of a possible creditor of the insured can prevent that liquidator from raising the issue and seeking declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">I say that largely because that question has been raised and resolved in the JN Taylor case, from which leave to appeal to the High Court was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">If the matter were not free from authority I confess I would have had the gravest doubt whether it was ordinarily appropriate to permit an outsider to seek from the court declaratory relief as to the meaning and effect of a contract between two parties who had not themselves raised any issue as to its meaning and effect and at least one of whom objected to the court's interfering in its private affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 

49 Phillips JA did not suggest that JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 was wrongly decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">He referred to the rejection by King CJ of the view expressed at first instance that the plaintiffs did not have an interest sufficient to maintain the action for declaratory relief unless and until they succeeded in the action against the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">King CJ had characterised that as too narrow a view of the interest of the plaintiffs required to render the issue real rather than theoretical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Phillips JA said: 
 
 That seems to me apt here, if I may say so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">What is wanted in the plaintiff is a sufficient interest to render its claim to declaratory relief "real rather than theoretical" and if that be the test I think that it is probably satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">

50 The decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in CE Health [1997] 2 VR 256 was followed by the Full Court in South Australia in Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd v Price Waterhouse (1996) 68 SASR 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The critical point there was not only that indemnity had not been declined but there had been an acceptance of liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In that case a firm of chartered accountants, formerly auditors to the State Bank of South Australia, were sued by a number of parties including a subsidiary of the Bank for $1 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The claims were based on breaches of duty on the part of the auditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The trial of the action was estimated to last in excess of a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Estimated costs of proceeding to trial, $13 million, would exceed the known assets of the auditors' partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The plaintiffs had obtained orders from the trial judge requiring the auditors' insurer to discover and produce all applicable policies of professional indemnity insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The auditors were also ordered to discover and produce confidential correspondence between them and their insurer relating to notification of the claim and indemnification generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The insurer appealed the production orders to the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">They contended that they were dealing with the claim as if it attracted indemnity in a relevant policy year and had not declined the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">51 In allowing the appeal the Full Court held that the action did not bring into issue any question concerning the insurance arrangements as the insurers had not declined indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">There was no arguable case for joinder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Accordingly, documents evidencing the insurance arrangements were unrelated to any matter in question on the pleadings and were not a proper subject for discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 decision was distinguished on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Cox J, who dissented in the result, agreed with Perry J that no arguable case for joining the defendant's insurer had been advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">He said (at 22): 
 
 The orders made in JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (In liq) v Bond (1993) 59 SASR 432 were exceptional, for the reasons that are explained in the judgment, and the case is clearly distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">

52 Perry J described JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 as unusual "in that there were overlapping questions of fact".</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">He referred to the insurer's denial of liability on the basis that the conduct of the defendant directors was such as to disentitle them to indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The same conduct would need to be scrutinised to determine whether the plaintiffs' claim against the directors should succeed (at 37).</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">He said (at 37): 
 
 The decision in JN Taylor Holdings must be confined to its special facts, and in particular the fact that not only was there in that case a denial of liability on the part of the insurer, but the facts and circumstances relevant to the grounds upon which liability were denied were more or less co-extensive with the factual inquiry which would be necessary in order to dispose of the issues raided [sic] as between the parties in that case other than the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">That will not often be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">More commonly, I would have thought any denial of liability on the part of the insurer will not involve the need to address questions of fact which are common to the questions arising in the context of the resolution of the claim against the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">
 

He observed that the question whether there were any common questions of fact would depend upon what stand was ultimately taken by the insurer and the ground upon which at some stage it might be prompted to deny liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">53 The Queensland Court of Appeal in Interchase Corporation Ltd (in liq) v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd [1998] 2 Qd R 301 by majority, declined to follow JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">In that case Interchase Corporation commenced proceedings against valuers in connection with the development of a retail and commercial complex in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">It claimed to have lost about $60 million through a negligent valuation of the complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">FAI was the professional indemnity insurer of the valuers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">FAI conducted the defence of the litigation for some time then declined indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The valuers did not object to that decision and did not foreshadow any possibility of contesting it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Interchase then sought to join FAI as an additional defendant to obtain a declaration that it was liable to indemnify the valuers in respect of their liability to Interchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">A judge acceded to that application and an appeal from that decision was allowed by majority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The majority held in substance that convenience alone could not justify joinder of an additional defendant under the Rules of the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">There was no controversy between the valuers and the insurer and therefore their rights inter se would not be determined in the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The joinder would serve no useful purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">54 Byrne J referred to the judgment of King CJ in JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432 and particularly his finding that the insurer if joined as a defendant would be bound in subsequent proceedings by the defendant directors or their trustee in bankruptcy by a declaration of liability and findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">King CJ, as noted earlier, relied upon the decision of Jacobs J in Re Multi-Tech Services 30 SASR 218.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">However, according to Byrne J, Jacobs J, in the earlier case had assumed rather than decided that the additional party would be bound and did not consider whether the determination of an existing controversy between co-defendants was essential to a binding adjudication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">55 McPherson JA, who agreed with Byrne J, suggested that the more expansive Rules of Court relating to joinder of parties in South Australia might explain the decision in JN Taylor Holdings 59 SASR 432.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">He said (at 315): 
 
 Plainly, a rule enabling a court to determine a question because it is "related to or connected with" any relief claimed in the existing cause or matter may be capable of justifying a joinder like that sought in this instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It is, however, difficult to see how it would effectively solve the problem discussed by Byrne J in his reasons on this appeal of the binding effect (or lack of it) of the declaration which the plaintiff now wishes to claim against FAI, which is a question that was not explored in JN Taylor Holdings v Bond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">
 

56 In dissent, Davies JA said (at 309): 
 
 I accept that there would be no point in making the order for joinder if the declaration did not, in practice, effectively determine the issue of FAI's liability to the valuers as between those parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">But I do not think it is sufficient, for the joinder to lack utility, that it is not binding between those parties at law if, in its practical effect, it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">
 

He agreed with Byrne J that Interchase and the valuers were not privies for the purposes of res judicata and issue estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">He also agreed that neither doctrine would operate to bind FAI and the valuers inter se in respect of that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">His Honour went on however to refer to the wider concept of estoppel enunciated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589, a case in which admittedly there was mutuality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">He said (at 310): 
 
 
 There was mutuality in Anshun and their Honours in the joint judgment to which I have referred did not find the abuse of process test, as elucidated in some of the English cases, of great utility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">However, abuse of process is a similar mechanism designed "to protect against 'the scandal of conflicting decisions'," which can achieve that protection where mutuality is absent as it is here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">

FAI and the valuers would have the full opportunity of contesting the question in respect of which the declaration was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Davies JA thought it would therefore be an abuse of process to permit either to litigate that question in subsequent proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It followed that the declarations sought would effectively determine the question of FAI's liability to the valuers as between those parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">57 His Honour rejected the contention that the question was hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Despite the contingencies that Interchase might not succeed against the valuers or that the valuers and FAI might resolve their differences or that the valuers might never go bankrupt or into liquidation and that if they did their trustee or liquidator might not proceed against FAI, it was unnecessary to consider the likelihood of those contingencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">His Honour said (at 311): 
 
 There can be no doubt that, notwithstanding contingencies of a similar kind, the valuers could obtain a declaration as to FAI's liability to them before they are held liable to Interchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">

He then said (at 311): 
 
 Moreover, the factors I have mentioned - the insolvency of the valuers, their failure to seek an indemnity from FAI and the ineffectuality of any judgment by Interchase against the valuers unless FAI is liable to indemnify them --- together combine, in my view, to give Interchase a real interest in the relief which it seeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">

58 I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Byrne J that the decision of Jacobs J in Multi-tech Services 30 SASR 218 does not seem to be authority for the proposition that an insurer joined as a co-defendant at the suit of a claimant against the insured, would be bound as between itself and the insured, by a declaration that it was liable to provide indemnity to the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">There was no exposition by Jacobs J of any principle that would support that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">It is not necessary for me to decide the general question here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">In my opinion the approach taken in JN Taylor 59 SASR 432 is supportable on a wider basis without reliance on a res judicata or issue estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">That wider basis was enunciated by Davies JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In this respect I refer also to my review of the authorities relating to the general concept of abuse of process by relitigation in Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [59] --- [69].</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I consider, as did Davies JA, that there is utility in a declaration against an insurer in circumstances such as the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">That factor however, while important, does not exhaust the discretionary considerations, particular to this case, to which I should have regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">59 There is a dispute between KMF and its insurers in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">KMF notified a claim and the Insurers denied liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">They had not offered to conduct any defence on behalf of KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The liquidator of KMF is unwilling to proceed against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Although s 562 confers no legal right on the applicants as against the Insurers, it creates a priority right in the proceeds of any successful claim against the Insurers which gives them a very real interest in having the Insurers' obligations to KMF determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The basis upon which the Insurers have denied liability raises a discrete issue about the application of an exclusion clause in the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">On the face of it that question may be susceptible of resolution within a short compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">The question is whether the nature of the claim which the applicants seek to bring against KMF brings the liability which they would assert within the scope of the exclusion clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">That is a matter which should be capable of determination largely upon the pleadings, agreed facts and documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">60 The Insurers reserve as a fallback position the possibility that they may rely upon an exclusion clause relating to reckless conduct on the part of the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">In that event it is likely that the factual issues they raise will overlap with some of the issues raised in the pleading against the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Presumably the Insurers, if they wish to raise that exclusion, would plead it by way of defence to the declaratory relief that is sought against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The overlap of factual issues in that event would militate in favour of, rather than against, joinder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">At the moment, however, that is hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The Court is left with an issue raised by the Insurers which, on the face of it, seems capable of relatively expeditious determination without involving the Insurers in all issues at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">61 The joinder of the Insurers is sought primarily under O 6 r 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Their refusal of indemnity is presently based upon the nature of the claim brought against KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">They contend that a relevant exclusion clause applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The correctness of that position necessarily involves a question common with that arising in the substantive proceedings and that question is the nature of the case made against KMF.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">In the event that the Insurers invoke the exclusion clause based upon reckless conduct on the part of KMF's directors, then there are likely to be overlapping questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Joinder is within the power of the Court under O 6 r 2(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">62 For the reasons which I have already given, this is a case in which, in my opinion, it is convenient and useful to direct the joinder of the Insurers as respondents and I will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Depending on the pleadings which are filed, it may be convenient to make further directions for determination of a preliminary issue in relation to the Insurers' refusal of indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">I certify that the preceding sixty-two (62) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
