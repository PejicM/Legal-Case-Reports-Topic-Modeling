<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The principal object of Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is to provide a mechanism that will save an ailing company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">One method of achieving this object is through a deed of company arrangement that provides for the partial payment of debts due to creditors in full settlement of their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For the most part, the legislation does not require creditors to be treated equally or that they be given the same priority as in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">There is one exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By s 444DA a deed of company arrangement must contain a provision that employee creditors be given at least the same priority as in a winding up unless a majority otherwise agree, or the court permits, a departure from that rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The court's power to approve a deed is limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It can only make an order if it "is satisfied that the non-inclusion of the provision would be likely to result in the same or a better outcome for eligible employee creditors as a whole than would result from an immediate winding up of the company": s 444DA(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Such an order was made in relation to a deed proposed for Advance Healthcare Group Ltd (AHG).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It remains to explain why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 AHG operates in the pharmaceutical industry through its trading subsidiary, Pharmeasy Pty Ltd. Shares in AHG are quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), although trading in those shares has been suspended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 28 April 2008, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Dixon of BDO Kendalls, were appointed joint administrators of AHG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Hancock, also of BDO Kendalls, were appointed joint administrators of Pharmeasy on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appointor was Fulcrum Equity Limited, a major shareholder and the only secured creditor of AHG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 The administrators conducted an investigation into the affairs of AHG and Pharmeasy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They reached the conclusion that both were insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In particular, AHG had a shortfall of assets over liabilities that exceeded $8 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Its creditors were Fulcrum Equity, which was owed $3.4 million, priority creditors (employees) who were owed approximately $377,740 and unsecured creditors whose claims totalled $7,430,687.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The administrators were of the view that if AHG were wound up both employee and unsecured creditors would receive nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In part this was because, in their view, a liquidator would have no claims against the directors for insolvent trading or breach of duty and neither AHG nor Pharmeasy had entered into any transaction that could be set aside as an unfair preference, unfair commercial transaction or unfair loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">4 The administrators received from Romfal Corporate Pty Ltd, acting on behalf of a syndicate of investors, a proposal that, if implemented, would have both AHG and Pharmeasy execute a deed of company arrangement that would see creditors' claims compromised and AHG relisted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Romfal has been involved in several reorganisations of public companies and their re-quotation on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The administrators put the proposal to the second meeting of creditors of each company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">A report in relation to each company was produced and provided to the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The key features of each report were in similar terms as follows: 
 
&#8226; The syndicate (or its nominees) will advance the sum of $1,275,000 in order to create a pool of funds for distribution to creditors; 
 
&#8226; AHG will retain its existing assets and subsidiaries to enable it to requote on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Pharmeasy will retain its assets;
 
&#8226; The distribution to creditors will be in full and final satisfaction of all creditors' claims;
 
&#8226; Should Pharmeasy be required to trade prior to the formal handover to the syndicate, it is proposed that trading losses incurred between 28 April 2008 and the handover to the syndicate, be funded from the priority distribution of AHG to its secured creditor, Fulcrum Equity; 
 
&#8226; The pool of funds will be raised through capital raisings by AHG, which will be subject to the receipt of shareholder approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The syndicate has informed the administrator that it has secured an underwriter;
 
&#8226; Existing shares in AHG will be consolidated on a one for 40 basis;
 
&#8226; The syndicate will bear the risk on the capital raisings;
 
&#8226; The administrator has received a $100,000 deposit which is refundable in the event that the conditions of the proposal are not satisfied;
 
&#8226; The directors of both AHG and Pharmeasy will be removed and replaced by nominees of the syndicate;
 
&#8226; Following shareholder approval, the deed of company arrangement will terminate and a trust fund established to hold the pool of funds for creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">AHG will advance the pool of funds to the Trustees of the Trust in full and final satisfaction of the syndicate's offer in relation to the recapitalisation proposal;
 
&#8226; Fulcrum Equity will limit its entitlement to security pursuant to its charge over the assets of AHG to $600,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The administrator's preliminary conclusion is that Fulcrum's security is valid at least to the extent of fresh advances made in and around February/March 2008;
 
&#8226; Employee creditors retain their entitlement to priority for the amount they would receive under GEERS plus an additional 10%;
 
&#8226; Creditors of both AHG and Pharmeasy will be required to prove their debts to the Trustees of the Trust Fund;
 
&#8226; Creditors will become beneficiaries of the Trust Fund in those amounts;
 
&#8226; The Trustees of the Trust Fund will be Stephen Robert Dixon and Laurence Andrew Fitzgerald in the case of AHG and Geoffrey Trent Hancock and Laurence Andrew Fitzgerald in the case of Pharmeasy;
 
&#8226; The proposal is conditional on the ASX providing written confirmation to AHG that it will lift the suspension on the trading of AHG's securities on completion of the capital raisings without the need to re-comply with chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules on finalising the deed of company arrangement; and
 
&#8226; The proposal is conditional upon the approval of AHG's shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">5 The aspect of the proposal that is important for present purposes is that under the deed the priority given to employee creditors would be limited to an amount equal to what "they would receive under GEERS plus an additional 10%".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">GEERS is the acronym for the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme a non-statutory scheme established by the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The scheme is administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Under the scheme money granted by Parliament is distributed to employees whose employment has been terminated because their employer is insolvent, the employer has insufficient assets to pay their entitlements and there is no other source of funds available to pay those entitlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The entitlements covered by the scheme are unpaid wages, unpaid annual leave, unpaid long service leave, unpaid payment of notice and up to 16 weeks redundancy pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The scheme is discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Department decides which employees are to benefit and in what amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">6 AHG had three employee creditors, Mr Atkinson, Mr Law and Ms McGinn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The amounts they were owed were, respectively, $288,676, $55,856 and $33,140.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The fund to be put up by the investors was sufficient for these debts to be paid in full, however under the proposed deed the amounts they would receive would be less than the full amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">According to the calculations made by the administrators, Mr Atkinson would receive between $85,796 and $11,166, Mr Law between $24,799 and $12,059 and Ms McGinn between $23,267 and $9,411.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">7 The proposal could not go ahead without the employee creditors approval or court order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In the first instance the administrators sought the approval of the employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">They convened a telephone meeting of the employee creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Atkinson and Mr Law attended the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Ms McGinn appeared by her proxy, Mr Harrison, a solicitor who acts for all three employee creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The meeting was held prior to the finalisation of the proposed deed and was intended by the administrators as an opportunity to determine whether the employee creditors would be minded to approve a deed of company arrangement that did not contain a provision that gave them the same priority they would receive in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The three employees attended the meeting as did their solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The solicitor advised the meeting that his clients were against the proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He said Fulcrum Equity was responsible for the insolvency of AHG and that there were causes of action against the company which a liquidator could pursue, albeit his clients did not wish to become involved in such litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">He did not say what the actions were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He did, however, say that his clients required Fulcrum Equity to contribute more to the proposed fund and that its level of participation in the distribution of the fund should be reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Each employee also spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Mr Law said the deed was unacceptable and that AHG should be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Atkinson agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Ms McGinn said she was prepared to write off all her entitlements in order that Mr Boyd, a director of Fulcrum Equity, receive nothing in the liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The minutes of the meeting record that the employee creditors did not agree to the non-inclusion of a provision in the proposed deed giving them the same priority as they would obtain in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">At a later meeting the employees voted down the proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">8 While the employees of AHG would not support the proposed deed, it was approved by the general body of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">So also was the deed proposed for Pharmeasy which was interdependent on the AHG proposal being implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Incidentally, the deed proposed for that company contained a similar provision relating to the employees of Pharmeasy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Those employees agreed unanimously to the non-inclusion of a provision giving them the same priority as in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">However, because the employee creditors of AHG voted down the proposal the whole arrangement could not go ahead without an order of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">9 Prior to 2007 there was a view that the distribution of the assets of an insolvent company under a deed of company arrangement otherwise than in accordance with the rules that apply in a winding up was contrary to the policy established by the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">See for example, Re Ansett Australia Ltd (No 1) [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2002) 115 FCR 376 ; Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2004) 22 ACLC 667 and Lam Soon Australia Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) v Molit (No 55) Pty Ltd (1996) 70 FCR 34 , among other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The view was that if a deed did not adopt the pari passu rule in s 555 , or the priorities established by s 556 , the deed was liable to be set aside under s 445D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">According to that section, a deed may be terminated for a variety of reasons including that it is unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a creditor, or that it should be terminated for some other reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">10 My own view was that Part 5.3A did not require creditors to be treated equally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Nor did it require adoption of the priorities that applied in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I explained why in Commonwealth of Australia v Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) [2005] FCA 902 ; (2005) 145 FCR 220.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I provided examples of circumstances in which ordinary commercial commonsense dictated that the priority given to employees in a winding up should be altered and that unsecured creditors should not be treated equally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">One example was that of a company trading from leased premises that were purpose built and in an ideal location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The interests of all creditors would be best served if the arrears of rent were paid to prevent a forfeiture of the lease notwithstanding that other creditors only received a portion of their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Another example was of a business that employs both skilled and unskilled workers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The skilled workers may be difficult to replace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">To ensure that the business survived it may be necessary to pay the skilled workers in full and let the others go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Put rather more directly, there will be cases where the equal treatment of creditors and the maintenance of priorities will thwart an attempt to revive an ailing company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">11 My view has not survived, at least so far as priority claims are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In 2004 the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services published its review of corporate insolvency laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The Joint Committee found that in some circumstances it may be appropriate that a deed provide for the different treatment of creditors: Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, Corporate Insolvency Laws: A Stocktake (Canberra, 2004) at para 11.16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">However, as regards employees, the Joint Committee recommended that the Corporations Act be amended to make it mandatory for a deed of company arrangement to reserve the priority available to creditors in a winding up unless affected creditors agreed to waive their priority: para 11.20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Joint Committee added that the amendment should allow creditors or the administrator the right to initiate court proceedings to have the deed upheld if in the court's view the deed offered the dissenting creditors a better return than they would obtain in a liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">12 This aspect of the Joint Committee's report was implemented in substance by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">That statute introduced a range of measures to modernise the insolvency provisions in the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">One was the introduction of s 444DA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007 (Cth) said (perhaps by way of overstatement) that it was implicit in the then current law that the priorities provided for in a liquidation would generally be observed in the deed of company arrangement: para 4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This was for the reason that the model deed in Sch 8A of the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) preserves to creditors the priorities applicable in a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Yet there was no obligation to adopt the model deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">If it was not adopted the only remedy to affected creditors was to apply to have the deed set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That would be difficult for employee creditors having regard to the cost of court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Thus "To enhance the standing of employee creditors in voluntary administrations, the Bill will amend the law to make it mandatory for a [deed] to preserve the priority available to employee creditors in a winding up unless employees agree to waive their priority": Explanatory Memorandum at para 4.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The provision in the Bill (Sch 1, item 1) recognised that the priority of employee entitlements should be safeguarded in deeds but not in the precise terms proposed by the Joint Committee: Explanatory Memorandum at para 3.42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">13 It has long been a public policy objective to protect employee entitlements in the insolvency of the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Employees have been accorded a measure of priority in both private bankruptcies and company liquidations for many years, not only in Australia but in many other jurisdictions as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Part 5.3A does not apply to companies that are being wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Its main object is to keep corporations alive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It is possible that object will be compromised by the new s 444DA if a company in difficult financial circumstances cannot be saved because priority must be given to its employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">This will be to the disadvantage not only of the employee creditors but also to the creditors as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">14 Fortunately that will not happen in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">First of all, as the administrators explained, having regard to the financial position of AHG in a winding up the employees could not do better than what they might obtain under GEERS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Accordingly, the condition to the operation of s 444DA(5) was satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It is difficult to understand why the employees were prepared to forego the possibility of obtaining a significant sum for no apparent gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Most likely their objective was to achieve a better offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In other words, they were engaging in commercial blackmail of sorts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">History shows they were not successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The other possibility is they were motivated by spite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">If that is the case they deserve little sympathy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Whatever the employees' motives it was clearly in the interests of the general body of unsecured creditors for the proposal to go ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In a winding up they stood to get nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Under the proposal they were to receive a significant distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The only thing that stood in their way was the intransigence of the employee creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Their reasons (whatever they may be) for not wanting the proposal to go ahead could not be allowed to stop an otherwise beneficial outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Associate:
