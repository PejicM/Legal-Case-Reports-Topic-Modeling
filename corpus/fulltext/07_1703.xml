<sentence id="s0">
 This is an application for a consent determination of native title rights and interests held by the Ngurrara people in respect of land and waters within the Kimberley region of Western Australia that has been designated "Determination Area A".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The parties have agreed to deal with areas of exclusive possession in Determination Area A separately from reserve, and former reserve, areas which will be dealt with in Determination Area B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They agree that mediation should continue in relation to Determination Area B and that no determination of native title should presently be made in respect of that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The area for which the determination is sought covers some 77,810 square kilometres and is located in the vicinity of the Great Sandy Desert, between the Southern extent of the Kimberley pastoral leases and the Percival Lakes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The area is comprised largely of unallocated crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Ngurrara application was first lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal on 22 March 1996 pursuant to section 61 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) as it stood prior to the commencement of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) ("the old Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In accordance with the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act"), the application was deemed to be filed in the Federal Court of Australia in Perth on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Through mediation in the National Native Title Tribunal ("NNTT") the parties to the application have recently reached an agreement which, amongst other things, recognises the pre-existing native title rights and interests of the claimants and contemplates that this Court will make a determination of native title by consent and without the need for a hearing, pursuant to s 87A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Section 87A of the Act sets out several pre-conditions that must be met in order for the court to make the orders sought, by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">These conditions are: The first three pre-conditions have been met in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The period of notification referred to in s 66 of the Act expired on 11 November 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The agreement between the Ngurrara applicants and the three other respondents is in writing and has been signed on behalf of the parties by their legal representatives of by the parties themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It was filed with the Court on 26 October 2007 in the form of a Minute of Proposed Consent Determination of Native Title Area "A" ("the Minute") annexed to a signed Minute of Consent Orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">All parties to the proceeding are parties to the agreement the subject of the Minute and the Minute of Consent Orders and therefore the Registrar need not give notice to any party under s 87A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It follows that there are no objections for the Court to take into account under s 87A(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine native title applications is specifically provided for by the Act in s 81.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This jurisdiction expressly includes the power to make orders by consent pursuant to s 87A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">These statutory provisions make it clear that the Court's jurisdiction is enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It should, however, be noted that the agreement in this case relates to part of the land and waters the subject of the Ngurrara application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The making of a determination of native title in respect of part of an application is a matter that falls within both s 87(3) and s 87A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It follows that the Court may make orders determining that native title exists in relation to Determination Area A while leaving the issues outstanding in relation to Determination Area B for resolution at a later date (Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v State of Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 at [6] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This approach has been taken in a number of cases in Western Australia under s 87 (Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 ; James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 365) and under alternatively s 87 and s 87A ( Brown (on behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In Brown's case at [15], Bennett J noted that s 87(1)(d) had not been repealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That subsection provided in effect that an order could not be made under s 87 unless the Court was satisfied that an order in, or consistent with, the terms of the agreement reached between the parties could not be made under s 87A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Section 87(1)(d) has now been repealed and accordingly has no application to this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In my opinion, the relevant order in this matter may be made under either s 87(1)(a)(ii) and (3) or s 87A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I accept the joint submissions of all the parties that it is preferable to proceed under s 87A because the balance of the application which concerns Determination Area B will then be deemed to be amended to remove the area covered by the proposed determination: s 64(1B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The application will remain registered following the amendment and the Registrar will be obliged to amend the Register of Native Title Claims even though the registration test has not been re-applied: s 190(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Section 94A of the Act provides that an order made by the Court for a determination of native title "must set out details of the matters mentioned in section 225".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Section 225 specifies the matters which must be addressed in a determination of native title and provides: 
 
 'A determination of native title is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area ) of land or waters and, if it does exist, a determination of: 
 

 
 
 (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and
 (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and
 (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and
 (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this Act); and
 (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease---whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">' 
 

 The proposed determination submitted by the parties deals with each of the specified matters, and therefore meets the requirements of s 94A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In conclusion, the Court has jurisdiction to make the orders sought and there is nothing in the agreed terms that would suggest that the power of the Court would be exceeded by making those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It therefore remains only to consider whether it would be "appropriate" to make the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The discretion conferred by s 87A is in substance the same as that which applies in the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 87 and must, of course, be exercised judicially and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act (see Brown at [22]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion, and the weight to be given to those matters, may vary according to the particular circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Justice North observed in Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [6] ---[9] that the Act is designed to encourage parties to take responsibility for the resolution of native title proceedings, without the need for litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Court's power must be exercised flexibly and with this purpose in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Orders may be made where the Court is not provided with all of the evidence or the primary facts substantiating native title where the Court is satisfied that the parties have freely and on an informed basis come to an agreement ( Brown at [23] in respect of s 87A and Hughes at [9] in respect of s 87).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">If, of course, an agreement were reached where there was nothing to support the claimed connection of the applicants to their country, or the determination appeared to be unfair or unjust, the Court might conclude that a determination would be inappropriate and decline to make the orders sought ( James at [4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">That is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In the present case, the applicants, the State and the Martu People have had independent legal advice and although the Shire of Derby/West Kimberley has not been legally represented, the Shire Planner has requested that access rights for the Shire's employees and agents to the Determination Area be recognised, particularly as regards access to upgrade the roads and infrastructure of the Kurlku and Purlawarla communities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">These rights have been specifically recognised as "other interests" in Schedule 4 to the Minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The State has taken an active and significant part in the negotiation of the consent determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">This was said by Emmett J to be an important factor: Munn at [29].</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The State has had regard to the requirements of the Act and applied a rigorous and detailed assessment process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It has satisfied itself that the consent determination is justified in all the circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There is no suggestion that the agreement was not freely made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The agreed terms of the proposed orders are unambiguous and are appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The continuous connection of the Ngurrara people with Determination Area A is acknowledged by all parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There is also evidence to support that connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Ngurrara Native Title Claim WC96/32 Supplementary Consent Determination Report dated January 2006 by Daniel Aime Vachon (amended in October 2007) ("the Report") describes the enduring connection of the native title claimant group to their country within the claim area and, on the basis of the material contained in the Report, supports their claim to a native title right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of Determination Area A to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The members of the Ngurrara claim group are the persons who have native title rights and interests in the Ngurrara application area under traditional law and custom, and are descended from the inhabitants of the claim area at the time of settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Ngurrara native title claim group is comprised of those persons, identified by reference to descent and other culturally-relevant heads of connection to country, who are, in accordance with the normative system of traditional law and custom, responsible for the care and maintenance of country within the claim area and for the transmission of that responsibility to successive generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The overarching system of jila law shared by all members of the Ngurrara claim group is a system unique to the application area, and recognised as such by neighbouring groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Jila law is still recognised and practiced, and by this law the applicants' demonstrate their ongoing connection to the Application area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This ongoing connection is, for example, demonstrated through the maintenance of traditional practices such as painting country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Many of the traditional owners paint the places within their ngurrara where they were born/ found and grew up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The State has had regard to the Report together with additional written and audiovisual material provided by the applicants, as set out in the affidavit of Christy Hawker affirmed on 30 October 2007, in addition to a variety of other records held by State Government departments or in publicly available records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It commissioned an independent anthropologist to review that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Ms Hawker in her affidavit affirms that the State, which represents the community generally, has had regard to the requirements of the Act and is satisfied that the material provided on behalf of the applicant's demonstrates the applicants' traditional connection with the Ngurrara application area and satisfies ss 223 and 225 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The parties are to be congratulated for reaching agreement and I also acknowledge the significant contribution to this result made by the NNTT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The preference of settling matters as opposed to litigating them has been recognised as a desirable public objective by the High Court and this Court on numerous occasions and its is always heartening when native title claims are settled by agreement rather than through litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As the Chief Justice said in Mark Anderson on behalf of the Spinifex People v State of Western Australia [2000] FCA 1717 , at [8]: 'The courts have always encouraged parties to settle their claims amicably'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Agreement is especially desirable in native title cases due to the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Agreement between the parties minimises cost and distress and establishes goodwill between the parties for future dealings: North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland [1996] HCA 2 ; (1996) 185 CLR 595.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In these circumstances I am satisfied that it would be appropriate to make an order in the terms agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
