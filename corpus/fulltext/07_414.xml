<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The following are my reasons for an order that I made in each of these two proceedings on 12 March 2007, dismissing the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 In order to understand the genesis of these proceedings, it is necessary that I set out some background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 On 5 February 2007, there were eight Native Title claimant applications before the Court for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Those of present relevance are:
 
 (a) The Wongatha Claim (WAD 6005/1998);
 (b) The Cosmo Newberry Claim (WAD 144/1998); and
 (c) The Wutha Claim (WAD 6064/1998).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">

4 I dismissed the Wongatha Claim and the Cosmo Newberry Claim, and I dismissed the Wutha Claim in so far as it related to land and waters the subject of the Wongatha Claim: see Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">As in those Reasons for Judgment, I will use the abbreviation "Cosmo" for "Cosmo Newberry".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 The Reasons for Judgment were lengthy, and pursuant to an application made by the Wongatha applicants immediately following my making of the orders of dismissal and publication of my reasons, I ordered that the Registrar of this Court not notify the Native Title Registrar of the decisions for a period of 14 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Section 189A of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act ") provides that the Registrar of this Court must, "as soon as practicable", notify the Native Title Registrar of the details of any decision of this Court that covers a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">At the time of the delivery of judgment on 5 February 2007, there was no opportunity for the parties to read the Reasons for Judgment or to make submissions as to the significance of the expression "as soon as practicable" in the circumstances, and I thought it arguable that in those circumstances the expression "as soon as practicable" may permit the fortnight's delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">No party opposed the making of the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 Subsequently, the Wongatha applicants asked that I extend the period but I declined to do so on the basis that whatever the position may have been immediately upon delivery of judgment on 5 February 2007, by 19 February 2007 it could no longer be said that it was not practicable for the Registrar of this Court to notify the Native Title Registrar of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Accordingly, on 20 February 2007 he notified the Native Title Registrar of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">7 Subsection 190(4) of the Act provides, so far as relevant, as follows:
 
 "(4) If: 
 
 
 
 (a) the Registrar is notified under section ... 189A of a decision ... covering a claim; ... 
 
 the Registrar must, as soon as practicable: 
 
 (d) if the application in question has been withdrawn, dismissed or otherwise finalised --- remove the entry on the Register that relates to the claim; or 
 (e) in any other case --- amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it only relates to the matters in relation to which the application has not been finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">" 
 
 
 

The reference to the "Register" is a reference to the Register of Native Title Claims that is governed by Part 7 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">8 On 23 February 2007, the Native Title Registrar advised the Wongatha applicants and the Cosmo applicants that in his view s 190(4) required him to remove, or, in the case of the Wutha Claim, to amend, the entries on the Register, on the basis that my orders of 5 February 2007 were dismissals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He indicated that he proposed to do so after 4.00 pm on 28 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">9 The Wongatha and Cosmo proceedings were commenced on 27 February 2007 and 28 February 2007, respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In them, the Wongatha applicants and the Cosmo applicants, respectively, seek an order that the Native Title Registrar be restrained from removing from the Register the entry relating to the Wongatha or Cosmo Claim, as the case may be, or amending the Register relating to any other application in which the Goldfields Land and Sea Council represents the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Wutha Claim is one of these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">10 In substance, the "final" relief claimed in each proceeding is an injunction directed to preserving the status quo until appeals against the orders of 5 February 2007 are heard and determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The order sought in each application has the appearance of interlocutory relief and may be interlocutory relief, even though it is the final relief sought in each of the two proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Separately, however, the applicants in each proceeding have sought what has been designated as "interlocutory relief" until the proceeding can be heard and determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">11 There was argument before me on 28 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Clearly, if the word "dismissed" was satisfied by my orders of 5 February 2007, I would not have power to order the Native Title Registrar to refrain from doing as he was proposing to do, since so to order would be to fly in the face of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">On the other hand, if the Wongatha and Cosmo applicants' argument was correct, the statutory provision would not oblige the Registrar to do as he was proposing to do, and any removal or amendment by him of an entry on the Register would be unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">At the time of the argument on 28 February 2007, not all parties had been served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Since the matter could not then be resolved, I ordered the Registrar not to remove the entries on the Register relating to the Wongatha Claim, the Cosmo Claim (or the Wutha Claim) until Tuesday 13 March 2007 or further order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I also made directions for the filing and service of submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">12 I fixed the interlocutory applications in both proceedings for judgment on Monday 12 March 2007 at 4.15 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On that occasion, I announced my decision that the order directed to the Registrar should not be further extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This would mean that the Registrar must, as soon as practicable (I presume on Tuesday 13 March 2007), act as he had earlier proposed to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 At the time of delivering judgment on Monday 12 March 2007, I inquired of the legal representatives of the applicants in each of the two proceedings, whether, in view of the conclusion that I had reached as to the meaning of "dismissed", there was any reason why the substantive proceeding should not also be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">They indicated that there was none, and accordingly I ordered that each proceeding be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">14 The Wongatha applicants have said, through their counsel, Mr Hooker, all that could reasonably be said in favour of the proposition that it is arguable that the word "dismissed" in s 190(4)(d) does not bear its literal meaning, but I do not agree that this is arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On the contrary, I think it clear beyond reasonable argument that the word "dismissed" is satisfied by a dismissal at first instance following a trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">15 There are three reasons why I think that the word "dismissed" in s 190(4) bears the meaning to which I have referred, and which was satisfied by the orders of dismissal made on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">First, the plain meaning of the word "dismissed" is satisfied by the dismissal of an application following a trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Sections 189A and 190 (4)(d) are concerned with applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Section 61 of the Act provides for the "applications" that may be made under Div 1 of Pt 3 of the Act , one of which is a "native title determination application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Such an application may be either a claimant application or a non-claimant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The applications that were the subject of my orders of 5 February 2007 were claimant applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">An appeal is not, and is not an aspect of, these claimant applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">16 Second, Part 7 of the Act reflects an intention that the Register, being a public register available for inspection (s 187) , be kept up to date, and it would frustrate that intention that a native title claim should remain on the Register after it has been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The legislative intention that the Register should accurately reflect the up to date position regarding claims, is expressed in ss 63 , 64 (3) and (4), 66 , 66A and 66B (3) and (4) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The frequent use of the expression "as soon as practicable" in these provisions emphasises this intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">17 Section 186 sets out the information that the Native Title Registrar is required to include in the Register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There is no mention of, for example, the fact that a registered claim is the subject of an order of dismissal that is the subject of an appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Section 186 contemplates only that pending but not yet resolved claims will be registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">18 One of the pieces of information to be included in the Register is, in substance, a description of the native title rights and interests in the claim that, relevantly, the Native Title Registrar considers "prima facie, could be established" (s 186(1)(g)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It would be incongruous that an entry of such prima facie native title rights and interests should remain on the Register after the Court has heard and dismissed the related application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">19 This last consideration leads naturally to the third reason why I think it clear that the word "dismissed" in s 190(4) is apt to describe the orders I made on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Until a claim has been heard and determined, it is not known whether the claimants do or do not have native title in relation to the area in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Register represents a compromise between conflicting interests pending the hearing and determination of a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">That compromise is that the Native Title Registrar is required to enter particulars of a claim where the he or she is satisfied of certain matters on a prima facie basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Registration gives rise to certain benefits to claimants, such as the so called "right to negotiate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Parliament might, instead, have taken the course of allowing no benefits to claimants until the final hearing and determination of their claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The fact that the compromise accords benefits to claimants on a prima facie basis is no reason why, following a hearing and dismissal of their claim, the prima facie position should not be supplanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Once there has been a dismissal, the reason for the compromise has disappeared, and one would expect the prima facie position to be supplanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 The above reasons are the reasons for the orders of dismissal that I made in these two proceedings on 12 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
