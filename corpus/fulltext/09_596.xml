 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 
 This is an appeal from orders made by Federal Magistrate Raphael on 23 January 2009 dismissing an application for Constitutional writs which would have the effect of quashing a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 10 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant is a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China who claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He claimed to have been a taxi driver in China and that he had become a Christian in 2004 when he was introduced to Christianity through a manager of the taxi company where he worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant claimed that he had used his position as a taxi driver to proselytise customers by handing out Christian publications to persons using his taxi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He claimed to have been detained and ill-treated for these activities and that this led him to leave China for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The appellant arrived in Australia in October 2007 on a tourist visa with about fifteen other people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The tour operator was a company which was referred to as the "ADS" (Approved Destination Status) tour operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It provided a report to the Department ("ADS report") of the "illegal stay" abroad of the appellant and a female passenger, later described as Ms X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The ADS report contained two items of "information" which are said to have given rise to an obligation on the part of the Tribunal to give particulars of the information to the appellant under s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The first item was that the appellant was in a relationship with Ms X, that he wanted to travel abroad with her, that they were "sleeping on the same bed" and that they were planning to get married.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The ADS report stated that the information about the relationship had been provided to the tour operator by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The second item was that the appellant was employed in China as a legal representative of a company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">This was in contrast to the information which the appellant had supplied in support of his protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The information about the appellant's employment as a legal representative in China was also stated in the ADS report to have been supplied by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The delegate was aware of at least some of this information but did not take it into account in his decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">At an oral hearing before the Tribunal on 23 April 2008, the Tribunal raised with the appellant the information about the relationship between himself and Ms X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I will set out more details of the exchange which took place at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It is sufficient to say by way of introduction that the Tribunal did not tell the appellant that the information which it had received came from the ADS report or that the appellant was said to have provided the information to the tour operator himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The question of the appellant's employment was not raised by the Tribunal with the appellant in the course of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The day following the hearing, on 24 April 2008, the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellant pursuant to s 424A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The letter provided particulars of two items of information which it said could be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">One of the items referred to in the letter was a report from a third party (apparently from the tour operator), which noted that the appellant had travelled to Australia with a tour and that he was accompanied by Ms X, with whom he was in a relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The letter did not state that the appellant was the source of that information, having provided it to the tour operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Nor did the s 424A letter make any reference to the information in the ADS report that the appellant was employed as a legal representative of a company (rather than as a taxi driver) in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The essential grounds of the appeal are twofold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">First, it is said that the Federal Magistrate was in error in failing to find that the Tribunal was required to give, as part of its particulars under s 424A(1) , the fact that the appellant was the source of the information about the relationship with Ms X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The second is that the Tribunal was required to give to the appellant particulars of the information about the appellant's employment in China that contradicted his claim to be a taxi driver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Failure to do so was said to be a contravention of s 424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The second question was not raised by the appellant on his application in the Federal Magistrates Court but the Minister does not object to it being raised for the first time on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Both of these grounds involve a consideration of whether the information was "information" within s 424A(1) and, if so, whether it was information that the Tribunal considered to be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">THE DELEGATE'S DECISION 
 The delegate's decision was dated 1 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The delegate referred to the appellant's claim that he was detained by local police in China for fifteen days but did not accept that he would have been able to depart China legally on a passport issued in his own name if he were of serious interest to the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The delegate stated that the appellant's performance at the interview, coupled with his written statement, led him to find that the claim lacked credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The delegate prepared a contemporaneous file note in which he addressed two matters of which he was aware but which were not included in the decision record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">One matter was the information from the ADS report that the appellant and Ms X were in a relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The other was that the appellant had provided a photograph in support of his claim of Christianity, in which one of the persons in the photograph was Ms X, even though the appellant claimed he did not know her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The file note observed that Ms X was also seeking a protection visa and that the matters referred to above may be relevant to their credibility should either of them seek a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">THE HEARING BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL ON 23 APRIL 2008 
 The Tribunal asked the appellant about the photograph referred to above and put to the appellant that the woman in the photo was the person who travelled with him to Australia, that is to say, Ms X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">However, the appellant claimed he did not know her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Tribunal asked the appellant further questions on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The most pertinent part of the transcript is at AB 178.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: For reasons of confidentiality and privacy I cannot tell you her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">But I have showed you the photo because you have provided a photo of her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

 
 APPLICANT: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: The information I have is that both of you were on the same tour, both absconded, both applied for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">She has applied on different grounds though.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">You both engaged the same migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">These similar circumstances would raise serious doubts about your claims and credibility generally [Mr SZMNP].</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The information I have [Mr SZMNP] also suggests that you and this female in the photograph are a couple intending to marry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">

 
 APPLICANT: I don't know, maybe it was a person who organised my trip here did all this, I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: Did what, what do you mean?</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">

 
 APPLICANT: Arranged by him, it has to be arranged by him but I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: What was arranged?</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I don't understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

 
 APPLICANT: That we are going to get married as a couple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I didn't know it myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: Is that what you told him?</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

 
 APPLICANT: Who?</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Him who?</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: The person who arranged your trip?</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

 
 APPLICANT: No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: What did you tell the person who arranged your trip?</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">

 
 APPLICANT: I didn't tell him anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: What did you say?</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">

 
 APPLICANT: I didn't say anything but I'm only thinking if there is such things like this it has to be arranged by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">

 
 TRIBUNAL MEMBER: I will think about what you are saying more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The evidence before me suggests that you do know the woman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">

 
 APPLICANT: No, I don't know her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">" 
 THE SECTION 424A LETTER 
 The s 424A letter included the following: 
 You appeared before the Tribunal on 23 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Tribunal discussed with you a number of concerns which include the following: 
 There is in the Departmental file a report from a third party essentially noting that you had travelled to Australia with a tour and that a female (X) with whom you are in a relationship, had travelled with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">For reasons of confidentiality and privacy, the Tribunal cannot release the name of the female.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The information before the Tribunal suggests that you had known the female for many years and that your wedding is planned for the end of the year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The information suggests that female X had also absconded, that she had applied for a protection visa (on different grounds), that she has the same residential and postal address as yourself and that she had engaged the same migration agent, Ms Weiming Qian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 This information is relevant because the above common features between your application and that of the other applicant could suggest fabrication of claims, which could raise doubts about your claims and your credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">

 You were interviewed by the Department on 6 December 2007 and during the interview, you provided a photograph showing you with five other people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In the course of the interview and the hearing, you denied knowing the female standing in the middle of the back row.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The Tribunal notes that the female whom you denied knowing bears a striking resemblance to the female with whom it is alleged that you are in a relationship and travelled with (ie female X as referred to above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Tribunal showed you a copy of the photograph of the woman, contained in the Departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 This information is relevant because your denial of knowing female X when there is information that could suggest the contrary, could raise doubts about your claims and your credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 The appellant replied to the s 424A letter, denying that he had travelled to Australia with Ms X and stating that he had no relationship with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 10 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The Tribunal's reasons included a reference to the matters raised in the s 424A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In particular, the Tribunal observed at [86] that the appellant's denial of his knowledge of Ms X raised doubts about his claims and credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The Tribunal referred at [87] to the information that the appellant had travelled to Australia with Ms X with whom he was said to be in a relationship and who he was planning to marry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Tribunal said it found the appellant's denial of any knowledge of Ms X to be unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal also said that it was: 
 ... satisfied that the common features between the applications [ie of the applicant and of Ms X] indicate fabrication of claims, raising doubts about the applicant's claims and his credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 The Federal Magistrate observed at [13] that what the appellant was submitting was that not all of the information in the ADS report had been provided to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In particular, his complaint was that he was not informed that the ADS report claimed that he had told the tour operator himself about the relationship, and that if this had been put to him, he could have had an explanation: see also [16] of the Federal Magistrate's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">His Honour said at [19] that he had difficulty in accepting that the source of the information had any relevance to the Tribunal's task, which included an assessment of the appellant's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The essence of his Honour's reasons for rejecting the submission that there was a breach of s 424A(1) is to be found at [20].</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That paragraph is as follows: 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The information which " would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review" was that a report had been received indicating an alternative motive for the applicant wishing to come to Australia and the existence of that report cast doubt upon the credibility of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The existence of the report and the reason why it might be relevant in the decision making process was clearly explained to the applicant in the s 424A letter dated 24 April 2008 [CB 104].</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The applicant provided a response [CB 106] and the Tribunal then exercised its powers to assess the credibility of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Tribunal's reasons for not accepting the credibility of the applicant in relation to this particular aspect of the matter was: 

 
 'The Tribunal is satisfied that the common features between the applications indicate fabrication of claims, raising doubts about the applicant's claims and his credibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Furthermore, this issue is one of the many concerns that the Tribunal has about this applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">' [CB 144].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 Although not raised as a ground of review, his Honour mentioned the possibility of a different beach of s 424A , namely the contradictory information about the appellant's employment which was stated in the ADS report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">However, since the appellant was represented on the application, his Honour did not consider it appropriate to deal with that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">GROUND 1: THE SOURCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP INFORMATION 
 The central question raised by the first ground is whether s 424A of the Act required the Tribunal to reveal to the appellant that an item of information in the ADS report, namely his relationship with Ms X, had apparently come from the appellant himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Even if this can be said to be "information" within s 424A , I do not consider that the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 424A(1) was enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The proper construction of s 424A(1) was referred to by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [17] ff and by a Full Court in SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 ; (2007) 164 FCR 578 at [33] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It has also been dealt with in subsequent authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">I referred to them in my decision in SZMPT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 107 ALD 121 at [13] --- [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There is some tension in the authorities as to what use, if any, can be made of the Tribunal's written reasons in determining whether s 424A(1)(a) was enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In SZMPT at [16] --- [18], I expressed the view that the Tribunal's reasons are not the starting point, but that it may be appropriate to refer to them to determine whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I accept of course that, as the High Court said in SZBYR at [17], the question is to be determined in advance of, and independently from, the Tribunal's reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">But whether one looks at the transcript of the hearing, or the Tribunal's reasons, it is plain, in my opinion, that the approach taken by the Federal Magistrate was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">As his Honour said at [20], the information which the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the decision was that a report had been received which indicated that there was a motive for the appellant wishing to come to Australia different from that which formed the basis of his application for a protection visa, and the existence of that report cast doubt upon the credibility of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">This is clear from what the Tribunal put to the appellant during the oral hearing as revealed in the passage from the transcript set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Moreover, as the Federal Magistrate went on to say at [20], the existence of the report and the reason why it may be relevant to the decision making process was clearly explained in the s 424A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It was the existence of the report and the information in it about the alternative motive for coming to Australia that was of "dispositive relevance" to the Convention claims advanced by the appellant before the Tribunal: MZXBQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 319 ; (2008) 166 FCR 483 at [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Particulars of the information and the reason why it may be relevant were given to the appellant in accordance with s 424A(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The fact that the information may have been provided in the first instance by the appellant to the tour operator was of no dispositive relevance and was not required to be supplied to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">To the extent that it is permissible to refer to the Tribunal's reasons to determine whether the Tribunal considered the source of the information to be a reason for affirming the decision, the reasons of the Tribunal, in particular at [87], support the conclusion I have reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Nothing in s 422B(3) alters this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I should add that s 422B(3) was mentioned only in passing in the appellant's submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">GROUND 2: INCONSISTENT EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION 
 This ground turns upon whether I am prepared to draw an inference that the "employment information" was information that the Tribunal considered to be a reason for affirming the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The information about the appellant's employment as legal representative of a company was referred to in the ADS report, and was contrary to the appellant's claim before the Tribunal that he was a taxi driver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">However, this inconsistency was not referred to by the Tribunal in the oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Nor was it referred to in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It follows that there is simply no evidence from which it can be inferred that this information, even assuming it to be information within s 424A(1) , was a reason for affirming the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">What seems to me to underlie the appellant's submission on this ground is that, in determining whether the Tribunal considered the information to be a reason for affirming the decision under review, the Court is required to carry out an objective assessment of what the Tribunal may have considered to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In my opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the proper construction of 
 s 424A(1)(a) and the authorities which have construed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In my view, the effect of what the High Court said in SZBYR at [17], and, in particular, of what the Full Court said in SZKLG at [33] is that the word "considers" in s 424(1)(a) is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It is true that the Court will not generally have evidence of what the Tribunal subjectively considered to be dispositively relevant, so that it will be for the Court to determine that question objectively from the available evidence, including in an appropriate case, the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">But the alternative approach suggested by the appellant would require the Court to pour over all information in the Tribunal's hands to determine what might possibly be considered to be dispositively relevant, even if the Tribunal member himself, or herself, did not consider it to have that status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In my view, this exposes the fallacy in the appellant's argument and shows why it is contrary to the proper construction of s 424A(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Again, nothing in s 422B(3) alters that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">CONCLUSION AND ORDERS 
 The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
