1 By its amended notice of motion filed on 5 December 2007, the respondent (ANZ) moves for a striking out of certain paragraphs of the amended statement of claim filed by the applicants on 26 October 2007 (ASC) and for an order that the applicants provide further and better particulars of certain paragraphs of the ASC.</sentence>

 Representations 
 
13 ANZ, in trade or commerce, made numerous false representations (the Representations) to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">[ 19-29D ]
 
14 ANZ took no steps to disabuse the applicants in relation to the Representations at any time prior to the completion of the Transaction (the term Transaction is defined at [19] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">[ 30 ] The Representations were continuing representations down to the entry into the Transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">[ 31 ]
 
15 The Representations were misleading or deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">[ 32 ]
 
16 ANZ provided financial services to Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman within the meaning of s 12BAB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ( ASIC Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">[ 34 ] Some of the Representations were representations wholly or partly with respect to a future matter or future matters for the purposes of s 51A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( TP Act ) and s 12BB of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">[ 35 ]
 
17 By reason of the matters pleaded in paras 18A to 35 of the ASC, ANZ engaged in conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act and s 12DA of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">[ 36 ]
 The Transaction 
 
18 Upon completion of the Transaction (the term Transaction is defined at [19] below), Newco paid ANZPE a $4.6 million transaction fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">[ 36A ]
 
19 On 1 May 2003, in reliance on the Representations: 
 
 (a) Mr Chapman bought 333,333 ordinary shares in Newco for $333,333; 
 
 
 (b) Mrs Chapman bought 2,611,111 convertible preference shares in Newco for $2,611,111; and
 (c) Geomar lent $4,055,556 to Newco pursuant to a "Shareholders' Loan Agreement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 

(together, the Transaction), by reason of which the applicants have suffered loss and damage as set out later in the ASC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">(my emphasis) [ 37 ]
 
20 Further or in the alternative to para 37 of the ASC:
 
(a) as a result of reliance by Ken Chapman and Helen Chapman on the Representations, Mr Chapman entered into the aspect of the Transaction referred to in para 37(a) of the ASC (as set out at [19](a) above);
 
(b) as a result of reliance by Mr Chapman, Ken Chapman and Helen Chapman on the Representations, Mrs Chapman entered into the aspect of the Transaction referred to in para 37(b) of the ASC (as set out at [19](b) above); and
 
(c) as a result of reliance by Mr Chapman, Ken Chapman and Helen Chapman on the Representations, Geomar entered into the aspect of the Transaction referred to in para 37(c) of the ASC (as set out at [19](c) above), 
 
 by reason of which, the applicants have suffered loss and damage as set out later in the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">[ 37A ] 

21 By virtue of the matters referred to in paras 37 and 37A of the ASC, each of the applicants suffered loss or damage "as a result of entering into the Transaction, including loss and damage on a loss of opportunity basis, as set out in paragraphs 52 to 57 [of the ASC]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">[ 37B ] 
 
22 (I digress from this account of the ASC to note a key issue that arises on the strike out aspect of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Later paragraphs of the ASC plead that the applicants took various steps subsequent to the Transaction on 1 May 2003 (the Post Transaction Steps) and that this caused them further losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The applicants submit that the ASC makes it clear that the pleaded claim is of a "no transaction" case, that is to say, that but for the Representations, the Transaction would not have taken place at all, with the result that the further losses the applicants suffered as a result of the Post Transaction Steps would not have been suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">ANZ, on the other hand, submits that the ASC does not adequately plead a causal link between the Representations, and the Post Transaction Steps and losses suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">) 
 The applicants' attempts to mitigate their loss 
 
23 On or about 9 January 2004 the directors of Newco identified the need for an immediate cash injection of $4 million into Newco because the revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Newco had not been as represented to the applicants by ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">[ 38 ] Newco's future profitability and revenue would suffer without continuing financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">[ 39 ] On or about 16 January 2004, at Newco's request, Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman provided a subordinated loan to Newco of $1,228,985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">[ 40 ] On or about 9 July 2004, at Newco's request, Mr Chapman provided further financial support to Newco by subscribing for $1,300,000 worth of shares in Newco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">[ 41 ]
 The applicants' internal debt/equity restructure 
 
24 On 3 September 2004, Geomar transferred $3,518,676 of the debt owed to it by Newco to Mr Chapman (the Internal Transfer) for which Mr Chapman paid Geomar a consideration of $3,518,676.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">[ 42 ] (This would leave $536,880 owing to Geomar --- see para 37 of the ASC summarised at [19] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">)
 
25 On 30 June 2005, all shares held in Newco by, and debts owed by Newco to, Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman were assigned to Helebeth for a nominal consideration of $10 per entity (the Internal Assignment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">[ 43] (It will be recalled that Mr Chapman had acquired $333,333 worth of ordinary shares on 1 May 2003 (see para 37 of the ASC summarised at [19] above) and $1,300,000 worth of shares on 9 July 2004 (see para 41 of the ASC summarised at [23] above); that Mrs Chapman had acquired $2,622,222 worth of convertible preference shares on 1 May 2003 (see para 37 of the ASC summarised at [19] above); that Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman had provided a subordinated loan of $1,228,985 to Newco on 16 January 2004 (see para 40 of the ASC summarised at [23] above); and that by the Internal Transfer on 3 September 2004 Mr Chapman had acquired $3,518,676 of the debt owed by Newco to Geomar (see para 42 of the ASC summarised at [24] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In the result, Helebeth would own $4,255,555 worth of shares in Newco, and $4,747,661 of indebtedness owed by Newco).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">ANZ forced restructure of Newco and further loss of Chapman assets 
 
26 On 14 June 2005, ANZ required Newco to be restructured, with the result that the applicants would hold only 15% of Newco's shares and 15% of the subordinated debt (the Restructure).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">[ 44 ] The Restructure would substantially reduce the applicants' and ANZPE's shareholdings and economic interests in Newco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">[ 45 ]
 
27 Between June 2005 and December 2005, ANZ informed the applicants that unless they accepted the terms of the proposed restructure, ANZ would appoint receivers (with the consequences that all of the applicants' and Helebeth's investments would be lost and substantial damage would be caused to Mr Chapman's personal reputation and creditworthiness).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">[ 46 ]
 
28 On or about 23 December 2005 the applicants and Helebeth agreed to the Restructure in order to mitigate their losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Particulars are said to be found in an agreement dated 22 December 2005 (the Amendment Agreement) and a restructure deed dated 23 December 2005 (the Deed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">[ 47 ]
 
29 Under the terms of the Deed, Newco owes the applicants and Helebeth the following debts: 
(a) $815,000 for a term loan made by Geomar calculated as follows:
 
 
 
 (i) $1,315,000 (being the interest accrued on the loan of $4,055,556 from 1 May 2003 to 30 June 2004 of $763,120 together with the amount preserved in the restructure of $536,880 plus interest accrued of $15,000);
 (ii) less a principal payment of $250,000 made on or about 3 July 2006; and
 (iii) less a further principal payment of $250,000 made on or about 2 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 (b) $3,600,000, being a subordinated, non-interest bearing debt owed to Helebeth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">[ 48 ] 

30 Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, Newco owes the applicants and Helebeth interest pursuant to Exhibit A of the Amendment Agreement (the Loan Agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">[ 49 ]
 
31 Under the Deed, the applicants were required by ANZ to forgive all other debts owed to them by Newco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">[ 50 ]
 
32 Helebeth has retained 1,571,251 ordinary shares, representing a 15% shareholding in Newco under the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">[ 51 ] The applicants were required to transfer the remainder of their shares for a total consideration of $1 to SPV1G Pty Limited (SPV1G), a subsidiary of Korda Mentha, established by ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">[ 51 ]
 Loss and damage suffered by the applicants 
 
33 But for the misleading or deceptive conduct and negligence of ANZ, the applicants would not have entered into the Transaction and would not have become a co-investor in, or co-financier of, Newco, or suffered further losses because of reasonable attempts to mitigate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">[ 52 ]
 
34 As at the date of the Internal Assignment to Helebeth on 30 June 2005, the shares in Newco (now held by Helebeth) and the subordinated non-interest bearing debt owed by Newco to Helebeth, "were worth substantially less than what was paid for them (if anything at all)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">[ 53 ]
 
35 If Geomar had not invested in Newco, it would have deployed those funds by investing them in shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Other funds held by Geomar at all material times were so invested and achieved the average rate of return shown in a table to para 54 of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In the circumstances, Geomar claims: 
 
 (i) a loss being equal to 23% per annum (being the average rate of return for the years 2003-2004 as shown in the table to para 54 of the ASC) on the sum invested by Geomar, namely, $4,055,556 (lent by Geomar to Newco) between 1 May 2003 and 3 September 2004 (the date of the sale of part of the debt, namely, $3,518,676, to Mr Chapman); and
 (ii) interest of 29% per annum (being the average rate of return for the years 2004-2005 as shown in the table to para 54 of the ASC) on the balance of $536,880 between 3 September 2004 and 31 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">[ 54 ] 

36 Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman claim interest at the prevailing pre-judgment interest rate in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">[ 55 ]
 
37 At the date of commencement of this proceeding (12 June 2007) the applicants calculated their damages as set out in a table to para 56 of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">According to the particulars to that paragraph, the total amount claimed by the applicants as damages is $13,198,682.38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">[ 56 , 57 ].</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">38 The amounts in the table to para 56 of the ASC in fact totalled $17,739,238.38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On the hearing, counsel for the applicants submitted a substituted table (the Substitute Table), a copy of which is annexed to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The amounts in the right hand column of the Substitute Table,, total $13,183,682.38, which corresponds to the total amount claimed by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">CONSIDERATION OF THE ASPECT OF THE MOTION TO STRIKE OUT PARAS 37, 37A, 37B, 53, 56 AND 57 OF THE ASC 
 General 
 
39 I will not discuss the legal principles governing the adequacy of a pleading: I discussed them in Collex Waste Management Pty Ltd v Waste Recycling &amp; Processing Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 213 and Australian Automotive Repairers' Association (Political Action Committee) Inc v NRMA Insurance Ltd [2002] FCA 1568.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Reference may be made also to Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1996) ATPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">40 It suffices to ask here whether the applicants have made clear to ANZ and to the Court the nature of the claim they propound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">41 Prior to the filing of the notice of motion on 23 November 2007 (it is noted that an amended notice of motion was filed on 5 December 2007), there was correspondence between Freehills, the solicitors for ANZ, and Atanaskovic Hartnell, the solicitors for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">This culminated in the writing of a letter dated 21 November 2007 by Atanaskovic Hartnell to Freehills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In that letter Atanaskovic Hartnell explained that the claim of each of the applicants was put on the basis that but for the misleading or deceptive conduct of ANZ, that applicant would not have entered into the Transaction and would not have been a co-investor in, or a co-financier of, Newco, and would not have suffered any further losses by reason of reasonable attempts to mitigate their loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">42 In that letter, Atanaskovic Hartnell said that the case was brought on the basis that it was a "no transaction" case The "basis for the losses" of the applicants were set out as follows:
 
 George Chapman 
 
 
 
 In relation to the 333,333 ordinary shares in Newco purchased on 1 May 2003 at a cost of $333,333, and the subordinated loan provided by him (jointly with Mrs Chapman) on or about 16 January 2004 in the sum of $1,228,985, and the additional $1,300,000 worth of shares in Newco acquired on or about 9 July 2005, Mr Chapman's claim is that on the dates of these acquisitions and/or advance of funds, or alternatively the date or dates of transfer to Helebeth, the value of these interests was in fact zero, and the loss suffered by Mr Chapman in respect of these shares and loans is the difference between what was paid or advanced, and zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In addition, Mr Chapman acquired from Geomar $3,518,676 of the debt owed by Newco to Geomar on or about 3 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Mr Chapman would not have acquired that debt from Geomar had it not been for consequences that flowed directly from the misrepresentations and negligence of ANZ that caused Geomar to enter into the Transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The loss claimed is the difference between what Mr Chapman paid Geomar ($3,518,676) and the value of that debt as at the time of acquisition of the debt, alternatively at the time of transfer of that debt to Helebeth, namely zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 
 Margo Chapman 
 
 
 In respect of the shares acquired by Mrs Chapman in Newco and in respect of the loans made by Mrs Chapman to Newco, the same basis for the loss as set out above in relation to Mr Chapman applies to Mrs Chapman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 
 Geomar 
 Geomar's loss comprises: 
 
 
 (a) lost opportunity to earn 23% on the sum invested by Geomar being $4,055,556 between 1 May 2003 and 3 September 2004;
 (b) lost opportunity to earn 29% on the balance following acquisition of part of the debt by Mr Chapman on 3 September 2004, leaving a balance of $536,880 for the period between 3 September 2004 and 31 December 2005 (at which time Geomar transferred its interest in the debt to Helebeth);
 (c) the loss of the principal sum of $536,880 on the basis that as at the date of the advance by Geomar to Newco of those moneys the true value of the debt acquired was nil, alternatively as at the date of transfer of interest to Helebeth by Geomar, the true value of the $536,800 debt was nil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In relation to your questions as to identification of the quantum of the loss claimed in respect of each of the applicants, the quantum of the loss claimed is identified in the table in the particulars to paragraph 56 of the further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 

43 The applicants say in their submissions that the reference to a transfer by Geomar of its interest in the debt to Helebeth was an error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">44 As appears below, I have come to the view that, even taking into account the matters stated in the letter, the ASC is deficient and the applicant should have leave to re-plead by filing a further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In that further amended statement of claim, matters of the kind referred to in the letter of 21 November 2007 should be included in the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">45 On the hearing, counsel for the applicants also indicated that the words "and negligence" in para 52 of the ASC had been included by error and should be omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">These words should likewise be omitted in the further amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">46 The substantial issue between the parties on the strike out application can be outlined as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">ANZ points out that according to para 31 of the ASC, the Representations were continuing representations down to the entry into the Transaction on 1 May 2003 and, by implication, not beyond that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Accordingly, a question arises as to the basis on which it is claimed that ANZ is liable in respect of the further losses incurred as a result of the Post Transaction Steps taken by the respective applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">47 The applicants emphasised that paras 37, 37A and 37B of the ASC show that the claim as pleaded is a claim of a "no transaction" case, that is to say, that absent the Representations the Transaction would not have been entered into, so that the applicants could not have taken the further steps which led to their incurring the further post-1 May 2003 losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">48 I accept that there is more than one permissible way in which the applicants are entitled to put their case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">That the applicants were induced directly by the Representations to take the Post Transaction Steps that they allegedly took is only one of those ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I accept that they may be entitled to recover damages in respect of losses resulting from the Post Transaction Steps if they took those steps reasonably in an attempt to mitigate loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Thus, a person who has been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct to enter into a transaction may be entitled to recover losses incurred as a result of his or her reasonably taking steps to mitigate loss, even though by the time of taking them the person was aware of the true facts, so that the misleading or deceptive effect of the conduct had ceased to be operative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It all depends on the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">49 The deficiency in the present pleading, however, is that it does not make it clear what the connection is between the Post Transaction Steps and the losses incurred as a result of the Post Transaction Steps on the one hand, and the entry into the Transaction on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">50 Counsel for the applicants did not suggest a case based on the claim that the Representations continued to operate after 1 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It is consistent with the ASC that the applicants became aware of the misleading and deceptive nature of the Representations the moment after the Transaction was entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It is not enough, however, in my view simply to emphasise that the claim is of a "no transaction" case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It must also be made clear on the pleading that there was a causal link between the situation in which the applicants found themselves in consequence of having entered into the Transaction and the Post Transactions Steps and associated losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">51 The only arguable pleadings of causal link in the ASC are the following:
 
 
 
 para 37: "... by reason of which the [applicants] have suffered loss and damages set out below"
 
 para 37B: "By virtue of the matters pleaded in paragraphs 37 and 37A above, each of the [applicants] suffered loss or damage as a result of entering into the Transaction, including loss and damage on a loss of opportunity basis, as set out in paragraphs 52 and 57 below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">"
 
 para 38: "... the need for an immediate cash injection of $4.0 million in addition to which funds would also be required to deal with exiting shareholders"
 
 para 39: "Given the factors referred to in paragraph 38 above, Newco's future profitability and revenue would suffer without continuing financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">"
 
 para 46: "Between June 2005 and December 2005, ANZ informed the [applicants] that, unless they accepted the terms of the proposed restructure, ANZ would appoint receivers (with the consequences being that all of the [applicants'] and Helebeth's investment would be lost and substantial damage would be caused to Mr Chapman's personal reputation and creditworthiness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">para 47: On or about 23 December 2005 the [applicants] and Helebeth agreed to the restructure proposed by ANZ in order to mitigate their losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 
 
 What is missing is a sufficiently precise statement of facts showing that it was reasonable for the applicants to take the various Post Transaction Steps that they say they took, in each case for (as I understand it) the purpose of minimising their loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">

52 Perhaps the clearest example of the omission is to be found in paras 42 and 43 of the ASC (as summarised at [24] and [25] above), but even in relation to the other steps taken, there should be pleaded the circumstances in which the applicants found themselves prior to taking the step in question that made it reasonable for them to take it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">53 The alternative, which I reject, but which the applicants seem to support, is that any losses that the applicants suffered as a result of any post Transaction dealings by the applicants with the shares and debt are to be compensated for by ANZ on the basis that those steps could not have been taken but for the Transaction because the applicants would not have owned the shares in Newco and would not have been owed the debt by Newco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">54 I turn now to the parties' submissions, which were structured around issues raised in ANZ's submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Damages in respect of "acquisition" of debt by Mr Chapman 
 
55 According to the Substitute Table, Mr Chapman claims to recover $3,518,676.00 plus interest on that sum from 3 September 2004 (the date of the Internal Transfer) to 12 June 2007 (the date of commencement of the proceeding).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It will be recalled that the Internal Transfer was pleaded in para 42 of the ASC, and alleged that Mr Chapman paid Geomar $3,518,676 in consideration of the transfer by Geomar to him of $3,518,676 of the debt of $4,055,556 that Newco owed to Geomar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">56 In their letter dated 21 November 2007, Atanaskovic Hartnell claimed that Mr Chapman would not have acquired the indebtedness of $3,518,676 from Geomar "had it not been for consequences that flowed directly from the misrepresentations...of ANZ that caused Geomar to enter into the Transaction" and that "[t]he loss claimed is the difference between what Mr Chapman paid Geomar ($3,518,676) and the value of that debt as at the time of acquisition of the debt...namely zero".</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">57 The letter seems to suggest that Newco had no assets with which to satisfy, in whole or in part, a debt of $3,518,676, and that Mr Chapman paid $3,518,676 to Geomar for nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">On their face, such facts would suggest the possibility that Mr Chapman may have a remedy against Geomar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">58 In their submissions, the applicants assert that Atanaskovic Hartnell's letter of 21 November 2007 makes it clear that Mr Chapman would not have acquired the debt from Geomar "had it not been for consequences that flowed directly from the misrepresentations of ANZ that caused Geomar to enter into the Transaction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This suggests that the Representations did continue to be operative after 1 May 2003 and were a direct cause, rather than an indirect cause, of the Internal Transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">59 It may be that when Mr Chapman paid $3,518,676 to Geomar on 3 September 2004 for an assignment of part of the debt owed to Geomar by Newco, Mr Chapman suffered a loss of the entire sum of $3,518,676 by reason of his having entered into the Transaction induced by the misleading or deceptive Representations made by ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">However the ASC does not plead material facts showing either a direct causal link back to the Representations or a causal link back to the entry into the Transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Damages in respect of shares acquired and loans made by Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman 
 
60 According to the Substitute Table, Mr Chapman claims $333, 333.00 and interest on that sum from 1 May 2003 (the date of the Transaction) to 12 June 2007 (the date of commencement of the proceeding), while Mrs Chapman claims $2,611,111.00 and interest on that sum for the same period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It will be recalled that the amounts mentioned were the amounts that Mr Chapman paid on 1 May 2003 to purchase 333,333 ordinary shares in Newco, and that Mrs Chapman paid on the same date to purchase 2,611,111 convertible preference shares in Newco, respectively, in each case as part of the Transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">61 In their letter of 21 November 2007, Atanaskovic Hartnell assert that the value of the shares in Newco so purchased by Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman was, in each case zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Counsel for the applicants correctly points out that para 53 of the ASC states that at the date of the Internal Assignment (to Helebeth on 30 June 2005 as pleaded in para 43 of the ASC), the shares in Newco were worth substantially less than what was paid for them "if anything at all".</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He makes the point that these last words contemplate the possibility of a value of zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is not clear, however, why responsibility for a fall in value down to zero between 1 May 2003 and 30 June 2005 should be assigned to ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">If the applicants case is that the fall in value was not ANZ's fault except indirectly, in the sense that the initial acquisition of the shares in Newco was induced by the Representations and for that reason alone the measure of Mr Chapman's and Mrs Chapman's recoverable losses is the fall in value due to market forces, this should be made clear on the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">62 If the shares were worth zero at 30 June 2005, it is understandable that Mr Chapman and Mrs Chapman sold their shares to Helebeth on that date for a nominal consideration of $10 per entity (see para 43 of the ASC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The problem is that no material facts are pleaded showing any connection between the Transaction on 1 May 2003 and the zero value of the shares a little over two years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I should make it clear that by "connection" I include what may be the ultimate case on which the applicants intend to rely, namely, that the Transaction placed them in situations at different times in which they were forced to take steps in, what they reasonably believed represented, their best interests at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Material facts constituting a case of that kind however, must be pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Damages in respect of loan made by Geomar 
 
63 According to the Substitute Table, Geomar claims interest on $4,055,556.00 from 1 May 2003 to 3 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Geomar also claims $536,880.00 and interest on that sum from 3 September 2004 to 31 December 2005 (less repayments of $500,000 as referred to below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It will be recalled that on 3 September 2004 Geomar transferred $3,518,676 of the debt of $4,055,556 owed to it by Newco to Mr Chapman in return for payment of $3,518,676, leaving Newco owing $536,880.00 to Geomar thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">According to the Substitute Table, interest of $1,257,331.50 accrued on $4,055,556 from 1 May 2003 to 3 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Interest of $206,882.52 accrued on the sum of $536,880.00 from 3 September 2004 to 31 December 2005, making a total of principal and interest of $743,762.52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">A footnote to the Substitute Table records that $250,000 was paid on 3 July 2006 and a further $250,000 on 2 January 2007 (these payments are pleaded in para 48 of the ASC as summarised at [29] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Those two payments total $500,000 and, when deducted from $743,762.52, leave a balance of $243,762.52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">That amount plus the interest of $1,257,331.50 makes a total sum of $1,501,094.02, which is claimed by Geomar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">As I understand it, the applicants say that this description of the loss represents the claim made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">64 I have difficulty, however, in reconciling the position described with para 48 of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Why does interest cease to accrue at 31 December 2005?</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">According to Atanaskovic Hartnell's letter of 21 November 2007, Geomar transferred the debt to Helebeth on 31 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This would explain why no interest accrued beyond that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">However, as previously mentioned at [43] above, the applicants concede that Geomar did not transfer the debt to Helebeth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">65 Whatever the true claim, the ASC should state it clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">It does not do so at present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">66 In principle there is no difficulty in the applicants complaining that, having been induced by ANZ's misleading or deceptive conduct to enter into the Transaction, they lost all the money they paid at the time of doing so, and there is no difficulty in the applicants seeking to recover that money with interest, whether based on Hungerfords v Walker [1989] HCA 8 ; (1989) 171 CLR 125 or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">However, the ASC should plead facts showing that the applicants claim that they got nothing in return for the money paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It is not suggested, for example, that Newco did not become legally indebted to Geomar for the sum of $4,055,556 which it lent to Newco on 1 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I presume that immediately following the loan, Newco was able to repay it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Some facts to the effect that Newco ceased to be able to repay the loan at some time should be pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The amounts claimed by the applicants 
 
67 Paras 56 and 57 of the ASC set out the amounts claimed by "the Chapmans" (the ASC uses that expression to refer to the applicants).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">ANZ complains that para 57 of the ASC is embarrassing because it asserts that the applicants, without distinguishing between them, claim the amount of $13,183,682.38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">68 In their submissions, the applicants reply that the letter dated 21 November 2007 from Atanaskovic Hartnell, coupled with the Substitute Table (that is annexed to these reasons for judgment), adequately identifies the amounts claimed by the respective applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">69 I agree with counsel for the applicants that the letter dated 21 November 2007 from Atanaskovic Hartnell coupled with the Substitute Table makes it clear what the amount of each applicant's individual claim is, but it remains true that paras 56 and 57 of the ASC are embarrassing and should be amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Those paragraphs suggest a liability of ANZ to all of the applicants jointly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">In truth, there are four several claims as the Substitute Table demonstrates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Paragraphs 56 and 57 should reflect this position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">CONSIDERATION OF THE FURTHER AND BETTER PARTICULARS ASPECT OF THE MOTION 
 General 
 
70 Again, the legal principles governing the supply of further and better particulars are not in controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">I need not refer to the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">It may be said that the object of particulars is to inform a party more fully of the nature of the case to be met as distinct from stating the bare facts sufficient to constitute the claim as a claim cognisable in law, and, of course, from the evidence to be adduced in support of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">71 ANZ seeks particulars in two categories:
 
(a) particulars of the oral Representations pleaded in paras 19, 21A, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the ASC; and
 
(b) in respect of each of the subparagraphs of para 29D of the ASC, the factual matters said to give rise to the alleged failure on the part of ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">In Goldsmith v Sandilands [2002] HCA 31 ; (2002) 190 ALR 370 at 371, Gleeson CJ stated:
 
 The facts in issue in a civil action case emerged from the pleadings, which, in turn, are framed in the light of the legal principles governing the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Facts relevant to facts in issue emerge from the particulars and the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The function of particulars is not to expand the issues defined by the pleadings, but "to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial" ( Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">
 Particulars of the Representations pleaded in paras 19, 21A, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the ASC 
 
72 In relation to each of the Representations pleaded in the paragraphs identified, ANZ seeks an order that the applicants specify:
 
 
 (a) whether the Representation is alleged to have been made orally; and
 (b) if it is alleged that the Representation was made orally;
 (i) when it was made;
 (ii) by whom it was made; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) to whom it was made; 
 
 
 
 
 (c) whether the Representation is alleged to have been of a present fact or as to an opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">
 

73 I do not think that ANZ is entitled to require the applicants to categorise the alleged Representations as being as to present fact or as to an opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">No doubt, there will be submissions on the final hearing as to the proper characterisation of particular Representations for the purpose of s 51A of the TP Act and s 12BB of the ASIC Act , but I do not think that characterisation at this stage is necessary in order to enable ANZ to file its defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">74 The applicants point out that a reading of the paragraphs complained of makes it plain that in so far as oral Representations are concerned, the relevant period during which they were made was the very limited period commencing in March 2003 and ending on 1 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Further, in each instance, the person to whom the Representation was made is identified as being one or more (as identified in each case) of Mr Chapman, Helen Chapman or Ken Chapman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">75 Finally, the applicants submit that the maker of the Representation is also clearly identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">As to the large majority, it is pleaded that it was Mr Dudurovic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The ASC identifies Mr Rade Dudurovic as having been at all material times the Director, Regional Investment Banking and Private Equity, of ANZPE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Another maker of some of the Representations who is referred to in some instances is Mr Graeme Thomas, whom the ASC identifies as having been at all material times the Relationship Manager for ANZ in Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">76 Order 12 r 5(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides that the Court shall not make an order for a party to file and serve particulars before the filing of the defence unless, in the opinion of the Court, the order is necessary or desirable to enable the respondent to plead or for some other special reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">77 The applicants submit that by seeking the order for particulars, ANZ is seeking to impose on the applicants the task of gathering together the level of detailed information that it would ordinarily not otherwise have to do until preparation of its evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">78 It has been suggested that in contemporary commercial litigation, where there will inevitably be a direction for the filing and service of affidavits or witness statements, the necessity for lengthy particulars may be viewed with disfavour: Police and Nurses Credit Society Ltd v Burgess Rowson (WA) Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1395 at [17] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">79 I have read carefully paras 19, 21A, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the ASC and I am of the view that the particulars already provided are adequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In each case, it is said that in so far as the Representations in question were oral, they were made in "a conversation", "a discussion", "various discussions" or "several discussions", between a named person on behalf of ANZPE and one or more named persons on behalf of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">As well, either a particular date or a confined period is stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">80 I do not think that ANZ needs more to enable it to file its defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Particulars of falsity --- subparagraphs of para 29D of the ASC 
 
81 Paragraph 29D of the ASC pleads falsity of the "Due Diligence Representations" referred to in paras 29(a), 29(c)-(h), 29(j) and 29C of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In each case it is pleaded that ANZ did not do the things the subject of those Representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">82 ANZ submits that taken individually and cumulatively, the allegations in para 29D are so broad as to attack every aspect of ANZ's conduct prior to the Transaction of 1 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">ANZ submits that in order to plead to these paragraphs, it would need to satisfy itself that every aspect of the due diligence process was completed "properly and adequately", "including" the "commercial, management, account, legal, taxation and insurance" due diligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">ANZ submits that it is oppressive that it should be required to undertake such an exercise, and that the applicants should be required to identify those respects in which they say the due diligence exercise was flawed before ANZ is required to plead to the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">83 For their part, the applicants submit that it should be borne in mind that the due diligence process was conducted and coordinated by ANZ on behalf of itself and the applicants, and that the applicants do not have available to them all the detailed information about the due diligence process that will be likely to be available to them on discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">84 Notwithstanding this, I think that the applicants should be required to do more than they have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">If they are truly unable to give any particulars at all, a question arises as to the basis on which the allegation of a deficiency in the due diligence process has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">I accept the applicants' submission that they may be in a position to provide further and better particulars following discovery, but they must surely have some more precise notion at present of the failure on the part of ANZ on which they will rely, beyond the generalisations contained in para 29D of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">85 Accordingly, I think that there should be an order for the provision of the best further and better particulars of the kind as sought in para 2 of Sch 1 to the amended notice of motion that the applicants are presently able to give.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">CONCLUSION 
 
86 ANZ has succeeded in relation to the strike out aspect of its motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It would be possible simply to make an order that particular paragraphs of the ASC be struck out, but inevitably this would have implications for the remainder of the ASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I think that my reasons above will make it clear what is required to fix the pleading, and that the better course is to strike out the amended statement of claim in total and grant the applicants leave to re-plead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">This course will permit the applicants to improve the pleading by taking into account other matters mentioned in the course of the hearing, 
 
87 The applicants have succeeded in resisting the first part of the motion relating to further and better particulars, while ANZ has succeeded on the latter part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">88 My present disposition is to order the applicants to pay two thirds of ANZ's cost of the motion, but I will give the parties an opportunity to make submissions on costs if they wish to seek a different order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">I certify that the preceding eighty-eight (88) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
