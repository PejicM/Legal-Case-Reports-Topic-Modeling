<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The Appellants, who are married, are citizens of India and arrived in Australia on 12 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 They applied to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 11 July 2006 for Protection (Class XA) Visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The husband claimed to be a refugee and the wife was included within that application as a member of the same family unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">A delegate refused to grant the visas on 26 July 2006 and on 17 August 2006 an application for review was filed with the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The Tribunal conducted a hearing on 16 November 2006 and affirmed the decision not to grant the visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The husband alone attended that hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal handed down its decision on 12 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The Federal Magistrates Court on 12 September 2007 dismissed an application to review the decision of the Tribunal: SZJXP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1603.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Appellants now appeal to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">5 A Notice of Appeal was filed on 24 September 2007 and an Amended Notice of Appeal was filed on 1 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It is understood that the Grounds of Appeal upon which the Appellants wish to proceed may be summarised as being:
 
(i) jurisdictional error; 
 
(ii) bias on the part of the Tribunal; and 
 
(iii) a failure to comply with s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">None of these grounds has been made out and the appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 The Appellants appeared before this Court unrepresented, although they had the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">JURISDICTIONAL ERROR &amp; BIAS 
 
7 The Notice of Appeal is but a bare assertion that there has been jurisdictional error; the Amended Notice of Appeal attempts to give greater substance to the contentions sought to be advanced and annexes what are said to be " particulars ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">That annexure, however, as filed is obviously incomplete as it appears to be (at least) the second page of a document -- it commences with what is assumed to be part of paragraph [5] and thereafter sets forth paragraphs numbered [6] and [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The complete version of the annexure, however, is to be found on the Federal Magistrates Court file of the proceedings before that Court and it is upon the basis of that complete version that the present appeal proceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">8 The contentions of the Appellants seem to be that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error because (in summary form):
 
(a) it made contradictory findings and refused to accept that there were " inter-religious problems in all parts of India including in Delhi "; 
 
(b) it " ignore [ed]" the fact that there were groups that " will locate the Applicant's whereabouts and will subject him to severe harm leading to murder "; 
 
(c) it " constructively failed to perceive the Applicant's personal circumstances and relied on the concept that the vast majority of Indians live in harmony with people of all faiths and hence he could relocate away from Kerala "; and 
 
(d) it failed to offer another date for hearing by reason of the Tribunal member being unwell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">9 The first two contentions fail at the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The alleged contradictory findings were not further identified -- it is, accordingly, difficult to further consider this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Moreover, it is not considered that the Tribunal " ignore [ed]" any of the claims that were advanced for consideration by the now Appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">10 The findings ultimately made by the Tribunal were as follows:
 The Tribunal accepts that inter-faith violence, including Hindu attacks on Christians, occurs sporadically in India and that the husband applicant may well have suffered in Kerala as he claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, the Tribunal finds it would be reasonable in the applicants' particular circumstances to relocate to another city such as New Delhi where they might live safely and where the Catholic Church is well established and where they might pursue their faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal finds the independent evidence cited above ("The vast majority of Indians of every religious faith lived in peaceful coexistence") supports a finding that the applicant's claim that inter-religious violence exists throughout India not to be credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Further, the Tribunal does not find as credible the husband applicant's claim that he would be pursued across India, even to New Delhi, by those in Kerala who have harmed him in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal finds that there is considerable evidence that New Delhi, the national capital, is a well-ordered city (http://delhigovt.nic.in/) and the Tribunal has before it no evidence that speaks of inter-religious violence there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In the light of the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicants have a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Therefore the Tribunal finds their fear is not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">11 A variant of the first two submissions is a further contention advanced by the Appellants that the " RRT did not address in their findings of fact that how my wife and I could relocate elsewhere in India without continuing to face a risk of persecution based on my Convention claims ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">12 The findings of fact made by the Tribunal were findings open to it given the account of the evidence and claims previously set forth in its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Parliament has determined that ordinarily the Tribunal is to be the final arbiter of the merits of an application, and not the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 558.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">No jurisdictional error is exposed in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Even a wrong finding of fact alone does not constitute an error of law: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [137] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 560 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">13 The Appellants' complaint is properly characterised as dissatisfaction with the findings made by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Nowhere is this more apparent than in the " particulars " provided, which asserted in part:
 (4) [The Tribunal failed] to accept the fact that the Applicant tried to relocate to another part of India but failed to lead a life without the fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">(5) ... the Tribunal failed to accept the fact that the Applicant would face serious harm if he returns back to India even after he was ordered to leave the country by the above criminal elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The task of accepting or rejecting evidence, and weighing such evidence that is available, is a task entrusted by the legislature to the Tribunal alone -- it is not a task that can be undertaken by either the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court on appeal: cf Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">14 Nor is there any substance in the contention that the Tribunal erred by not offering another date for hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Before the Federal Magistrates Court, and before this Court, there was a copy of the transcript of the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">At the outset of that hearing the Tribunal member said:
 "Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I have lost my voice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">We will begin by having the interpreter promise not to divulge any information he hears during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" 
Two questions thereafter, the Member again stated:
 "I have lost my voice unclear interpret You wife hasn't attended today" 
The hearing started at 1:46pm and concluded at 2:11pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Nothing in the transcript reveals anything further being said in respect of the Tribunal member being unwell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Furthermore, nothing in the transcript gives any support to a submission found in the " particulars " that the Tribunal proceeded " in haste ", had any " pre-conceived notion ", or had not given " the Applicant the opportunity to reply to the Tribunal ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Rather than proceeding " in haste " and not extending such an " opportunity to reply ", the transcript records the following exchange at the conclusion of the hearing:
 [SZJXP]: I don't want to go back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">[Tribunal member]: I understand that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I will have to think about what you have said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Ok.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Anything else you want to say?</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">[SZJXP]: I am just asking my life back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Rather than being dismissed " in haste " and not giving the First Appellant an " opportunity to reply ", the Tribunal member quite properly invited him to add to the matters which had been covered if he so wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">15 The present contention that the Tribunal member should have adjourned due to his being unwell is both curious and factually unsupportable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is curious to the extent that a failure to accede to a reasonable request for an adjournment can constitute procedural unfairness: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 at [40] , 209 CLR 597 at 611 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Further, proceedings of the Refugee Review Tribunal have been held to have denied procedural fairness where an adjournment should have been granted: Xiang Sheng Li v Refugee Review Tribunal [1994] FCA 1550 ; (1994) 36 ALD 273.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">16 Normally it is the party appearing who makes the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">No application was made by the now First Appellant for the proceedings to be adjourned to another date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Nor did the Tribunal member suggest that it was necessary for the proceedings to be adjourned or stood over to another day for hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">There was no suggestion on the part of the Tribunal member and there is certainly no other evidence to suggest that the Tribunal member was so unwell that he was not able to entertain the evidence and arguments being presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Circumstances may possibly be envisaged in which a Tribunal member proceeds to hearing where he is so unwell that he thereby effectively denies a party an opportunity to be heard, or where it may reasonably be perceived that he has done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">But such a conclusion in the present case is factually unsupportable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">All that the Tribunal member said was " I have lost my voice ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To proceed from that statement to a conclusion that an effective opportunity to be heard was not extended to the now First Appellant is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">17 One submission made by the Appellants during the course of the hearing of the appeal, by means of the interpreter, was that further time should have been taken by the Tribunal in conducting the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It was contended that 25 minutes was an inadequate opportunity to allow the now First Appellant to present his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">An order was sought remitting the proceedings to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Whether such an order could or even should be made by this Court -- even if there be appellable error in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate -- may be left to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The utility in remitting the proceedings to the Tribunal, it was understood, was to permit the Appellants to place before the Tribunal further documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Included within that material was what was described as a " summons " (dated 6 March 2006) and a " warrant " (dated 25 May 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Those documents, it was said, were not available at the date of the Tribunal hearing in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">18 The situation of claimants appearing before the Tribunal, it is considered, must be approached with some considerable understanding as to the circumstances in which they find themselves: Taylor S, Informational Deficiencies Affecting Refugee Status Determinations: Sources and Solutions (1994) 13 U Tas LR 43; Kneebone S, The Refugee Review Tribunal and the Assessment of Credibility: an Inquisitorial Role?</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">(1998) 5 AJ Admin L 78.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">They are unrepresented and facing an administrative hearing of fundamental importance to their future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">But, in the present proceedings, the now First Appellant husband made a detailed submission to the Tribunal by letter received on 12 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">There is no reference in that written submission to the prospect of placing further documents before the Tribunal, other than those expressly referred to at the conclusion of that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Nor was there any reference to any further documents not then available to the now Appellants but relevant to the proceedings before the Tribunal when that hearing took place in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Nor was there any application made to the Tribunal to either adjourn or postpone the hearing or to produce to the Tribunal further documents subsequent to the conclusion of that hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">19 In those circumstances, it is not possible to conclude that the now Appellant husband, when he attended the Tribunal hearing, was deprived of the opportunity to make submissions as set forth in s 425(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">That section provides as follows:
 Tribunal must invite applicant to appear (1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This right to a hearing is " clearly an important and central right " in the review system established by Part 7 of the Migration Act : Liu v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1362 at [44] , [2001] FCA 1362 ; 113 FCR 541 at 552; Amankwah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1162 at [13] , [1999] FCA 1162 ; 91 FCR 248 at 251.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The invitation to attend an oral hearing " must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture ": Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 at [31] , [2000] FCA 1759 ; 183 ALR 188 at 194---5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The obligation imposed upon the Tribunal is an obligation to give a " real and meaningful invitation to comment ": SZJBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1592 at [53] , [2007] FCA 1592 ; 164 FCR 14 at 27---8 per Allsop J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">20 Albeit not raised by any of the Grounds of Appeal , Counsel for the Respondent Minister quite properly did not oppose exploring the question as to whether there had been a breach of s 425 by reason of the Appellant not having the opportunity to place further documents or further information before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">However, it was contended by the Minister that, in the absence of any basis upon which it could be concluded that the Tribunal was on notice that potentially there may have been further information or documents relevant to its consideration (but not then available to the now First Appellant at that hearing), it is difficult to conclude that the obligation in s 425 to afford an opportunity has been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Tribunal in discharging its function is engaged in an " inquisitorial process " -- but there must nevertheless remains a reason or a basis upon which it can be said that it should inquire beyond that factual material placed before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In SZJBA Allsop J thus observed:
 [53] ... the obligation of the Tribunal to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment carried with it the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation, where not to take such steps would undermine or subvert the meaningfulness or the reality of the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That obligation involves such mundane things as opening letters, reading them once opened and taking at least basic simple steps that would be taken in any well-run commercial, professional or governmental office, conformable with the recognition of the importance of the response to the invitation to the rights of the applicant and the review process contained within Pt 7 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This does not rest on some posited duty of inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It is not engaging in steps that require for their enforcement some express statutory power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">... ... [57] These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process ... [58] This inquisitorial function has become relevant in a number of contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In Applicant S 217 CLR 387 at [76] McHugh J said: If the Tribunal had considered the issue that it was legally required to consider, it was open to the Tribunal to investigate whether such a perception existed, whether within the Afghan society or some section of it, or objectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Indeed, arguably in the context of its inquisitorial process, the Tribunal had a duty to seek evidence concerning this vital matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Where there is material which on its face suggests that the Tribunal is not in receipt of all materials, the Tribunal should normally " take simple administrative steps to address the issue ": SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 at [63] per Middleton J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">21 The opportunity " to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments " is ultimately an opportunity which places a primary responsibility upon those appearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is not the task of the Tribunal to ensure that that opportunity is utilised by those appearing to their best advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This is not to say that circumstances may not arise during the course of a Tribunal hearing which imposes an obligation upon the Tribunal to pursue particular issues further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">But, in the absence of such circumstances, it must normally remain a matter for those appearing before the Tribunal to inform the Tribunal of the evidence they wish to rely upon and to present their own arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Circumstances may also emerge that make it apparent that a hearing before the Tribunal is not a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Section 425(1) thus may not be satisfied merely because a time and place has been set aside for a hearing and a hearing member is present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">22 But such circumstances are not the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Notwithstanding the fact that the hearing before the Tribunal took a comparatively short period of time, there is nothing to indicate that the Appellants were denied an opportunity to place before the Tribunal all such materials as they then considered relevant and nothing arose during the hearing to impose upon the Tribunal any duty to make further inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">23 No breach of s 425 has been discerned, nor is there any basis for concluding that the Appellants should be given a further hearing to present such further information or documents as they may now wish to rely upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They have already been given the hearing which the legislation envisages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The fact that a party appearing before the Tribunal may subsequently consider that his case may have been better advanced had further or additional documents been placed before the Tribunal is not to deny the effectiveness of the hearing already extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Indeed, to conclude otherwise may well only encourage an administrative process whereby a party could sequentially produce further or more documents over the course of a series of hearings until he ultimately prevails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">And such a sequential process of producing further documents would be but one means of a party being impermissibly informed as to whether he had already persuaded a Tribunal as to the merits of his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Such a course is not that envisaged by s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">24 There is no basis upon which it can be concluded that the Tribunal was biased in the manner in which it proceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">25 No appellable error has been exposed by the reasons provided by the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">SECTION 424A 
 
26 Section 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides as follows: 
 Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must: (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review... ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Compliance with s 424A is mandatory: SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 , 228 CLR 294 ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [13] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 614 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 This Ground of Appeal (without alteration) relevantly contends that the " RRT breached of section 424A as the adverse information found in the hearing and in the RRT decision was not put to me in writing before the RRT is made a decision ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">28 The difficulty confronting the Appellants is the fact that the " adverse information " alleged is not further identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Nor has any breach of s 424A otherwise been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Attempts during the course of the hearing of the appeal to shed light upon what was intended by the present contention proved unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Appellants were unable to explain what was intended to be conveyed by their reliance upon s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The ground was apparently inserted upon the suggestion of a migration agent who had attended a Church service one Sunday and who proffered his " assistance ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Such " advice ", it is considered, is neither of " assistance " to the Appellants or this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">29 Moreover, there was no reliance placed upon any asserted breach of s 424A before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Leave is thus required to raise it as a ground on appeal to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">There is no explanation as to why the ground was not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and it is considered that the ground is also without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">30 Leave to now place reliance upon an asserted breach of s 424A is thus refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">COSTS 
 
31 At the conclusion of the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent Minister filed an Affidavit in support of an application that a fixed sum costs order be made in favour of the Minister in the event that the appeal was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Fixed costs were sought in the sum of $3,403.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">There is no reason not to make such an order and no reason to question the quantification of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">ORDERS 
 
32 The orders of the Court are:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The appeal be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Appellants to pay the costs of the First Respondent fixed in the sum of $3,403.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Associate:
