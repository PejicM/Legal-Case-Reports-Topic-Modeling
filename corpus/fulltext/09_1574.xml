<sentences>
<sentence id="s0">
 The applicant is an inspector appointed pursuant to s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the "BCII Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The first respondent was an officer and/or employee and/or duly authorized agent of the third respondent acting in the capacity of organizer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In the application the applicant appears to have misspelt the first respondent's surname name as "Nisbet".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The correct spelling "Nesbit" is reflected in the respondent's amended defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I give the applicant leave to amend the application to correct this error and direct it accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The third respondent is an industrial association for the purposes of the BCII Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The second respondent was dismissed from the proceedings prior to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant seeks declaratory relief and the imposition of pecuniary penalties upon the first and third respondents in connection with conduct which allegedly occurred on 23 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The parties have filed an agreed statement of facts concerning this matter which I attach to these reasons as Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Section 44 of the BCII Act provides: 
 
 (1) A person must not: 
 

 
 
 (a) take or threaten to take any action; or 
 

 
 
 (b) refrain or threaten to refrain from taking any action; 
 

 
 
 with intent to coerce another person, or with intent to apply undue pressure to another person, to agree, or not to agree: 
 

 
 
 (c) to make, vary or terminate, or extend the nominal expiry date of, a building enterprise agreement; or 
 

 
 
 (d) to approve any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 

 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to action that is protected industrial action (as affected by Part 3 of Chapter 5 of this Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 

 
 
 (3) An employer must not coerce, or attempt to coerce, an employee of the employer in relation to who is to be, or is not to be, the employee's bargaining representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 

 
 
 (4) An employer must not apply, or attempt to apply, undue pressure to an employee of the employer in relation to who is to be, or is not to be, the employee's bargaining representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 

 
 
 (5) To the extent that section 343 of the FW Act relates to: 
 

 
 
 (a) the making, varying or terminating of an enterprise agreement; or 
 

 
 
 (b) the appointment, or termination of appointment, of a bargaining representative for an enterprise agreement; 
 

 
 
 that section does not apply if the agreement is a building enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 

 I do not understand the respondents to oppose the making of an appropriate declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I am informed that the maximum penalty in the case of the first respondent is $22,000 and in the case of the third respondent, $110,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicant submits that taking all factors into account the appropriate penalty for each of the first and third respondents is "in the vicinity of the upper end of the mid-range of potential penalties".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The respondents submit that in the case of the first respondent the appropriate penalty is in the range $8,000-$10,000 and in the case of the third respondent, $15,000-$20,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The first respondent was employed as an organizer from 7 June 1999 until 24 February 2009, during which period he was responsible for a number of industries including the shop fitting industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He had been responsible for that industry since about 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The affidavit by Mr Close filed on 7 August 2009 discloses that shortly after the visit on 23 June 2008 referred to in the statement of facts, he was informed that there had been an "incident".</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Close was informed that: 
 
 There was a nasty argument that took place between Tim and Stan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">His daughter was involved in the argument and there was a fair bit of foul language used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In addition to this there is a long lists of safety concerns at the factory that were noted and advised to Stan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 

 Subsequently Mr Close learnt that the Australian Building Construction Commission (the "ABCC") was investigating the incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">As a result, he attended with the first respondent at Budget Shopfitters' premises in order to see if the matter could be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">At one stage Mr Lewis told Mr Close that matters had become "quite ugly" and that both parties were "quite aggressive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Certain safety issues were discussed, and there was then an inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Close considered that many of the safety matters about which concerns had previously been raised had been remedied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The meeting on that day ended amicably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I proceed upon the basis that when Mr Close became aware that the incident was being investigated, he took steps to resolve any continuing difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I also proceed upon the basis that although there may have been some safety issues requiring attention, the relevant threats were substantially motivated by broader industrial considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The first respondent's threats involved threatened abuse of power in order to cause ongoing disruption to Budget Shopfitters' business undertaking through industrial action, and to compel the expenditure of substantial amounts of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The first respondent's refusal to provide a list of the alleged safety issues suggests that much of his conduct was not motivated by concerns about those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Similarly, his assertion that he would "find something" was an assertion of an intention to abuse his position and the power of his union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The matter is curious in that it is unclear why the first respondent should have chosen to behave in this way on this particular occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mr Close thought it to be quite out of character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">One infers from some of the things which were said that his attitude may have been partly the product of what might be described as the "cultural war" associated with the industrial policy of the previous federal government and the changes which have been made under the present government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Of course I make no comment as to the correctness or appropriateness of either approach to industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The first respondent has no record of previous contraventions of the Act or the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the "WR Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In those circumstances he may be treated upon the basis that this incident was a one-off lapse, to some extent out of character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However the conduct was quite extreme and completely unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Court must demonstrate its disapproval of that conduct by fixing a penalty which will operate as a deterrent to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">There is no real suggestion that the first respondent expressed any remorse for his conduct at the time, although he has participated in the resolution of the matter and must be given credit for that, particularly for the fact that it has resulted in the avoidance of the need for a lengthy trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The first respondent has left the third respondent's employ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It seems that he is no longer involved in the industrial relations field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Given that there was no previous misconduct of this kind, and that the relevant incident occurred on one discrete occasion, I am inclined to think that a penalty in excess of half of the maximum would be difficult to justify, even having regard to the seriousness of this particular conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The respondents suggest a range of $8,000-$10,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I fix the penalty at $9,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">As to the third respondent, a great deal of attention has been paid by the applicant to previous occasions on which unlawful conduct has been demonstrated, going back to 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Whilst such a record is no doubt relevant, two points must be kept in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">First, many of the earlier events related to actions in other states.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The union seems to operate through a series of semi-autonomous state organizations across the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It may be that the record of one state branch is better than that of another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This fact may be relevant to the weight attributable to prior misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Similar considerations might be taken into account in considering the previous misconduct of an employer corporation which operates through semi-autonomous branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The second consideration is that any organization will, over a period of time, acquire a history, good or bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The dynamics within a particular organization, which may produce misconduct at one point in time, may not be present at some other time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">One should be cautious about inferring that a long history of misconduct, going back over many years, necessarily reflects the current mindset of the organization.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Nonetheless the third respondent has a history of infringement of industrial legislation, including some infringements in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">On the other hand, in this case, the conduct for which it is responsible, namely that of the first respondent, seems to have been out of character for him, and therefore not reasonably predictable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However as an employer itself, it was for the third respondent to ensure that clear guidelines were provided to its officers and reinforced so as to ensure that such behaviour did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The third respondent cannot be treated as being innocent of previous infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The seriousness of the allegations cannot be overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Further, when dealing with corporate employers or unions it is generally the case that only a substantial financial penalty is likely to have any deterrent effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Loss will generally be borne by a relatively large number of people, so that perhaps none will actually feel any part of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However it is also clear that the third respondent took steps to remedy the situation and has also cooperated in bringing the matter to a speedy and relatively economical conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In the circumstances I consider that a penalty roughly equivalent to that imposed upon the first respondent, but reflecting the difference in maximum penalties, is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I fix the penalty at $40,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I have been referred to the penalties imposed in numerous cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">However many were pursuant to the WR Act which provided for significantly lower maximum penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The penalties which I have imposed are generally consistent with those imposed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The conduct in that case was somewhat more serious than in this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">However the penalties for individual breaches were reduced to reflect the overall extent of the misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I will make declarations in terms of paras 48 and 49 of the applicant's submissions as follows: 
 
 Upon the admissions which the respondents made in the amended defence filed on 7 July 2009 and agreed statement of facts filed on 29 July 2009, it is declared that: 
 

 
 
 (a) On 23 June 2008, [the first respondent] contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by asking an employer to:
 (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and 
 

 
 
 (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; 
 

 
 
 (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: 
 

 
 
 (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and 
 

 
 
 (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, 
 

 
 
 in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

 
 
 (b) On 23 June 2008, the CFMEU contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by virtue of the conduct of its officer, Tim Nesbit, in asking an employer to: 
 

 
 
 (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and 
 

 
 
 (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; 
 

 
 
 (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: 
 

 
 
 (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and 
 

 
 
 (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, 
 

 
 
 in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 

 I order that the first respondent pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty fixed at $9,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I further order that the third respondent pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty fixed at $40,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.</sentence>
