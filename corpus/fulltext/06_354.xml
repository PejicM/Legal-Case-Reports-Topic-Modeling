1 On the seventy-first day of the trial, the applicants served a notice to produce on the Telstra respondents, seeking production of:
 
 ' Unmasked copies of all discovered documents which are masked, wholly or in part, for relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">' 

Telstra has now applied to set aside the notice to produce on the ground that it seeks the production of documents of no apparent relevance to the issues in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 23 October 2003, I made orders establishing an elaborate protocol for discovery of documents by the many parties to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The orders provide for the exchange of electronic indexes and images of discovered documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The orders clearly contemplate that the parties may 'redact' those portions of 'partially relevant' documents that are irrelevant to any issue in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 In practice, the parties have provided electronic copies of documents which effectively black out or omit those portions considered to contain irrelevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I was informed from the bar table that Telstra has masked 697 documents as partially irrelevant, while the applicants have masked 1,879 documents for the same reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Mr Sheahan SC, on behalf of the applicants, recognises that masking for irrelevance is specifically contemplated by the discovery orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He also recognises that, while an unqualified order for discovery may require a party to produce unmasked copies of all partially relevant documents unless the Court grants relief from the requirement, it was appropriate for Telstra in the present case to mask the truly irrelevant portions of discovered documents: cf Gray v Associated Book Publishers (Aust) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1045 , at [9], [14]-[15], per Branson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 , at [12]-[13], per Selway J; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 , at [16] ff, per Sundberg J, and authorities cited there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">5 Mr Sheahan says, however, that Telstra has frequently masked not only irrelevant material, but material that is directly relevant to issues in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He submits that the only way the applicants can be protected against the risk that they have been denied access to relevant material is by an order requiring Telstra to make available the entirety of all documents masked for relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He points out that the 'unmasking' should not be a complicated process, having regard to the fact that production of documents has been effected electronically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Sheahan also points out that any issue of confidentiality can be addressed by limiting access to the unmasked documents, at least initially, to the legal representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 In support of the applicants' contentions, Mr Sheahan gives fifteen examples of documents which he says have been either inappropriately masked by Telstra or in respect of which there are grounds for suspicion that relevant material has been inappropriately masked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Several of these examples concern documents that have been masked as irrelevant, but the masked portions of which have subsequently been annexed to statements of witnesses called by Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In several other instances, Telstra has provided unmasked copies of documents to the applicants following complaints by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the remaining cases, Mr Sheahan argues that the documents themselves provide on their face a basis for suspicion that the masked material might indeed be relevant to the issues in the proceedings, or that it might at least be helpful in establishing the context for relevant information disclosed by Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 In assessing the significance of the applicants' complaints, it must be remembered that this is an exceedingly large and very complex case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Scores of thousands of documents have been discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The task of masking documents for relevance, as the orders to which I have referred contemplate, cannot be easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Exercising a judgment as to whether or not material is relevant to the issues in the proceedings is not a purely mechanical matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It is inevitable, with maximum goodwill and diligence, that errors will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Since I assume that the applicants would have brought to my attention virtually all the cases of inappropriate, or possibly inappropriate, masking of which they are aware, I would regard the fifteen examples they identify as demonstrating a relatively low error rate on the part of Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Certainly I would not be prepared to conclude that there has been any deliberate attempt by Telstra to mask material that is known to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">8 In my view, the remedy sought by the applicants is disproportionate to any problem that they may have identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It appears that any complaint made in the past about apparently inappropriate masking has been addressed by Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">If particular documents on their face give rise to a suspicion that segments may have been inappropriately masked, I would be prepared to entertain an application seeking an unmasked version of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Indeed, as I commented to Mr Sheahan in argument, if it seems that the masked portion of a document might be helpful in providing context for unmasked material, there may well be grounds for treating such an application sympathetically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">But to require Telstra to unmask all material masked for relevance would undo the protocol that the parties have chosen to adopt and to which they have adhered throughout the proceedings, including the first seventy days of hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 I should add that the applicants have known of a number of the matters about which they complain for a considerable period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">No application was made for access to the masked material prior to the commencement of the hearing or indeed before the witnesses called by Telstra had substantially completed their evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">To require Telstra to unmask all documents masked for relevance creates a real danger of disruption to the trial, as the applicants consider the significance of the unmasked material and perhaps seek to put fresh material to witnesses who have already given evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">(I do not imply by this concern that any such material would necessarily be relevant to the issues in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">)
 
10 In my view, the notice to produce issued by the applicants to the Telstra respondents should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">If the applicants wish to apply to gain access to the masked portions of particular documents, I shall consider their application.</sentence>
