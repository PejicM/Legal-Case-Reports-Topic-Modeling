1 This is an appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 20 April 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 13 October 2005 and handed down 8 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who arrived in Australia on 30 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 5 May 2005 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A delegate of the Minister refused the application for a protection visa on 14 July 2005 and notified the appellant of the decision and his review rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 15 August 2005 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The appellant attended a hearing at the Tribunal on 13 October 2005 and gave oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">CLAIMS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 
 
3 In his application for a protection visa, the appellant stated that he was born in Hebei, China in 1970, and that he was self employed before coming to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He said that he was married in 1994 in Hebei, and that his wife and son reside in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Tribunal noted that the appellant appeared to have travelled to Australia using a passport in his own name, which was issued in Hebei in February 2003, expiring in 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant further indicated that he had lived at the same address in Hebei from March 1970 until April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant stated that he worked as a process worker from 1986 until 1988, and that he was then self-employed as a farmer from 1988 until 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant claimed that he left China because he was a Falun Gong member and the head of his village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 The appellant claimed that he became a member of Falun Gong in 1998 and that in 1999, he went to Beijing to participate in Falun Gong activities and to ask for "legal status" for Falun Gong practitioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant further claimed that in 2000, a "team from the Chinese Communist party came to my home; they investigated me and tried to find some evidence against me".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant further claimed that he was taken to the local Security Bureau and "suffered mental and physical persecution from the police" although no evidence was found against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant then claimed that he was beaten, insulted and eventually released after a few days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He claimed that he did not change his belief and that in 2005 the police again investigated him, as that was he felt that he could not "get away from this", he came to Australia for protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 In his oral evidence before the Tribunal on 13 October 2005, the appellant stated that his application for a protection visa was prepared with the help of a friend in Australia who was not a migration agent, but had experience in immigration matters, and that he gave this person his details and information and the person wrote such information in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The appellant claimed that this person "roughly" read the information back to him in his own language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellant identified his own signature on the application for protection visa form, stating that as far as he was aware, the details in the application form were true and correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 The appellant wrote down the address of the place he had lived prior to coming to Australia, stating that he had lived there his entire life and that his wife and child are still living there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He also stated that he had worked at the same place in his own animal feed wholesale business for 3 to 5 years prior to coming to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">When asked by the Tribunal as to why he left China in 2005, the appellant stated that he did so because he was persecuted and harassed often by police, and that he was arrested in 2000 because of his practice of Falun Gong and because he went to Beijing to protest in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The appellant further stated that he had practised Falun Gong since 1998, as he was told that it would improve his health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 When asked by the Tribunal how he practised Falun Gong, the appellant stated that he practised with others, and sometimes practised at home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He further alleged that he only occasionally did the exercises, because he was too busy with his business, but that he watched Falun Gong videos and read Falun books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The appellant was unable to describe the five main exercises to the Tribunal, stating that he had not practised them for years, further stating that he had not practised since 2000 because "they were very strict and I did not practise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">" When asked if he knew the Falun Gong symbol, the appellant drew a sketch of it, and agreed that it was incomplete, stating that "I can't recall the symbol exactly as I haven't had anything to do with it for a long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">" When the Tribunal then asked why he was investigated in 2005, the appellant stated that he was arrested in 2000 and "they became interested in me again in 2005" due to the records on file about him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appellant further stated that he had "rarely" practised Falun Gong in Australia, because he was busy with work, later agreeing with the Tribunal that he had not practised Falun Gong whilst he had been in Australia, because he had not had any time, due to work commitments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">8 The Tribunal told the appellant that it had difficulty accepting his claims that he was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, as he was able to tell the Tribunal only a very little about Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal informed the appellant that it had difficulty accepting as true his evidence that the authorities became interested in him in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">9 The appellant then told the Tribunal that his home was searched by authorities in 2000 and that he was detained at the local police station in his hometown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He agreed with the Tribunal that he did not have any trouble getting his passport issued in his hometown in 2003, and had no trouble from authorities exiting China, but said that if he returned to China, he feared that he would have the same trouble from authorities that he had in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">When asked why he lived and worked in China until 2005, the appellant stated that the authorities only became interested in him in 2005, due to his Falun Gong books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal told the appellant that it did not accept that he was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner and that it did not accept as true his evidence about what happened to him in China in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The appellant responded that many people were arrested in China simply for having Falun Gong books and that his evidence was true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
10 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner, or that he was involved in Falun Gong activities in China as he claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As a result the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was investigated, detained or ill-treated as he claimed either in 2000, in 2005, or at any time because of his Falun Gong activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant left the PRC for the reasons he claimed, and further did not accept that the appellant cannot or will not returned to the PRC, due to fear of persecution in the PRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Tribunal commented that the reason that the Tribunal found against the appellant in relation to these matters, was because the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">11 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, in either China or Australia, commenting that if he were a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, he would have been able to tell the Tribunal more about Falun Gong, as well as describe or name the Falun Gong exercises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">When the Tribunal asked the appellant about the Falun Gong exercises, he was not able to do this, stating that this was because he had not practised Falun Gong for a long time, because he was not able to practise Falun Gong in China, as he was both busy and the authorities were "very strict" in their opposition to the practise of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Tribunal did not accept this explanation as true and further did not accept that the appellant did not practise Falun Gong in China, due to opposition from authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal found that if the appellant had practised Falun Gong in China between 1998 and 2000 as he claimed, he would have been able to tell the Tribunal more about Falun Gong, and that he would have generally been able to explain the Falun Gong exercises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal further found that if the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, he would have resumed his practise of Falun Gong in Australia, despite being busy with work, noting that the appellant agreed that he had not done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">12 The Tribunal further noted that if the appellant was of interest to the Chinese authorities and persecuted for Falun Gong activities, he would not have been able to work in his business, that he told the Tribunal that he had been working for three to five years prior to coming to Australia, and that he had lived at his usual family home, where he further stated that he had lived his entire life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The appellant's explanation for this was that he was able to do this, because the authorities only became interested in him again in 2005, as a lot of books and CD's about Falun Gong were becoming available on sale at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal did not accept this explanation as plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 The Tribunal found there was no plausible evidence before it that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner, and that he would suffer persecution from authorities in China either now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, for Falun Gong activities if he returns to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal was not satisfied on the evidence before it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution in China within the meaning of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Consequently, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention, as amended by the Refugee Protocol, and affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">GROUNDS BEFORE THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
14 On 5 December 2005 the appellant sought judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The appellant raised one ground of contention in an amended application filed on 29 May 2006, which stated that the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Essentially these particulars outlined that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') and as such committed jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Quotations from two judgments were also provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The particulars were as follows: 
 
 
 "(a) The only information before the Tribunal was that contained in the First Respondent's file and that given to the Tribunal by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 (b) The Tribunal was required to provide particulars of the information that was the reason, or part of the reason for affirming the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Migration Act 1958 s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Tribunal also was required to explain why the information was relevant and providing the applicant with an opportunity to comment upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) The above particulars had to be provided in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 (d) The information to be given extends to that information given by the Applicant to the First Respondent as part of his application for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 (e) The Tribunal based it's findings on the information, or lack of information, contained in the Applicant's application for a visa and was required, by s 424A , to give particulars of the information, explain why the information is relevant and provide the Applicant with an opportunity to comment upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Tribunal's failure to so act was a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">" 
 
 

15 At the hearing the appellant outlined that he did not feel the Tribunal had considered his case properly because it was biased against him and that the Tribunal did not understand his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
16 The Federal Magistrate declined to find the existence of bias without full particularisation and some evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">17 The allegation that the Tribunal had failed to understand his application was as the Federal Magistrate noted, not particularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">His Honour held that it was for the applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that he was a person to whom Australia owes protection obligations: Applicant S214/2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 166 [26]---[28]; Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; [2003] 197 ALR 389 [78] per Kirby J; Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; [1999] 197 CLR 510 at [187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">18 His Honour rejected the submission that the Tribunal had decided his case according to assumptions rather than evidence, finding that the appellant was in effect alleging that the Tribunal had not produced its own evidence to contradict that put up by the applicant, which it was not the Tribunal's duty to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">19 The appellant then argued before the Federal Magistrate that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A because it did not write to him before the decision was handed down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Federal Magistrate apprehended that the appellant was in effect saying that he was entitled to be provided with some form of draft reasons which he could then argue against before the Tribunal made a final decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">His Honour held that there was no requirement for this to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Federal Magistrate reiterated that it was for the applicant to satisfy the Tribunal as to his claims, and that it was clear that he had had an opportunity to convince the Tribunal that his claims were genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 The appellant's submission that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by using irrelevant evidence which was out of date was rejected by the Federal Magistrate, as the Tribunal had not relied upon any independent country information but had decided the application purely based on the credibility of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal did not make any jurisdictional error, in the matter in which it made its decision in this particular case, and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 
21 The Notice of Appeal filed by the appellant on 8 May 2007 was accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The Notice of Appeal contains three ground of appeal outlined as follows:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Tribunal had bias against me and did not consider my application according to S91R of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Tribunal did not believe that I am a member of Falun Gong based on assumption, not evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The Tribunal failed to notify me the reason or part of the reasons for affirming the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Tribunal did not consider my application in accordance with S424A of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 

22 An affidavit was also submitted by the appellant, which stated as follows: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Tribunal had bias against me and did not consider my application according to S91R of the migration Act 1958.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Tribunal did not believe that I am a genuine Falun Gong member based on assumption, not evidence 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Tribunal failed to consider my application in accordance with S424A of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I was not notified in writing the reason or part of the reasons for affirming the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Tribunal failed to consider my claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 
 REASONS 
 First ground of appeal 
 
23 An allegation of bias must be distinctly made and clearly proved: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The appellant has provided no particulars nor pointed to any evidence to support this serious allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The record of the Tribunal's decision discloses nothing which would suggest the existence of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">24 As to the alleged failure to consider the appellant's application in accordance with s 91R of the Act, again no particulars have been provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">If it be that this aspect of the first ground relates to a failure to consider whether the appellant fell within the criteria in subsections 91R(1) or (2) of the Act, then in my opinion it fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal considered and addressed each of the matters raised by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Furthermore, any challenge to the conclusion reached by the Tribunal is, in effect, to seek an impermissible review of the merits of the decision: NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 ; Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 420.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It cannot properly be asserted that there was no evidence upon which the Tribunal's decision was based: WAJS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 139 at [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">25 If it be that this aspect of the first ground asserts a breach of s 91R(3) of the Act because the Tribunal took into account the failure of the appellant to practise Falun Gong after his arrival in Australia, then this too fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Section 91R(3) of the Act has application only where an applicant seeks to rely on conduct in Australia in support of a claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution: SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] - [31] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">That is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Ultimately the applicant told the Tribunal that he had not practised Falun Gong in Australia and the Tribunal so found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Second ground of appeal 
 
26 Again, no particulars have been provided in relation to the appellant's second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The assumptions upon which the Tribunal is alleged to have based its decision are not identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">27 In any event I see nothing in the findings and reasons of the Tribunal to suggest that the Tribunal based its findings on any assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The reasons of the Tribunal for its decision disclose that its findings were based on the evidence provided by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">If this ground of appeal is taken to be an allegation that the Tribunal failed to investigate any matter or gather evidence, there was of course no obligation upon the Tribunal to do so: WAGJ of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [25] ; Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [34] , affirmed in Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 166 at [26] ; S1194/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1133 at [13] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">28 Accordingly this ground must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Third ground of appeal 
 
29 Once again no particulars have been provided in relation to the third ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">No particular information is identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">At the hearing before me the appellant added that the Tribunal had taken irrelevant information into account but could not, when I asked him, identify what this information was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He was also not able to identify what information should have been given to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He said that his submissions, which he read out at the hearing of the appeal, had been prepared by a Chinese friend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">30 The information relied on by the Tribunal for its decision was the appellant's oral evidence which was supplied by him for the purposes of the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">It falls within the exception under s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There was accordingly no obligation upon the Tribunal under s 424A in relation to that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">31 Finally the appellant has provided no particulars to support his assertion that the Tribunal failed to consider his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I am unable to discern ay such error from a consideration of the Tribunal's reasons and its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This ground also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">CONCLUSION 
 
32 The appellant has not demonstrated any jurisdictional error going to the decision of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
