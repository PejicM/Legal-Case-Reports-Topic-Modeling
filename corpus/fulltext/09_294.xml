<sentence id="s0">
 Application has been made by Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) for the winding up of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In that winding-up application, there has been brought today an application for the appointment of provisional liquidators to that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Messrs Rajendra Kumar Khatri and Ivor Worrell, each of whom is an official liquidator, have consented to such an appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Those gentlemen are presently the administrators of Storm Financial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr Khatri has filed a very candid and detailed affidavit in respect of the present position of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">From that it emerges that there are presently no directors of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The last of the directors, a Mrs Cassimatis, tendered her resignation on 27 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In so doing, she left the company Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group without any board at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group is a subsidiary of Storm Financial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Storm Financial, aside from being subject to administration under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act), is the subject of an appointment of receivers and managers at the behest of the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The receivers and managers have appropriately been served with the provisional liquidation application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They have appeared today to confirm a position which they had adopted in correspondence as between their solicitors and those of the administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That position is, firstly and formally, that the receivers and managers neither consent to nor oppose the appointment of provisional liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group is presently the subject of a complaint notice, arising from its operations, issued by the Financial Planning Association of Australia Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">That complaint notice is materially grounded in the adequacy or otherwise of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group's professional conduct in the provision of financial planning advice to an individual named in annexure A to the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It may well be that that particular complaint comes to manifest itself in another way in the form of a claim against Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group for loss said to arise from inadequate financial advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">At the moment, the position is, as Mr Khatri deposes, that the company has some $300,000 in a bank account and known liabilities in the order of $20,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The position further is that the company does not seem to be trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The ground upon which the winding up itself of the company is sought is that specified in s 461(1)(k) of the Corporations Act , namely the just and equitable ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">My attention has helpfully been drawn to a decision of Barrett J in CIC Insurance Limited v Hannan and Co Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 437 ; (2001) 38 ACSR 245 ( CIC Insurance case).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">At para 10 his Honour notes that there are statements in the cases which call into question the propriety of actions which caused the number of directors of the company to be reduced below the statutory minimum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">One might, having regard to those sentiments, call into question, on the basis of such authorities, the propriety of the resignation of the last of the directors of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That said, though, in the ordinary course of events, it would be possible for the shareholders of a company to remove directors and to replace them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Further, as Cohen J observed in Corpique (Number 20) Proprietary Limited v Eastcourt Limited (1999) 15 ACLR 586 , it would not be a proper exercise of a company's powers, either under statute or under its constitution, to pass resolutions removing directors and not replacing them such that the minimum number required by law was not maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In CIC Insurance , at para 11, Barrett J opined that: 
 It may be doubted whether these concerns are well-founded, at least insofar as they relate to removal of directors by members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It is not as if disappearance of the whole board leaves the company without the means to continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There is a residual common law power for the members, in general meeting, to appoint directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 His Honour later observes, at para 12, that directors are enjoined during times of economic difficulty in the company to take particular care in the incurring of debts by the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">His Honour cites authority for that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">His Honour further notes that such circumstances will generally prompt diligent directors towards the voluntary administration regime in Pt 5.3A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It is evident from the correspondence exhibited to Mr Khatri's affidavit that there has been what one might term a degree of prompting as to the taking of that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It is also evident that that prompting has not been heeded, for whatever reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In the CIC Insurance case, at para 13, Barrett J voiced the opinion that: 
 The fact that directors are unable or unwilling to act, so that there is a power vacuum level, is probably not, of itself, sufficient to justify winding up on the just and equitable ground, since it always open to members to appoint directors who can function as a board: Morgan v 45 Flers Avenue Proprietary Limited (1986) 10 ACLR 692.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">There must be some additional element of corporate paralysis, such as the absence of any prospect of the company continuing to operate: Re Vision Image (Aust) Pty Ltd; Cheng v Yeo (1998) WASC 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 In this case, of course, I am not concerned with the winding up itself, but rather with the appointment of provisional liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Nonetheless, it seems to me that the sentiments voiced by Barrett J at para 13 are pertinent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">There is, in my opinion, established on the evidence, a corporate paralysis, and, further, having regard to the subjection of the shares in the company to the charge, every prospect manifested by the present stance of the receivers and managers that the company's shareholder will not be able to alleviate the present power vacuum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It is desirable, having regard to the real prospect, as I assess it, on Mr Khatri's affidavit, of claims against the company and the fact that there is a substantial amount of money in the company's bank account, that the company be under some form of lawful control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The prospective provisional liquidators have, by Mr Khatri's affidavit, frankly disclosed the existence of loans as between Storm Financial and Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Mr Khatri deposes in these terms: 
 The only potential source of conflict that I am able to identify for this court is in relation to the status of the loan account between the company and the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I do not, however, believe that any conflict in fact arises because: 

 
 (a) the receivers and managers have control of the plaintiff's loan account; and
 (b) the balance of the loan account has been calculated by the independent chief financial officer of both companies, and no uncertainty or dispute exists regarding the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 I expressly take that into account and share the view voiced by Mr Khatri that, at present, the existence of that loan account is not a source of conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Of course, if the position changes, then doubtless there may be a need to review the appropriateness of Mr Khatri and Mr Worrell continuing in their capacity as provisional liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I should expect them, given their position as court-appointed provisional liquidators and, as well, experienced practitioners in the field, to raise that of their own motion, in any event, should there be an apprehension as to conflict which did manifest itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In short, then, it seems to me that the case is one in which it is appropriate to order the appointment of provisional liquidators to this company so as to ensure that it is subject to lawful control in its affairs pending the hearing and determination of the winding-up application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">A question remains as to whether or not, as would ordinarily be the case in respect of the appointment of provisional liquidators, an undertaking as to damages ought be sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">This is a quite exceptional circumstance wherein the company is a wholly owned subsidiary and, at least for the present, appears to be in a solvent situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It is quite different to other cases, perhaps the ordinary run of cases, where provisional liquidators are appointed at the behest of a creditor who has made a winding-up application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I therefore do not propose to require the provision of an undertaking in respect of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I make orders for the appointment of Messrs Khatri and Worrell as provisional liquidators of the company in terms of the draft provided to me, which I initial and place with the court papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Associate:
