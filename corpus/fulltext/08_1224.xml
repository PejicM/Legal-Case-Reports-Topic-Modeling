1 This case is unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The respondent, Tristar Steering and Suspension Australia Limited (Tristar), is accused of contravening a section of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the Act) that is designed, so far as is relevant to this case, to protect freedom of association, because it victimised or discriminated against employees by not dismissing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">FACTS 
 
2 The critical facts can be gleaned from the agreed chronology, a copy of which, with some editing, is attached as a schedule to this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The part of the redundancy provision of the 2003 Certified Agreement which is at the centre of the applicant's case, is as follows:
 "21.5 Severance Payment 
 
 Employees who are retrenched involuntarily and voluntarily will be paid on the following basis:
 
 Less than 1 year of service Nil
 1 or more years of service Rate of 4 weeks per year (including pro-rata for partially completed year)
 computed from the commencement of employment
 In the event of a voluntary redundancy, the maximum severance payment shall be capped at 52 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">"
 
 

That, of course, is only one clause of a comprehensive collective agreement and cannot be read in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">However, on any view, its provisions were remarkably generous, particularly to long-serving employees who are involuntarily retrenched.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The gist of the applicant's case, although spelled out in different ways, is that there was a substantial surplus of employees of Tristar once manufacturing effectively ceased in 2006 and that Tristar thereafter managed the shedding of that surplus labour so as to minimise the obligation to pay severance pay through compulsory redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In particular, the nominated employees were retained without any meaningful work to do with a view to the expiration of the Certified Agreement before their dismissal, because they were long serving employees who would be entitled to a considerable severance payment if made redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The gist of Tristar's case is that the shedding of labour was done in accordance with the Certified Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The employees in question were retained because their skill and experience was suited to the work of remanufacturing and to work which might arise from the overseas joint ventures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The purpose of avoiding large redundancy payments was denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 I am satisfied that the efforts by Tristar to obtain remanufacturing work, and the pursuit of the overseas joint ventures, were each genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It was reasonable to retain some labour to carry out that work if it were obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Most, if not all, of the retained employees had skill and experience that would be useful in carrying out that work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On the other hand, I am satisfied that the terms of cl 21.5 of the Certified Agreement were a factor in deciding how many employees to retain, and who they should be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Length of service was undoubtedly a significant reason for the retention of particular employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">To the extent that the evidence of the witnesses for Tristar was to the contrary, I reject it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The number of employees retained was greater than necessary to cope with the work that might have reasonably eventuated in the short to medium term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It is difficult to find an objective basis for the retention of at least some of the employees apart from length of service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The redundancies that followed the extension of the operation of the Certified Agreement point in the same direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The evidence of the Tristar decision makers was not impressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 There is no doubt that the retained employees were seriously underemployed with a number having no work to do or no work of the kind for which they were qualified and previously employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I am satisfied that most, if not all, of the retained employees found the experience disturbing and stressful and some of them suffered some lasting psychological trauma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">However, it cannot be overlooked that Tristar was a union shop, and there was an industrial campaign on foot between the unions and Tristar with political implications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The dispute as to whether the employees could be directed to undertake remanufacturing work was one aspect of that campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">That took many months to resolve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The retained employees did not work during that period by choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In one sense, they were foot soldiers who were the victims of the wider campaign being conducted by the generals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">CERTIFIED AGREEMENT 
 
6 The Certified Agreement was between Tristar, on the one hand, and four unions, on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It was certified pursuant to s 170LJ of the Act, as it stood in 2003 and 2004.</sentence>

17 I have been referred to literally dozens of cases, from the High Court of Australia down, dealing with the application of similar provisions in earlier Commonwealth legislation dating back to 1904, and State legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">These authorities need to be approached with considerable caution as few of them take into account the significant changes introduced, firstly, by the 1996 Commonwealth Act and none with the Act as it stood at the time of these events following the so-called "Work Choices" legislation in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By and large, they do not relate to situations like the present and none dealt with comparable facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Many are single judge decisions on their own facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Indeed, the existence of this body of authority can distract from the task of construing the Act as it now stands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I will only refer to those decisions that are of most relevance to this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">18 Part 16 deals with the freedom of association aspect of the principal object (s 3(j)) and, as set out above, has its own objects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The aspects of the principal object identified in s 3(d), (e) and (f) are dealt with in other Parts of the Act --- in particular, Pt 8, Pt 10, Pt 13 and Pt 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The structure of the Act in general and the objects of Pt 16, dealing with freedom of association, are quite different from those which pertained for most of the history of industrial relations in Australia post Federation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Regulation was by way of award negotiated by trade unions with employer representatives and arbitrated by an industrial tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">As Mason J said in General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 12 ALR 605 at 616 in dealing with s 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth):
 "The two subsections are, broadly speaking, designed to protect an officer, delegate or member of an organization against discrimination by his employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">They have a legislative history which extends back to the turn of the century when the trade union was a more fragile institution than it is today and when it stood in need of a large measure of protection from employers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">" 
His Honour later referred to "the protection of trade unions and their representatives from discrimination and victimization by employers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">That extended to employees who were members of the union and took advantage of union negotiated awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">19 The Act as it stood in 2006 did not contain any vestige of special protection for trade unions or the members of trade unions compared with employers, organisations of employers or, more particularly, those who do not belong to a trade union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Nonetheless, the benefits of freedom of association are afforded to those who wish to belong to trade unions as well as to those who do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">20 It will be observed that object (b) of s 778 picks up the words "discriminated against" or "victimised" that have traditionally been used in this field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">In my opinion, as the provisions now stand, taken in context, s 792 can have no sensible operation unless it involves discrimination against, or victimisation of, an employee on some basis connected with union membership, no matter how broadly.</sentence>

 PRINCIPAL CASE 
 
22 The principal basis upon which the case is put is that Tristar injured or altered the position of each of the employees to the employer's prejudice by not dismissing the particular employees, thus disentitling him or her to a severance payment in accordance with cl 21.5 of the Certified Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In my opinion, that case cannot succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The problem underlying these circumstances was the loss of business rather than any operative decision of Tristar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In 2000, 370 persons were employed and by January 2006 the number was reduced to 177.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">When major manufacturing ceased, it was obvious that there would be the need for further significant reduction in employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Clause 21 of the Certified Agreement was designed to cope with that situation, particularly cl 21.9, which dealt with the selection of redundant employees where surplus staff existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It is obvious that the purpose of the clause was to avoid unnecessary involuntary retrenchments and then to manage the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The clause makes it clear that, ultimately, it is at the employer's discretion as to which employees would be subject to compulsory redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">By August 2006 the numbers were reduced to 50 production employees and 19 staff employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">By August 2007, the production employees had been reduced to 19 and the staff positions to 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">There is no allegation in this case that Tristar breached cl 21 in any respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">23 The applicant's contention is tantamount to treating cl 21.5 as a conditional contractual benefit for an affected employee like long service leave or superannuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The unstated premise of the contention is that the employer had a duty to dismiss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">That is a misconception as to the purpose and effect of cl 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">No complaint is made in this proceeding about failure of Tristar to follow the procedures laid down by cl 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">If there had been, that could have been the subject of a dispute referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or possibly of a proceeding in this Court to compel compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">So far as this aspect of the case is concerned, Tristar simply maintained the employees in their position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The status quo remained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">That did not "do" anything to "injure" an employee or "alter the position" of an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">24 A "before and after" test is usually applied to see whether there has been any injury to, or prejudicial alteration of, the position of the employee by reason of any act of the employer (eg per Evatt J in Blair v Australian Motor Industries Ltd (1982) 61 FLR 283 at 289, 3 IR 176; per Branson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; (2007) 157 FCR 329 at [127] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Applying what had been said by the Full Court in an earlier interlocutory appeal ( BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 at [35] ), it was succinctly put by Kenny J in Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482 at [54] as follows:
 "Before s 298K(1) can apply, it must be possible to say of an employee that he or she is, individually speaking, in a worse situation after the employer's acts than before them; that the deterioration has been caused by those acts; and that the acts were intentional in the sense that the employer intended the deterioration to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">" 
The clarification of that approach by the Full Court in Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; (2001) 107 FCR 93 at [21] does not detract from it for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The same questions must be asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Here, there should be a negative answer to each limb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">25 Tracey J usefully summarised the authorities as to the former s 298K in Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 , (2006) 160 IR 1 at [13] ---[22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">"Injury" is concerned with an adverse effect upon an existing legal right, or "compensable" injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Prejudicial alteration of position goes beyond that concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">There are many examples in the cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">It is sufficient to refer to Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [37] and [38]; Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corp Ltd [2001] FCA 267 ; 107 FCR 93 at [17] ---[22]; Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union [2001] FCA 349 ; (2001) 112 FCR 232 ; and Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">26 The decision in Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 is a good illustration of where the dividing line might be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Cases on the non-contravening side of the line include Burnie Port Corp Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [2000] FCA 1768 ; (2000) 104 FCR 440 and Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; 106 FCR 482.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A case with some similarities to the present is National Union of Workers v Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; (2001) 108 FCR 90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It dealt with a situation where there was a surplus of employees for genuine business reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">A "spill and fill" selection and retrenchment process was held not to be capable of giving rise to an injury to any particular employee in his or her employment and could not be said to have altered the position of any individual employee to his or her prejudice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">(See also Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Ltd [2006] FCA 1441 , (2006) 160 IR 1 at [29] and [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">) 
 
27 If there were a duty to dismiss, to whom was it owed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The argument seems to be that Tristar owed a duty to every employee covered by the Certified Agreement to dismiss that employee during the course of 2006 when major manufacturing ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">However, manufacturing and remanufacturing work continued for some time thereafter and, as I have said, Tristar was genuine in seeking that and other business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It was entitled to retain employees to carry out that actual and potential work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Once the employer has that choice, then no individual employee could claim that there was any obligation upon Tristar to dismiss that employee in order to trigger cl 21.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">ALTERNATIVE CASE 
 
28 What, then, of the alternative case, based upon the change in duties and, in particular, the lack of productive work that was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">As I have said, I accept that many of the employees who gave evidence found the experience unpleasant and some psychological damage was done to some of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Again, the difficulty for the applicant's case is that Tristar was essentially passive so far as the particular employees are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The work available was constrained by commercial considerations --- there is no suggestion that it was contriving not to win work for some ulterior purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The decisions which it took in relation to premises, plant and equipment were the result of the commercial realities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The same can be said concerning the arrangements with the continuing employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">They were given such tasks as were available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">None of the affected employees was obliged to stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">If conditions were intolerable, then none was the subject of a long-term contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">No doubt, voluntary redundancy would have been available to most, if not all, of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">29 There is a respectable argument that an employee cannot be indefinitely denied work to do if work of an appropriate kind is available ( Blackadder v Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 22 ; (2005) 221 CLR 539 , particularly per Callinan and Heydon JJ at [80]; Squires v Flight Stewards Assn of Australia (1982) 2 IR 155 at 164; Downe v Sydney West Area Health Service (No 2) [2008] NSWSC 159 at [410] ---[431]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">No such appropriate work was available here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">30 There may be circumstances where the conduct of the employer towards an employee is such that the employee, upon leaving, can assert that he or she has been constructively dismissed, triggering whatever rights the employee may have upon dismissal ( Westen v Union des Assurances de Paris (1996) 88 IR 259 at 261; Brackenridge v Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd (1996) 142 ALR 99 at 106; in the case of position redundancy see Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; (2002) 125 FCR 9 at [27] ; cf Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corp Ltd [2007] FCAFC 35 at [19] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In the present case, that may have included a claim pursuant to cl 21.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">That case could have been pursued by or on behalf of these employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">That course was adopted in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 1613 , (2001) 111 IR 241 (although set aside in the result on appeal Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2002] FCAFC 193 ; 125 FCR 9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Rather, the choice was made here to seek to use the freedom of association provisions to, in effect, act as a means of specific enforcement of cl 21.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">31 In short, whatever the employees suffered by way of psychological distress was not caused by any act of Tristar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Rather, the choice they made to continue in employment was the operative reason for the prejudice ( Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , (2002) 113 IR 326 at [53] and [54]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In my opinion, none of these employees was injured, nor was the position of any of them prejudicially altered by any act of the employer as required by s 792.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">PROHIBITED REASON 
 
32 Even if the necessary injury or alteration of position had been established, a sole or dominant prohibited reason has not been established (s 792(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The selection of employees for retrenchment had no scintilla of connection with freedom of association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">All employees covered by the Certified Agreement had the benefit of that agreement without discrimination between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">There is no suggestion that selection for retrenchment was made for any reason associated with union membership or non-membership, or union activity or non-activity, or because these employees were covered by the Certified Agreement and other potential persons affected were covered by some other agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">There is simply no basis for suggestion of discrimination or victimisation in any relevant respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The employees the subject of this proceeding are only a proportion of the workforce as it stood in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">33 So far as s 793(1)(i) is concerned, the affected employees were, or are, entitled to the benefit of the Certified Agreement in common with all production employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">There is no discrimination between employees in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">There is no suggestion that persons with the benefit of the Certified Agreement were being discriminated against as compared with people who did not have the benefit of that Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The fact that the employer was, or may have been, advantaged by not dismissing particular employees because of the way in which cl 21.5 worked, is not pertinent to this statutory obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The content and effect of an agreement may not always be irrelevant --- for example, if the way a particular clause operates is related to some relevant form of discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The decision of the Full Court in Greater Dandenong City Council [2001] FCA 349 ; 112 FCR 232 may provide an example of that, although it is a difficult decision --- as Branson J said in CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [54] , it is not easy to derive a ratio decidendi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The decision in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2007] FCAFC 18 ; 157 FCR 329 may be another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">In each case, the employer had work to be done by those employed pursuant to an industrial instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The proposed change meant that the work would be done by those who were willing to take alternative employment pursuant to different industrial instruments or perhaps no industrial instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">That is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">34 Another instance may be provided by what was said by Street J in Hunt v Railway Commissioners (NSW); Ex parte Brown-Smith [1928] AR (NSW) 151 at 154 (albeit dealing with a differently framed section):
 "and the dismissal must, I think, be a dismissal by an employer really as a matter of victimisation, or the capricious use of his power to dismiss in order, to retaliate upon the employee for his having dared to assert a claim to rights under the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">" 
In dealing with that section, Evatt J in Grayndler v Cunich [1939] HCA 32 ; (1939) 62 CLR 573 said at 595:
 "we are not investigating a case where a business or department is being closed down, but a case where an employer has determined (1) that the enterprise as a whole shall be conducted entirely upon conditions of private bargaining which are less favourable to employees than award conditions, and also (2) that every employee who qualifies himself to obtain the better award conditions shall immediately be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">This is one of the obvious cases which sec.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">9 was designed to cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">" 
This case is not analogous to those examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">35 Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127).</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Examples include Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; 108 FCR 90 at [119] ---[126]; Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 , particularly at [66]---[67]; CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326, particularly at [55]---[60]; BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; 102 FCR 97 at [48] ; and Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 , particularly at [294]---[302].</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">36 There is no causal link between any injury or alteration of position which might be found to have been incurred and the alleged prohibited reason in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">On one view, s 809 has no work to do in those circumstances (cf CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326 at [56] ---[60]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In any event, the evidence that was led for Tristar is inconsistent with the existence of any particular reason or intent connected with s 793(1)(i) notwithstanding that I accept that the length of service of the employees was a factor taken into account in not dismissing them because of the size of the severance payment which would have to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">As I have endeavoured to show, that does not establish that any conduct of Tristar was for a prohibited reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The manner in which the particular clause in the Certified Agreement worked out in practice does not fall within s 793(1)(i) as construed in the context of the rest of s 793(1), the rest of Pt 16 and the objects and structure of the Act as a whole ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">CONCLUSION 
 
37 Those conclusions mean that the case must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">There is no necessity to further consider the position of the "staff" employees who were not directly entitled to the benefit of the Certified Agreement, or to distinguish between the named employees in any other way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">There will be no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">I do not find that the proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause, although, in the end, I concluded that there is no basis for the relief claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">That conclusion was only arrived at after evidence, argument and analysis.</sentence>
