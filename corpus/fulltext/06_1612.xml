1 On 15 November 2006 a notice of motion was filed in this Court seeking to reopen a judgment of Lander J of 6 November 2006: see SZISF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1462.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">His Honour gave judgment in the absence of the applicant who did not appear at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">His Honour dismissed an application for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 31 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His Honour also refused leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Federal Magistrate dismissed as incompetent an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 26 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The order made by Lander J was entered on 8 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 Mr Markus, appearing for the Minister, appeared to accept that as a matter of jurisdiction a single judge exercising the Court's appellate jurisdiction had power to set aside the orders such as those made by Lander J, even though they had been entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Reference was made to the judgment of the Full Court in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 148 ALR 578 at 585.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 In any event, this Court has what should probably be described as an implied statutory power to set aside an order made in the absence of a party where that absence was due to no fault of the party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Support for that view is found in the judgment of the High Court in Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1979) 143 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 In support of her motion of 15 November 2006 the applicant has sworn an affidavit in which she deposed that she was mistaken as to where the proceedings were to be conducted and had gone to 88 Goulburn Street, Sydney rather than the Law Courts Building in Queens Square.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I infer that the applicant was informed of the proper time, date and place of the hearing (Law Courts Building, Queens Square) both by letter dated 26 September 2006 from the Australian Government Solicitor and by letter dated 21 September 2006 from the Court..</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Even accepting that the applicant was mistaken as to the venue for the hearing, it cannot be said that her absence was through no fault of her own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">She was informed of the correct address but failed to appear there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 Turning to the Federal Magistrate's decision, her Honour found as a matter of fact that the applicant had been notified on 26 May 2005 of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Under the transitional provisions of the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth), the applicant was deemed to have been notified of the Tribunal's decision on 1 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Pursuant to s 477(1) of the Act, any application for a review of the Tribunal's decision had to be made within 28 days, in this case, of 1 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That period could be extended by 56 days in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">However, after 84 days from 1 December 2005, the Federal Magistrates Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an application or an application for an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The 84 days expired on 23 February 2006 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
6 Accordingly, the application to the Federal Magistrates Court filed on 13 April 2006 was out of time and that Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This was the conclusion reached both by the Federal Magistrate and Lander J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is plainly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">No occasion therefore arises to consider whether the order of Lander J should be reopened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 This is not a case where the party was absent through no fault of her own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There are no exceptional circumstances warranting the reopening of the order and, in any event, the application that might arise from the reopening of the order would be doomed to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Accordingly, I dismiss with costs the motion filed on 15 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I order that those costs be fixed in the sum of $500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Associate:

Dated: 4 December 2006

 Date of Hearing: 23 November 2006 
 
 Date of Judgment: 23 November 2006
