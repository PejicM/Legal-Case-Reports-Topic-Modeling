 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In August 2006 Finland applied to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to extradite Jan Tervonen, one of its nationals, in respect of eight warrants for his arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The warrants had been issued by the Helsinki and the Tuusula District Courts between 2004 and 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The request was considered by the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Honourable Christopher Ellison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He gave a notice in writing under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 18 August 2006 that he had received an extradition request from Finland for a considerable number, but not all, of the offences specified in the eight warrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Senator Ellison's notice contained 56 numbered paragraphs which referred to 77 separate offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">2 Later in 2006, Mr Tervonen commenced these proceedings, challenging Senator Ellison's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I refused interlocutory relief on the basis of Mr Tervonen's challenges, as then formulated by him when he was self-represented: Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 464.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Shortly after I delivered my judgment, the Full Court of this Court handed down its decision in Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs (2007) 157 FCR 286.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I then appointed counsel under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth) to represent Mr Tervonen on the final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His counsel has reformulated Mr Tervonen's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">3 On 30 April 2007, before the date of the final hearing, Senator Ellison's successor in the office of Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Honourable David Johnston, signed what was intituled 'Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request' under s 16(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">That second s 16 notice was given in respect of all of the original offences in Senator Ellison's notice together with seven further ones identified in its paragraphs (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">4 Mr Tervonen has challenged the validity of each s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He argued that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid because:
 
 
 (1) the Minister did not have before him any statement of Mr Tervonen's conduct or his acts or omissions and so Senator Ellison could not form the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required, viz, that the same, or equivalent conduct, acts or omissions, if committed in Australia, would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The material before Senator Ellison was thus said to be so deficient (relying on Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45]) that the Minister could not have formed the opinion which s 16(2)(a)(ii) required;
 (2) the language of the Finnish warrants on their face was incapable of satisfying the definition of 'extraditable person' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act because they did not, in terms, seek his arrest as a person actually charged or accused of an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Rather, they sought his arrest on the basis that they alleged that he was 'suspected with probable cause' of having committed one or a number of offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Mr Tervonen said that the Minister could not have formed the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) in the absence of any material before him to establish that the formulation used in each of the Finnish warrants was in fact a warrant within s 6(a)(i);
 (3) Article 7(2) of the Treaty between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 7 June 1984 as amended by Article 3 of the Protocol between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985 contained in Schedule 2 of the Extradition (Finland) Regulations 1988 (Cth) required Finland to accompany its request for his extradition with a statement of each offence for which extradition was sought together with a statement of the acts or omissions which were alleged against Mr Tervonen in respect of each offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Tervonen argued that because in August 2006 Senator Ellison personally did not have before him all of this material, as required by the treaty, he could not issue the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 

5 However, Mr Tervonen's principal challenge was against Senator Johnston's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He argued that:
 
 
 (1) Senator Johnston as Minister for Justice and Customs was not able to exercise the statutory powers and functions specifically conferred on the Attorney-General by s 16 of the Act;
 (2) under the Act it is not open for the Attorney-General, or the Minister administering the Act, to issue a second notice in respect of the same request;
 (3) the particularisation of his acts and omissions in the material before Senator Johnston relating to pars (24)-(52), (57) and (58) of the second s 16 notice was insufficient to enable the Minister to form the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii), so that the whole notice was invalid or those paragraphs were;
 (4) the language of the Finnish warrants was incapable of satisfying the statutory definition of 'extraditable person' on the same basis as ground (2) in respect of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 

6 The Minister argued that Mr Tervonen's challenges should fail and that:
 
 
 &#8226; each notice was valid;
 &#8226; Senator Ellison's notice was not acted on by the magistrate, and so it was of no present relevance;
 &#8226; if any deficiency were established in respect of the material before either Minister in relation to particular paragraphs in their s 16 notices, those paragraphs should be severed and the balance of notice(s) would be valid;
 &#8226; Senator Johnston's s 16 notice was either a validly amended version of his predecessor's notice or a valid, newly made, s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 

7 On 6 June 2007 Mr Tervonen was committed to prison pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act by a magistrate at Central Local Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Finland did not rely on Senator Ellison's s 16 notice before the magistrate who acted on the basis that only Senator Johnston's s 16 notice was before him under s 19(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Tervonen has sought review of that order under s 21 of the Act and those proceedings are pending before Gyles J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">LEGISLATIVE SCHEME 
 
8 A principal object of the Act is to codify the law in relation to the extradition of persons from Australia to extradition countries without determining the guilt or innocence of a person whose extradition is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A second object is to enable Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties (s 3(a) and (c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Act is structured in a way that permits decisions to be taken at a number of points in the extradition process which may halt that process, either in part or entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Act contemplates four stages in the extradition process, namely: commencement, remand, determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender and executive determination that the person be surrendered: Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth (2006) 227 CLR 614 at 628 [29] per Gleeson CJ, 635-636 [55] per Gummow and Hayne JJ (with whom Heydon J agreed on this issue at 676 [222]), 657 [144] per Kirby J applying Harris v Attorney-General (Cth) (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr Tervonen's applications in the present case arise at an early point in the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">9 Initially an extradition country, here Finland, must make an application to a magistrate, sitting as persona designata , for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person under s 12(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">If the magistrate is satisfied, on the basis of the information given by affidavit, that the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country, the magistrate must issue the warrant in statutory form for the arrest of the person (s 12(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The magistrate must then send to the Attorney-General a report saying that he or she has issued the warrant together with a copy of the affidavit (s 12(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Attorney-General is then given a discretion, by s 12(3), to cancel the warrant where he or she decides not to issue a notice under s 16(1) in relation to the person or considers for any other reason that the warrant should be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Cancellation is effected by the Attorney-General directing the magistrate to cancel the warrant (s 12(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">10 If the warrant is not cancelled, the person, when found, is then arrested and must be brought before a magistrate in the State or Territory where the arrest occurs as soon as practicable (s 15(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Unless there are special circumstances justifying the remand of a person on bail, the magistrate must remand the person in custody for such period or periods that may be necessary for the proceedings to be brought, relevantly, under s 19 of the Act (s 15(2) and (6)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">11 The next stage in the process is that where the Attorney-General receives an extradition request from an extradition country in relation to a person, the Attorney-General is given a discretion by notice in writing in the statutory form expressed to be directed to any magistrate, to state that the request has been received (s 16(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">But, the Attorney-General can only give the notice if he or she is of the opinion that:
 
 
 &#8226; the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country (s 16(2)(a)(i)); and
 &#8226; if the conduct of the person constituting the extradition offence or offences for which his or her surrender is sought, or equivalent conduct, had taken place in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, that conduct or equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia (s 16(2)(a)(ii)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(This is known as the dual criminality requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">) 
 

12 Although I have summarised the effect of the relevant provisions of s 16, above, it is important to set out its terms in full, which are as follows:
 
 
 '16(1) Where the Attorney-General receives an extradition request from an extradition country in relation to a person, the Attorney-General may, in his or her discretion, by notice in writing in the statutory form expressed to be directed to any magistrate, state that the request has been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The Attorney-General shall not give the notice: 
 
 
 
 (a) unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion: 
 
 
 
 (i) that the person is an extraditable person in relation to the extradition country; and 
 
 (ii) that, if the conduct of the person constituting the extradition offence, or any of the extradition offences, for which surrender of the person is sought, or equivalent conduct, had taken place in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, the conduct or the equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the Attorney-General is of the opinion that there is an extradition objection in relation to the extradition offence, or all of the extradition offences, for which surrender of the person is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) As soon as practicable after the person is remanded under section 15 or the notice is issued, whichever is the later: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a copy of the notice; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) copies of the documents referred to in paragraph 19(2)(a) and, if applicable, paragraph 19(2)(b); 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 shall be given to the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 

13 The reference to 'conduct constituting an offence' in s 16(2)(a)(ii) is by force of s 10(2) a reference to the acts or omissions, or both, by virtue of which the offence has, or is alleged to have been, committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">And, in determining the criminality of the conduct complained of in relation to Australia, s 10(3) permits regard to be had to all, some or only one, of the acts or omissions relied on in the request for extradition and supporting material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">14 The definition of 'extraditable person' is found in s 6 which provides relevantly as follows:
 
 '6 Where: 
 
 (a) either: 
 
 (i) a warrant is or warrants are in force for the arrest of a person in relation to an offence or offences against the law of a country that the person is accused of having committed either before or after the commencement of this Act; or ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the offence or any of the offences is an extradition offence in relation to the country; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the person is believed to be outside the country; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the person is, for the purposes of this Act, an extraditable person in relation to the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

15 Contrary to Mr Tervonen's argument, the Act contemplates that a notice under s 16 can be later amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">For present purposes s 10(4) is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It provides that a reference in the Act to an extradition offence for which surrender of a person is sought by an extradition country is '... in relation to a time after the Attorney-General has given a notice under subsection 16(1) in relation to the person, a reference to any extradition offence to which the notice (including the notice as amended) relates'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It follows that amendment of a notice under s 16(1) is expressly contemplated in the Act, so there is no room for an implication denying the possibility of amendment for which Mr Tervonen contends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">16 Confirmation of this construction can be found in the explanatory memorandum for the Extradition Bill 1987 (Cth) in respect of cl 10(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">That read:
 
 'Sub-clause (4) defines the phrase "extradition offence/s for which surrender of a person is ought by an extradition country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Insofar as this phrase is used in any provision dealing with that part of the extradition process which follows the issue of a notice by the Attorney-General under clause 16, it relates only to those offences specified in the Attorney-General's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The provision also records that an Attorney-General's notice may be amended, for example, by the addition of new offences notified by the requesting country after the original request is received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 

This material is capable of supporting or confirming the construction at which I have arrived: s 15AB(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">17 Significantly, where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney-General decides not to issue a notice under s 16(1) or considers for any other reason that the person's remand should cease, he may by notice in writing direct a magistrate to order the person's release (s 17(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Where the person has been remanded under s 15 for 45 days (or such different number of days as may be provided in regulations made under s 11(2)) after the person was arrested and no notice under s 16(1) has been given, s 17(2) of the Act requires the person to be brought before a magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In that situation, the magistrate must order the person's release from custody unless he or she is satisfied that a notice is likely to be given within a particular period that is reasonable in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">If the magistrate acting under s 17(2) is satisfied that a notice under s 16(1) is likely to be given in relation to the person within a particular period and that notice is not given within the period, s 17(3) requires the person to be brought before a magistrate 'who shall order the release of the person from custody' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">18 The next stage of the process arises relevantly under s 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">A magistrate must conduct proceedings to determine whether a person is eligible for surrender in relation to the extradition offence or offences for which his or her surrender is sought by the extradition country once four conditions have been satisfied under s 19(1) , namely:
 
 
 &#8226; the person is on remand under s 15 ;
 &#8226; the Attorney-General has given a notice under s 16(1) in relation to the person;
 &#8226; an application is made to the magistrate by or on behalf of the person or the extradition country for proceedings to be conducted in relation to the person under s 19 ; and
 &#8226; the magistrate considers that the person and the extradition country had reasonable time in which to prepare for the conduct of those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 

19 It is apparent from this recital that a notice under s 16(1) has an important role in the statutory scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">First, a notice is necessary to authorise the remand of the person continuing beyond the 45 days referred to in s 17 (or other period provided in the Extradition Regulations 1988 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Secondly, a notice is a precondition to the exercise by a magistrate of jurisdiction under s 19 to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender at all (s 19(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">THE TREATY 
 
20 The Act has been modified, pursuant to s 11, in relation to Finland by reg 4 of the Extradition (Finland) Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Under s 11(1) a regulation may state that the Act applies subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to a bilateral extradition treaty in relation to a specified country, being a treaty a copy of which is set out in the regulations (s 11(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">And, s 11(1C) provides that the regulations can so provide by being expressed in the form that the Act applies to the country concerned subject to that treaty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Thus, the Treaty between Australia and Finland Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 7 June 1984 and the Protocol between Australia and Finland Amending the Treaty Concerning Extradition done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985, which are set out as Schedules 1 and 2 to the Extradition (Finland) Regulations, have the effect of amending the Act by force of s 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This requires the Act to be read so that it conforms with the treaty as amended in respect of Finland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">(I will refer to this simply as 'the treaty'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">)
 
21 The treaty contemplates that only offences punishable under both Finnish and Australian law by imprisonment for more than one year may give rise to extradition obligations between Australia and Finland (Art 2(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The treaty expressly provides that extradition shall also be granted for offences of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of offences referred to in Art 2(1), or being an accessory before or after the fact or attempting or conspiring to commit any of those offences (Art 2(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">22 Article 2(5) of the treaty provides that in determining whether an offence is an offence against the law of both Australia and Finland, 'the totality of the Acts or omissions alleged against the person whose surrender is sought shall be taken into account without reference to the elements of the offences prescribed by the law of the Requesting State'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Art 5(2) provides that a requesting State is to be afforded an opportunity to supplement its request before final determination on the request for extradition pursuant to that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Art 5 deals also with situations in which extradition may otherwise be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Critically, Art 7 provides:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">A request for extradition shall be made in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">All documents submitted in support of a request for extradition shall be duly authenticated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The request for extradition shall be accompanied: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) if the person is accused of an offence --- by warrant for the arrest or a copy of the warrant for the arrest of the person, a statement of each offence for which extradition is sought and a statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the fugitive in respect of each offence; 
 ... 
 
 (d) in all cases by documents setting out the relevant provision of the statute, if any, creating the offence or a statement of the relevant law as to the offence including any law relating to the limitation of proceedings, as the case may be, and in either case a statement of the punishment that can be imposed for the offence; 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">To the extent permitted by the law of each Contracting Party extradition may be granted to the person sought pursuant to the provisions of this Treaty notwithstanding that the requirements of paragraph 2 of this Article had not been complied with provided that the person sought consents to an order for his extradition being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">' 
 
 

23 If the requested State considers that the evidence or information furnished in support of a request for extradition is not sufficient in law, it may request that additional evidence or information be furnished within such time as it specifies (Art 9(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">If that material is not furnished or there is insufficient material, the person may be released from custody but that release, by force of Art 9(2), is not to preclude the requesting State from making a fresh request for the person's extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">SENATOR ELLISON'S S 16 NOTICE 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
24 Mr Tervonen was provisionally arrested on 4 July 2006 pursuant to s 12 of the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The 45 day period of his remand expired on 18 August 2006 (s 17(2)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Senator Ellison was informed by the Assistant Secretary of the International Crime Co-operation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department on 17 August 2006 of these matters and of the fact that Finland had made a request for Mr Tervonen's extradition on 2 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Minister was told that supplementary information in support of the request had been received only on 17 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">A briefing note to the Minister set out these background matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It attached each of the 8 warrants for Mr Tervonen's arrest issued by the Finnish Courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Mr Tervonen's extradition was sought in respect of nearly 100 fraud, company, accounting and tax offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">25 The Assistant Secretary recommended that the Minister sign the draft s 16 notice attached to the briefing paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Minister's attention was drawn to s 16(2) and the requirements of Art 7 of the treaty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He was advised that the requirements of s 16 of the Act and of the Treaty had been met for the offences listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Assistant Secretary's advice in relation to the questions which the legislation required to be addressed was contained in an attachment to the briefing note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Assistant Secretary also attached to the briefing note the advice of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions ('CDPP') on dual criminality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Senator Ellison was advised that he could be of the opinion that if Mr Tervonen had engaged in conduct constituting each of the Finnish offences listed in the s 16 notice in New South Wales at the time the extradition requested had been received (August 2006), each of the offences would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Minister was advised that some of the offences listed in Finland's extradition request had not been included in the draft s 16(1) notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">This was said to be because the CDPP could not establish dual criminality for those offences and so s 16(2)(a)(ii) could not be satisfied in respect of those offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">26 On 18 August 2006 Senator Ellison signed the s 16 notice without amending it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It described a total of 77 offences in 56 numbered subparagraphs, some of which related to one offence and others to more than one offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">MUST THE MINISTER RECEIVE ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY FINLAND IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE STATUTORY FUNCTION UNDER S 16?</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
27 Mr Tervonen argued that Art 7(2) of the Treaty required that the Minister personally must receive each document which had to accompany the request for extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He pointed to the terms of s 16(1) as referring to receipt of a request for extradition of a person and to s 11 and Art 7(2) as requiring a number of documents to accompany a request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">He asserted that such a construction followed because s 16 referred to the Attorney-General by name in connection with the performance of the functions and exercise of the powers conferred on that Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Mr Tervonen said this led to the inference that the Parliament intended the functions to be performed and the power to be exercised in their entirety by the Attorney-General, or responsible minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">28 A full and accurate summary of all material matters and facts ordinarily would enable a minister to discharge a function which legislation required be performed personally by the minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">A minister who acted on such a full and accurate summary would not have delegated any part of the decision-making process to the officials who prepared the summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">If, on the other hand, the summary or other material provided by the department or the minister's advisers omitted a material fact, then the minister would not make a decision on the basis of what parliament required him or her to take into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Thus the minister would not perform the very function which parliament intended be performed: cf: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 31 per Gibbs CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Indeed, depending on the volume of material, a full and accurate, but succinct, summary of material may assist a minister properly to perform the function of exercising the discretion personally confided upon him or her by the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">29 Where a statute requires a minister to exercise a discretion personally and the material put before him or her by the department fails to draw to his or her attention a relevant fact which is not insignificant or insubstantial, a valid decision cannot be made because the minister will not have before him or her all relevant material: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 30-31 per Gibbs CJ, 37-38 per Mason J, 65-67 per Brennan J, 71 per Dawson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If a department were to determine which facts or matters are provided to the minister for him or her to take into account to exercise such a discretion, then the decision-making function will be bifurcated impermissibly, because the department will have assumed a delegation of power which the statute did not permit: namely, the power to decide what facts and matters the minister may take into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">That bifurcation is not permitted where the statute requires the minister personally to exercise the discretion, for the reasons explained by Mason J in Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 37-38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">30 Thus, in order to form the opinion that a person is an extraditable person under s 16(2)(a)(i), the Attorney-General must consider whether the requirements of s 6 (which defines 'extraditable person') have been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">If the request for extradition is based on one or more warrants for the arrest of the person, the Attorney-General must be of opinion that each warrant has been received and that it satisfies the requirements of s 6 (and here, Art 7(2) of the treaty).</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The Attorney-General must see what has been provided with the request for extradition as the warrant (or its translation) in order to form the opinion in s 16(2)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It would not be sufficient for the Attorney-General merely to be told that such a warrant existed or to have a summary of it and its contents relating to the offence or offences concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">That is because the Act requires the Attorney-General to form an opinion that a warrant meeting the terms of s 6 actually exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">31 Article 7(2)(a) of the Treaty requires the request for extradition to be accompanied by a copy of the warrant together with the statement of each offence for which extradition is sought and a statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the person whose extradition is sought in respect of each offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The statement of each offence is a matter which may be capable of accurate summation, as may the statement of the acts or omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Much will depend upon the form in which the extradition country presents the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">As became apparent when the brief provided to Senator Johnston was tendered, he was confronted with over 250 pages of material which Finland had furnished in support of its request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The material was by no means easy to follow or digest in the form in which it was presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">As Brennan J said in Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 66:
 
 'The Parliament can be taken to intend that the Minister will retain control of the process of decision-making while being assisted to make the decision by departmental analysis, evaluation and pr&eacute;cis of the material relevant to that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">' 
 

32 I am of opinion that the Minister can form the opinion in relation to the conduct of the person for which s 16(2)(a)(ii) provides by use of a full and accurate summary of that conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">I reject Mr Tervonen's argument that s 16(2)(a) and or Art 7(2) of the treaty require the Minister to be provided with the full material furnished by Finland as the requesting State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">DID THE FINNISH WARRANTS SATISFY THE CRITERIA IN S 6(A)(I)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
33 Each of the Finnish warrants recited that Mr Tervonen was 'suspected on probable cause' of one or more offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Mr Tervonen argued that the language of the warrants did not meet the threshold set in s 6(a)(i) of being warrants which were in force for his arrest '... in relation to an offence ... against the law of [Finland] that the person is accused of having committed ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He argued that being suspected on probable cause was something less than being accused of having committed an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">34 He pointed to warrant 3 which stated that Mr Tervonen was 'suspected on probable cause' of four offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Under the heading 'Claims and Answers' the warrant recorded that a written claim for arrest was '... attached to this decision' and that the prosecutor '... said that a European Arrest Warrant and an international wanted notice would be issued against Tervonen in order to get him to respond to the charges against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The European Arrest Warrant will aim at the extradition of Tervonen for all the suspected offences, for which it will be possible to raise charges'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Warrant 2 contained a similar statement in respect of the offences it recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">35 Each of warrants 2 and 3 is dated 15 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The material prepared by Finland suggested that Mr Tervonen had left Finland immediately after being released from a sentence of imprisonment in August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Warrant 1, issued on 23 August 2004, recorded that Mr Tervonen had failed to attend the main hearing of his criminal case on that day despite having been summonsed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Warrant 1 recited that he had claimed to have been ill and that this information had been relayed by his female partner to Mr Tervonen's lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Warrants 2 and 3 referred to warrant 1 as showing that Mr Tervonen had failed to attend a court session without a legal excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">36 I am of opinion that the references to a European Arrest Warrant in warrants 2 and 3 were open to be considered by the Minister as reflecting a process then being considered for the purpose of having Mr Tervonen come before the Finnish Court system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Warrants 2 and 3 stated that the European Arrest Warrant and international wanted notice would be issued 'in order to get him to respond to the charges against him'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that provided a firm basis for the Minister to consider that those warrants reflected actual charges which had been brought by the Finnish prosecution authorities against Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The reference to 'all the suspected offences for which it will be probable to raise charges' in each of those warrants may be a reference to other charges which were either pending or, at that stage, proposed to be laid (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">warrant 4 was issued on 8 April 2005; warrant 5 was issued on 1 September 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">37 Mr Tervonen argued that on their face none of the 8 warrants amounted to an accusation that Mr Tervonen had actually committed an offence or that he was 'accused' of having done so within the meaning of s 6(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He said that a mere statement in the warrants that his arrest was claimed and that he was 'suspected with probable cause of the following criminal acts' which were then set out was insufficient to satisfy s 6(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">38 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; (1995) 185 CLR 528 at 540 Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word 'accused' in s 6(a)(i) of the Act, noting:
 
 'It is sufficient to say that, in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s 6(a)(i) of the Act, it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">' 
 

39 The Attorney-General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law: Williams 157 FCR at 298 [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s 6(a)(i) and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it (as the decision of the Full Court, which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer [1995] HCA 35 ; 185 CLR 528, illustrates).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">For this reason s 16(2)(a)(i) is framed so that the Attorney-General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">40 Having regard to the terms of the warrants and other material before him, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the opinion that they met the criterion in s 6(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Each warrant asserted that there was probable cause for suspecting that Mr Tervonen had committed an offence and that the Court which issued the warrant considered he ought be arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">41 In the context of Australian law, a statement that a person has been arrested by the police and charged with an offence is capable of bearing a meaning that the police suspected him or her of having committed the offence and that the arresting officers had reasonable cause for doing so: Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison [1982] HCA 50 ; (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 301 per Mason J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That case dealt with defamatory meanings that might be conveyed to ordinary, reasonable Australians by a statement of a police arrest and charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">42 Each warrant, on its face, was termed a 'warrant'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant, issued by a Finnish Court, in force, for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s 6(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">While other persons may not have formed the same view, having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia, to which Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer 185 CLR at 540, I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s 6(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">FURTHER MATERIAL BEFORE SENATOR JOHNSTON AS TO S 6(A)(I) 
 
43 Senator Johnston had Finland's request for extradition before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Finland stated there that it sought Mr Tervonen's extradition 'on the basis of the offences detailed in the appended warrants for arrest, for pre-trial investigation and prosecution'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Finland provided supplementary information dated 14 August 2006 in support of the request for extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">That was also before Senator Johnston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It stated that 'Tervonen's offences are white-collar crime of which it is very hard to get unambiguous evidence and for which trials many times take weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">At this stage of the procedure and investigations the information provided is as detailed as possible'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">44 This material provided an additional basis why it was open to Senator Johnston to form the opinion that Mr Tervonen was an extraditable person under s 16(2)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I am of opinion that it was open to him to have formed that opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">VALIDITY OF SENATOR ELLISON'S S 16 NOTICE 
 
45 In submissions, the Minister pointed out that the material presented to Senator Ellison for his consideration accorded with what, in Foster v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394, Cooper J had outlined was appropriate to be before him to form the opinions required by s 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">46 However, in Williams at 157 FCR at 296 [42], the Full Court held that Cooper J's approach was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">They held that s 16(2)(a)(ii) of the Act required the Minister to have before him or her a statement of what was alleged to have been actually done or omitted, not a mere restatement of the charge in respect of which extradition was sought: Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], 298 [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">In that case the material before the Minister had not included a statement of the elements of the offence in the extradition country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Gyles, Allsop and Buchanan JJ said ( Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50]):
 
 'The opinion which must be held by the Attorney General (or the responsible Minister) under s 16(2)(a)(ii) must relate to, and be based on, actual conduct said to constitute, in a factual sense, the commission of an identified offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In the present case there was no information before the Minister to furnish that knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Accordingly, the Minister was not in a position to form an opinion about Mr Williams' conduct, whether in reliance on advice or personally, so as to conclude that the requirements of s 16(2)(a)(ii) were met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">As a result the opinion was not validly formed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">' 
 

47 The CDPP's advice on dual criminality which was before Senator Elllison discussed each of the sets of charges in the 8 warrants separately, some with greater, and some with lesser, detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">That advice was the only source of information before Senator Ellison as to the conduct of Mr Tervonen for the purpose of his forming an opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) whether, if equivalent conduct had occurred in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, that conduct or equivalent conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">48 Articles 7(2)(a) and (d) of the treaty required that the request for extradition should be accompanied by the warrant, a statement of the offence for which extradition was sought and 'a statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the fugitive in respect of each offence', together with a statement of the relevant Finnish enactment creating the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Finland had provided all this material to the department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">References to Finnish statutory provisions were set out in the CDPP's advice, but none of the text of the relevant legislation was included in the material provided to Senator Ellison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">So, apart from the warrants, the Minister did not have before him any of the material concerning Mr Tervonen's conduct which Finland had provided under Art 7 of the treaty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">EXAMPLES OF THE MATERIAL BEFORE SENATOR ELLISON 
 
49 Warrant 1 was issued by Helsinki District Court on 23 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The first offence which it identified was in the following terms:
 
 'The offences of which Tervonen is suspected on probable cause and for which the Prosecutor demands punishment for Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">
 
 1) Aggravated fraud between 22 May and 01 October 2002, Helsinki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">' 
 

50 The information in the CDPP's advice before Senator Ellison concerning offence 1 in Warrant 1, and Mr Tervonen's conduct, was as follows:
 
 
 ' WARRANT 1 --- 23/8/04 --- HELSINKI DISTRICT COURT 
 
 Offence 1 --- Aggravated Fraud --- Chapter 36, section 2(1) Penal Code 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The allegation is that Tervonen and others misled a number of parties to deliver goods or services to them on credit or against invoices with no intention or financial ability to pay for the orders, thereby causing a loss to the injured parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">They gained control of, and used a company, Teemun Purku, the board member and managing director of which was Teemu Liukkonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Liukkonen in reality did not have control over the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Accounts were opened with an overdraft facility with several suppliers and service providers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The goods and services were ordered from those companies using the name Teemu Liukkonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Each of the companies which delivered goods and services is specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">However, it is not stated in each case whether the particular company actually lost money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">In some cases it is stated that there was a loss to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">If it is accepted that at the time the orders were placed, there was no intention or ability to pay for the goods, the conduct would amount to obtaining a valuable thing or a financial advantage by deception contrary to section 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The maximum penalty for an offence against section 178BA is imprisonment for 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">' 
 
 

51 This offence became the subject of par (1) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The elements of Chapter 36, section 2(1) of the Penal Code were not before the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">As the Full Court recognised in Williams 157 FCR at 298 [49], the Attorney-General or responsible Minister cannot be taken to be an expert in the foreign law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Rather, the Minister must be expected to form a view about whether identified acts or omissions (or equivalent conduct) would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">52 The allegations concerning Mr Tervonen were set out in the CDPP's advice at a level of generality which did not identify any precise act or omission which Mr Tervonen himself was alleged to have done or omitted to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Rather, Mr Tervonen and others were alleged to have misled a number of parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">This allegation did not identify what Mr Tervonen, or the others for that matter, did to mislead any person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Next, the CDPP's summary asserted that Mr Tervonen and the others gained control of a company in circumstances where its managing director was said not to have control over it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">53 The CDPP's advice did not put before Senator Ellison any act or omission of Mr Tervonen relating to:
 
 
 &#8226; his or 'the others' gaining control over the company or overriding its director;
 &#8226; why the director 'in reality did not have control over the company';
 &#8226; the opening of accounts 'with an overdraft facility with several suppliers and service providers';
 &#8226; what an 'overdraft facility' was or how it was operated on for that purpose;
 &#8226; how the goods and services were ordered from the supplier companies 'using the name' of the director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">
 

54 Next, the CDPP noted that while each company which delivered goods or services had been specified, the Finnish authorities had not stated whether each company concerned had suffered any loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">55 There may be differences between Finnish law and Australian law as to duplicity in bringing criminal charges: see Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">However, in relation to an equivalent Australian offence for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii) it was essential for the material before Senator Ellison to identify particular conduct of Mr Tervonen or its equivalent, which would have constituted, without duplicity, an offence here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The particular acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen in placing an order needed to be identified, together with the basis on which that conduct could have amounted to the obtaining of a valuable or financial advantage by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">56 However, there was a lack of any particularity in the material on which Senator Ellison was asked to form an opinion that s 178BA of the Crimes Act would have been contravened had Mr Tervonen engaged in the same or equivalent conduct in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In a broad way, the CDPP's summary suggested a connection between Mr Tervonen and others in misleading third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">But, the CDPP did not set out who lacked an intention or ability to pay for the goods, or what Mr Tervonen's role was in relation to the formation of that intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Given that it is implicit in the CDPP's summary that some goods were either actually paid for or no loss was suffered as a result of the order, there may have been a real issue about the proof of any preliminary intention not to pay in a particular instance and whether a particular company or companies was deceived into supplying goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">A company that was ultimately paid in full for goods it sold or which never delivered goods would hardly have conferred a financial advantage on the recipient by means of the deception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">As Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 487:
 
 'Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">For, except to prove intent or system and to exclude accident or mistake, evidence that accused persons committed other like offences is seldom relevant to the issue of guilt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">But, if the present case fell within the prima facie rule, plainly to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law, and the fact that each satisfied the description contained in the complaint could afford no justification for such a breach of so important a rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">' 
 

57 This passage highlights the necessity that the facts must be stated in such a way that the Minister can be satisfied that the particular conduct, being acts or omissions of the person whose extradition is sought, would have been sufficient to constitute an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Dixon J explained that a prosecutor must identify not only the legal nature of the offence with which a defendant is charged, but also the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge: Johnson v Miller 59 CLR at 489-490; see too John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42 ; (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 520-521 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; see Williams 157 FCR at 298 [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The position is similar in respect of European arrest warrants: Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31 at 52 [48] per Lord Hope of Craighead with whom the rest of the House agreed on this issue: see at 39 [2], 58-59 [71], 59 [72], 61 [82].</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">58 The global summary contained in the CDPP's advice stated a conclusion drawn from primary material which was not separately stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The conclusion was embarrassing in terms of identifying what offence was committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It left the reader to guess or speculate about what the acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen were which led to the stated conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Nor was it clear whether Mr Tervonen obtained the advantage alleged as a principal or whether he aided and abetted others to obtain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">59 No doubt the Minister often would be assisted by advice from the CDPP in forming an opinion for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Such advice can distil or summarise material, but the Minister must still be provided with all of the conduct (acts or omissions) of the person whose extradition is sought on which he or she must form an opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Since all that was before Senator Ellison was the CDPP's unspecific summary of the conclusions he drew from fuller material there was no basis on which the Minister could form an opinion about what Mr Tervonen did or omitted to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Nor was the person identified who obtained any financial advantage by deception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">60 For these reasons, I am of opinion that the statement in the CDPP's advice of the basis for offence 1 in warrant 1 is so deficient in detail and particularity that the Minister could not reasonably have been satisfied on that material that any acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen, or equivalent if committed in New South Wales, could have established a contravention of s 178BA of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">There was, therefore, no basis on which Senator Ellison could have formed the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of offence 1 in warrant 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">61 The CDPP's advice in relation to offence 1 in Warrant 1 was more detailed than in respect of some other offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">That advice was the sole source before Senator Ellison from which he could inform himself of Mr Tervonen's conduct in forming an opinion for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Of course, the CDPP had other material before him on which he based his advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">But the deficiency of the CDPP's advice as the basis for Senator Ellison to form an opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) is illustrated by the above example and those which follow below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">62 The CDPP's advice in relation to offence 2 in warrant 1, which became the subject of par (2) in the notice, was similar in its failure to identify any act or omission of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Thus, the concrete exercise described by Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ in Truong v The Queen [2004] HCA 10 ; (2004) 223 CLR 122 at 142 [29] , 143 [33] (and see too per Hayne J at 185 [189], 187 [196]-[197]) could not be performed because the description of the factual elements failed to identify acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">63 Similarly the CDPP's advice in relation to offence 4 in warrant 1, which became the subject of par (3) in the notice, asserted that Mr Tervonen acted in concert with one Seppala and 'ordered, hired or otherwise intentionally persuaded three persons to order goods from various suppliers' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Once again, this description is too general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">If the case were based on circumstantial evidence, the acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen from which the inference of his complicity could be drawn needed to be stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Did Mr Tervonen order one of the three people to do something?</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Did he hire one of them to do it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Did he 'otherwise intentionally persuade' someone?</sentence>

<sentence id="s249">As Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ observed in Truong 223 CLR at 143 [33] (in relation to whether a person extradited to Australia on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and murder a man could be convicted of the substantive offences of the kidnap and murder by procuring them to occur):
 
 'Agreement (here, agreement to commit a crime) is the essence of conspiracy, but the nature and scope of the alleged agreement is important when performing the exercise, required by the statute, of identifying the acts or omissions by virtue of which the particular offence of conspiracy in question has, or is alleged to have, been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">' 
 

64 The generality and abstraction of the CDPP's description of offence 4 in warrant 1 was such that Senator Ellison could not have formed the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of par (3) of his s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">There was a similar absence of acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen in the material before Senator Ellison in respect of the following:
 Warrant Offence number in warrant Paragraph number in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice 1 5 4 1 8 6 1 9 7 1 10 8 1 11 9 2 1 and 2 10 2 5 12

45-56 24-52
(see below) 7 1 55 8 1 56
(see below) 

 
65 Offence 5 in warrant 2 was described as a registration offence under Chapter 16, section 7(1) of the Finnish Penal Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">This became the subject of par (12) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The CDPP described it in these terms:
 
 'The allegation is that [Mr] Tervonen, together with others, provided false information to the National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland by providing information to be entered in the register ...' 
 

that three named persons had taken up particular positions in respect of a company when none of them had consented to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The CDPP continued:
 
 'Whilst it is not directly stated in the acts and omissions, there is a reference under the heading Evidence to the fact that the signatures of [two of the persons] have not been made by the persons themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">If the magistrate accepts that this information forms part of the statement of acts and omissions, the conduct may amount to an offence of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">' 
 

66 The question for Senator Ellison was not whether the magistrate could accept whether the information formed part of the statement of the acts or omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Rather the Minister's statutory duty was to form an opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) whether Mr Tervonen's conduct, acts and omissions before him, had they or equivalent conduct occurred in New South Wales, would have constituted an extradition offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The way in which Mr Tervonen was alleged to have provided false information was not stated in the material before Senator Ellison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">67 Moreover, s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provided that the person who used the instrument had to know it to be false and to use it with the intention of inducing another person to accept that it was genuine and, because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that person's or another's detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The CDPP's advice did not identify what Mr Tervonen's conduct was beyond the conclusion that he provided false information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The role of the 'others' with whom he was alleged to have acted was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Nor did the CDPP's advice address his knowledge of the falsity or his intention in providing the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">68 Since the Minister did not have any more detail than that above, he could not have formed the opinion that he did in relation to offence 5 in warrant 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">69 Similarly, the discussion of warrant 4 in the CDPP's advice contained no acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen from which Senator Ellison could form any opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">For example, the CDPP described offence 1 in warrant 4, which became the subject of par (17) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice, in totality, as follows:
 
 ' Offence 1 --- Aggravated Tax Fraud --- Chapter 29, Section 2 Penal Code 
 
 
 
 53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">If it is accepted that Tervonen is an officer of Creative Builders Oy, within the meaning in the Corporations Act, his conduct may amount to an offence of dishonest use of position contrary to section 184(1) or section 184(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">
 
 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The maximum penalty for an offence against section 184(1) and section 184(2) is imprisonment for 5 years (Schedule 3, Item 30).</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">' 
 
 

70 Senator Ellison did not have before him any description of any act or omission of Mr Tervonen which the CDPP referred to as 'his conduct'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Senator Ellison could not have formed an opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) as to how Mr Tervonen used any position as an officer of the company or, indeed, if he could be found to be an officer of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The opening words 'If it is accepted that Tervonen is an officer' begged the question as to what basis there was for considering that he could have been an officer of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">No conduct at all was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">There was no basis on which Senator Ellison could form any opinion in relation to Mr Tervonen's conduct referred to, whatever it was, under Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">71 Warrant 5 claimed that Mr Tervonen was:
 
 '... suspected with probable cause of the following criminal acts:

 Grounds 
 
 The grounds are detailed in the appended claim for arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">' 
 
 

72 There was no appended claim for arrest included in the material before Senator Ellison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The CDPP commenced his consideration of warrant 5 by stating:
 
 ' It is alleged that Tervonen was involved in a scheme with a number of other persons in which they hired persons by the name Soderqvist and Raappana to make application for loans using false documentation and thereby have the real estate registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">
 
 
 
 75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The advice in relation to these offences is premised on the fact that if a Magistrate accepts that the acts and omissions are sufficient , offences would be found for dual criminality purposes based upon aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of those offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">
 
 Offences 1 and 2 --- Aggravated Forgery --- Chapter 33, section 2 Penal Code 
 
 Offence 3 --- Registration Offence --- Chapter 16, section Penal Code

<sentence id="s297">The maximum penalty for the offence against s.300(1) is imprisonment for 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">' (emphasis added)
 
 

73 The CDPP's description of offences 1, 2 and 3 in warrant 5 became the subject of pars (24) and (25) in Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The only act or omission referred to by the CDPP explaining Mr Tervonen's alleged conduct in relation to all of the offences in warrant 5 was his involvement in a scheme with a number of other persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">There was no identification of what he did to be 'involved in a scheme'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Nor was there any statement of what Mr Tervonen did or omitted to do from which a judgment could be made as to the sufficiency of those acts or omissions or equivalent conduct to establish an offence under ss 300(1) or (2) of the Crimes Act by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">As the CDPP said, his advice was premised on a magistrate accepting that the (unspecified) acts and omissions of Mr Tervonen were sufficient on which to find dual criminality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The CPDD's further discussion of the basis upon which the large number of charges under warrant 5 could be established did not provide or identify any acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">74 The absence of any detail as to Mr Tervonen's conduct was even more pronounced in the offences the subject of pars (35)-(40) and (45)-(52) in Senator Ellison's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">These were included without any conduct at all being identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">For example, the 9 offences described in par 9 of warrant 5, as 'three registration offences and six counts of forgery', were discussed by the CDPP in the following cursory way:
 
 ' Offences 48, 49 and 50 --- Registration Offence --- Chapter 16, section 2 Penal Code 
 
 Offences 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 --- Forgery --- Chapter 33 section 1 Penal Code 
 
 
 
 113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Offences 48, 49 and 50 --- using a false instrument contrary to s.300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) --- maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">
 
 114.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Offences 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 --- using a false instrument contrary to s.300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) --- maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">' 
 
 

75 These offences became the subject of pars (51) and (52) of Senator Ellison's notice which read as follows:
 
 
 '(51) Three counts of Registration Offence between 1 January 2004 and 17 March 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 16, section 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">
 
 (52) Six counts of Forgery between 1 January 2004 and 17 March 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 33, section 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">' 
 
 

76 The CDPP's consideration of offences 48, 49 and 50 in warrant 5 was confined simply to setting out a number for each of the offences, describing it in a general way and referring to the section of the Finnish statute to which the numbered offence related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">There was no information whatsoever provided about the registration offences, let alone the conduct of Mr Tervonen alleged to give rise to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">The Minister had no information about any conduct of Mr Tervonen in respect of offences 48, 49 and 50 on which to form the opinion required in s 16(2)(a)(ii) to justify him signing the s 16 notice based on this material: Williams 157 FCR at 296-297 [45], 298 [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Other offences were included in Senator Ellison's notice, such as aggravated fraud and aggravated forgery (pars (46) and (47)) without any discussion about what the conduct was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The Minister formally conceded that pars (34)-(52) of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice should be severed from his notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">This concession was said to be made because the Minister did not have sufficient material before him to enable him to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of pars (34)-(52).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">It was correctly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">77 Warrant 8 asserted that Mr Tervonen was suspected 'with probable cause' of the following criminal act:
 
 'Aggravated dishonesty by a debtor, 25 June 2001 to 5 July 2001, Helsinki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">' 
 

Warrant 8 stated that the grounds on which that charge was based were detailed in an appended claim for arrest, but no such claim for arrest was included in the material before Senator Ellison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">78 The CDPP's advice discussed this count, which became the subject of par (56) of Senator Ellison's notice, as follows:
 
 ' Offence 1 --- Aggravated Dishonesty by a Debtor --- Chapter 39, section 1a, Penal Code 
 
 
 
 125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">If it is accepted that Tervonen was an officer of the company within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) , his conduct may amount to an offence of an officer dishonestly using his position with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for themselves or someone else, or causing a detriment to the corporation; or (b) recklessly as to whether the use may result in themselves or someone else directly or indirectly gaining an advantage, or in causing detriment to the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">
 
 126.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">The maximum penalty for an offence against section 184(1) or section 184(2) the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) , is imprisonment for 5 years (Schedule 3, Item 30).</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">' (emphasis added)
 
 

79 Once again, the CDPP's advice did not identify the acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen or the basis on which he could be found to have been an officer of whatever company it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Because no conduct of Mr Tervonen was identified in the material before Senator Ellison in relation to this charge, he could not have formed the opinion that s 16(2)(a)(ii) required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">SUFFICIENCY OF MATERIAL BEFORE SENATOR ELLISON 
 
80 In some sections of the advice of the CDPP which were before Senator Ellison, there was material which could amount to a sufficient description of Mr Tervonen's alleged acts or omissions to enable the Minister to form an opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">However, in respect of pars (1)-(4), (6)-(10), (12), (17)-(22), (24)-(52) and (56) of the s 16 notice there was such a dearth of material before the Minister describing Mr Tervonen's acts or omissions that it would not be possible to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) as to the criminality of Mr Tervonen had he been charged in New South Wales with like offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">81 The s 16 notice which Senator Ellison gave was deficient, at least in respect of the paragraphs I have indicated above, because he had no material before him on which he could have formed the opinion s 16(2)(a)(ii) required before he gave the s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">IS SEVERANCE OF SENATOR ELLISON'S S 16 NOTICE POSSIBLE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">
 
82 That raises the question as to whether Senator Ellison's notice was wholly invalid or only partly so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The Minister argued that I should sever those paragraphs which he conceded, or I have found, to be incapable of being supported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">83 The Minister relied on authorities on severance of portions of search warrants in support of his argument that the invalid portions should be severed from Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">There, courts have held that it is possible to sever those parts of a warrant which were issued in excess of power: see per McHugh JA in Peters v Attorney-General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24 at 41D-42B and per Hely J in Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301 ; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at 210-211 [151] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">84 The principle upon which those decisions proceeded was an application of provisions such as ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">These evince a legislative intention to preserve the validity of so much of an enactment, action or instrument authorised by law as would be supported by use of the power relied upon, notwithstanding that some other part of the enactment, action or instrument in question has been found to be beyond the power relied upon for its making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Thus, s 46(2) provides that if any instrument, such as a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act , made pursuant to an enactment would be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, '... it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">A search warrant has been held to be such an instrument, as McHugh JA pointed out in Peters 16 NSWLR at 41E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Accordingly, he held that the search warrants in that case were to be read and construed, to the extent that they could be read, as valid instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">He applied what Dixon J had said in Andrews v Howell [1941] HCA 20 ; (1941) 65 CLR 255 at 281 in relation to ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">A notice under s 16 of the Act is also such an instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">85 In Andrews 65 CLR at 281 Dixon J said such provisions imposed a burden upon those attacking an entire regulation, part of which was bad, to establish that if the regulation were confined within the limits of the power, the result would be, not a partial application of the law, but a different provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Alternatively, the attacker had to establish that it was the intention of the Act or Regulation which authorised the making of an instrument, that unless the instrument received its full intended operation, it should not operate at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">86 Later, in Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth (The Bank Nationalisation Case) [1948] HCA 7 ; (1948) 76 CLR 1 at 370-371 Dixon J expanded upon the principles applicable to the construction of legislation or actions done under the authority of legislation where provisions such as ss 15A and 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) displaced the common law doctrine of severance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He explained that there was a common law presumption that the legislature intended its will on any particular matter as expressed in a statute to operate in its entirety and had no intention that something less should be the law (76 CLR at 371; see too The King v Poole; Ex parte Henry [No 2] [1939] HCA 19 ; (1939) 61 CLR 634 at 651 per Dixon J; Victoria v The Commonwealth (The Industrial Relations Act Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1996) 187 CLR 416 at 502 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ; Harrington v Lowe [1996] HCA 8 ; (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 326 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In the Bank Nationalisation Case 76 CLR at 371 Dixon J discussed ss 15A and the then form of s 46(b) (cp now: s 46(2)) of the Acts Interpretation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">He said that in applying those provisions:
 
 '... the courts have insisted that a provision, though in itself unobjectionable constitutionally, must share the fate of so much of the statute, regulation or order as is found to be invalid, once it appears that the rejection of the invalid part would mean that the otherwise unobjectionable provision would operate differently upon the persons, matters or things falling under it or in some other way would produce a different result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">This consideration supplies a strong logical ground for holding provisions to be inseverable, whether the prima-facie presumption be in favour or against severability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It is important where there is no statutory clause like s. 15A and it is important in using s. 15A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">For the inference in such a case is strong that provisions so associated form an entire law and that no legislative intention existed that anything less should operate as a law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">
 
 Further, where severance would produce a result upon the persons and matters affected different from that which the entire enactment would have produced upon them, had it been valid, it might be said with justice that unless the legislature had specifically assented to that result, contingently on the failure of its primary intent, it could not amount to a law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">' 
 

87 When Peters 16 NSWLR 24 was affirmed in Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4 ; (1990) 169 CLR 307 the issue of severance of the warrants was put to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that it was clear that a warrant could, and had, to be construed so as not to do what the statute under which it was authorised itself did not purport to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">They held a State statute did not purport to authorise a breach of a federal law, s 219B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">They found that the warrants in that case were wholly valid ( Love 169 CLR at 323).</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">88 It is important to bear in mind that in determining whether a notice given by the Attorney-General or Minister is wholly or partly valid for the purposes of s 16 of the Extradition Act , one of the significant effects of the notice is that it will authorise the detention in custody of the person who is its subject: Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ noted that a search warrant authorised an invasion of premises without the consent of the persons in lawful possession or occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">They said that the validity of such a warrant was necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the Court noted that the legislature had sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions to his privacy and property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">They noted that in enacting the section authorising the issue of search warrants, the Queensland legislature had given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">However, the Court pointed out that the common law had long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">They then discussed the exceptions which many State and Commonwealth statutes had made to the common law position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">They said ( George 170 CLR at 110-111):
 
 'Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">' 
 

89 In Williams 157 FCR at 296 [40] the Full Court observed that cases such a Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-276, Avon Downs v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J and Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119 per Gibbs J identified two relevant principles upon which the Court may examine, on judicial review, the validity of a notice under s 16 of the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">They said that the Court could examine whether the decision-maker had or had not taken relevant, and only relevant, matters into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">If that examination resulted in a conclusion that the material relied on by the Minister was open to be considered, '... there is a further, strictly limited but nevertheless potentially available, basis for review which focuses upon the outcome of the decision-making process'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">That basis involved whether the decision-maker acted in good faith and had not acted merely arbitrarily or capriciously: Buck 135 CLR at 118-119 per Gibbs J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">90 There is no suggestion here that the Minister acted otherwise than in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The question is whether, on the evidence, Senator Ellison can be found simply to have relied upon the advice of the CDPP without himself forming independently an opinion on any of the material before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">This is relevant to the application of s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act to save some parts of the s 16 notice when, had the correct test been applied by the Minister, he would have see the patent deficiency of the material to support a great number of the matters included in the draft s 16 notice which he gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">That is to say, the material indicates that the Minister simply accepted the CDPP's advice or opinion without himself independently forming his own opinion or examining the basis of that advice either at all or with the correct test in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">91 In The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 119-120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ referred to the important distinction between a mere insufficiency of evidence or other materials to support a conclusion of fact when the function of finding the fact has been committed to a person or body by the Parliament and, on the other hand, the absence of any foundation in fact for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which, in point of law, the existence of the power depends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">They said that it was not enough if the repository of the power, properly interpreting the section of the Act under which it was conferred and applying the correct test:
 
 '... nevertheless satisfies itself or himself on inadequate material that facts exist which in truth would fulfil the conditions which one or other or both of those paragraphs prescribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The inadequacy of the material is not in itself a ground for prohibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">But it is a circumstance which may support the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact.</sentence>

92 In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 223-224 [39] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to this principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">They distinguished it from a situation where a decision-maker did not give any reason for his or her decision, when the Court may be able to infer that he had no good reason (cf: per Gibbs CJ in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664).</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">93 A decision-maker must give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case: Khan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1987) 14 ALD 291 at 292 per Gummow J; Zhang v Canterbury City Council [2001] NSWCA 167 ; (2001) 51 NSWLR 589 at 601 [62] where Spigelman CJ collected the authorities; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 367 [138] per Kirby J; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at 92-93 [212] per Madgwick J, 96 [229] per Conti J; SZEJF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 724 at [39] , [60] where I applied this principle.</sentence>

<sentence id="s383">First, where a judgment is to be made by the repository of a power, if the statute requires there to be some facts upon which the judgment is to be exercised, the Court may enquire into whether those facts exist.</sentence>

<sentence id="s385">If these requirements are not met, then the exercise of judgment, however bona fide it may be, becomes capable of challenge ...'

94 In George v Rockett 170 CLR at 111 the Court considered the function of a justice in issuing a search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The terms of the statute were that it had to 'appear to the justice' that certain conditions existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The Court held that this imposed on the decision-maker the duty of satisfying himself or herself that the conditions for the issue of the warrant were fulfilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">95 The real question here is whether Senator Ellison properly directed himself as to the matters he had to take into account: see also Minister for Immigration v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 233 [27] per Gleeson CJ, 241 [58] per Gaudron and McHugh JJ, 250 [97] per Kirby J; see too Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">96 While s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act requires the Court to approach the continued operation of an instrument, part of which has been made in excess of power, with a presumption of validity, that does not deny the application of the principle identified in Australian Stevedoring 88 CLR at 119-120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">If the Court comes to the conclusion that in truth the power of the Attorney-General to give a notice under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise did not exist in law and in fact, namely, that the opinion had not been formed under s 16(2)(a)(ii) , then s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act will not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">This is because of the requirement that unless the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) has been formed by the Attorney-General on a proper basis, the chapeau in s 16(2) provides that he or she shall not give the notice under s 16(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">97 In Coco v The Queen [1994] HCA 15 ; (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 442-443 Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ rejected an argument concerning the severability of a warrant that had been issued by a judge whom, they held, had misapprehended the power which the statute conferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Their Honours held that the judge had purported to exercise a power different from the power reposed in him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">98 I am of opinion that Senator Ellison, likewise, purported to exercise a power different from that which the statute reposed in him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Had Senator Ellison approached the function of forming the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in accordance with law (as it had subsequently been declared in Williams 157 FCR 286), he would have noticed the deficiencies in the material before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">He would then have considered that many of the proposed paragraphs of the draft notice which he signed were not justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">I am satisfied that he did not consider the material before him in the way in which s 16(2) required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Rather, the inference which I am satisfied should be drawn is that Senator Ellison deferred to or accepted the opinion of the CDPP without himself considering any of the conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Senator Ellison simply accepted the CDPP's advice as authorising him to sign the s 16(1) notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">99 While I have found that Senator Ellison erred in his approach, that error was understandable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">I am not intending to criticise him in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">He did not have the benefit of the decision, given months later, in Williams 157 FCR 286, but he acted on the then state of the law as interpreted by Cooper J in Foster 97 A Crim R 560; 158 ALR 394.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">100 The filter which the Parliament intended be applied to extradition requests under s 16 was the formation of a genuine and real opinion by the Attorney-General, or other Minister exercising the power to give a notice under s 16(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">A notice under s 16 provides a lawful authorisation for the continuing detention of a person pursuant to the operation of s 17 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The Court should not impute to the Parliament an intention to authorise interference with the fundamental right to liberty where it does not appear that the Attorney-General or Minister actually turned his or her mind to the question s 16(2) requires be addressed: Coco 179 CLR at 537; see too Vasiljkovic 227 CLR at 618 [6], 629 [34] per Gleeson CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">101 There is no basis to sever portions of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">He never formed the opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) based on considering Mr Tervonen's alleged conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">That step was a precondition of the exercise of the power to give the notice, as s 16(2) provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">As Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ said in Truong 223 CLR at 142 [29] the exercise required by s 16 is a concrete one, not an abstract one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">They said it was to proceed by reference to the actual conduct alleged against the person in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">102 Moreover, I am unable to conclude that Senator Ellison applied the correct test in considering those parts of the s 16 notice which were supportable on the material before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">There is no basis to think he applied two different tests, the correct one to the material in the CDPP's advice which contained sufficient acts and omissions of Mr Tervonen to justify one or more paragraphs in the draft notice, and the incorrect one to the balance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">That would be irrational.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">The Minister simply did not apply the right test of forming his own opinion on the manner laid down in Williams 157 FCR 286.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Thus, the whole notice was invalid and there was nothing on which s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act could operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">103 The danger in the Courts being more executive-minded than the executive was highlighted by Lord Atkin's famous dissent in Liversidge v Anderson [1941] UKHL 1 ; [1942] AC 206 at 244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">104 In exercising his power under s 16(1) to give the notice, Senator Ellison asked himself the wrong question, namely whether his advisors considered that the notice should be issued and were satisfied of any matters which the statute required, including the formation of an opinion as to dual criminality under s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The qualification on the Attorney-General's power to issue a notice under s 16(1) imposed by the requirement of the formation of the various opinions under s 16(2) is an important safeguard for the person whose extradition is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">If in truth the Attorney-General, or Minister exercising the power in s 16(1) to give a notice, does not address for himself or herself the formation of the opinions on a proper factual basis under s 16(2) then the function of giving the notice has not been fulfilled in accordance with the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">105 I am of opinion that Senator Ellison did not consider whether Mr Tervonen's acts or omissions or equivalent conduct, had it taken place in Australia at the time at which the extradition request was received, would have constituted an extradition offence in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Rather, he accepted the opinions of others without examining the facts upon which those opinions were based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">This was not a performance of his statutory function in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">The whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">106 That being so, the question then arises as to the proper relief which ought to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">In my opinion I should make an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition prohibiting further proceedings upon that notice and I should make an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">SHOULD RELIEF BE GRANTED IN RESPECT OF SENATOR ELLISON'S S 16 NOTICE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">
 
107 If Senator Ellison's s 16 notice were invalid, Mr Tervonen argued that then Senator Johnston had no power to issue his s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The Minister's principal submission was that it would be futile to grant relief in respect of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice because the proceedings for Mr Tervonen's s 19 hearing had been taken on Senator Johnston's s 16 notice: see Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 159 FCR 181 at 194 [48] per Besanko J, with whom Moore and Buchanan JJ agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">108 In order to determine whether relief would be futile for this reason, it is necessary to examine the consequence of any finding that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly or partly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 1016 ; (1999) 92 FCR 575 at 578 [13] Wilcox, Whitlam and Moore JJ held that once a notice under s 16 was given, it could not be withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">In arriving at that result they relied upon the existence of the Attorney-General's power under s 17(1) to cause a person's remand to cease after a s 16 notice had been issued in the event that the Attorney-General did not wish that proceedings under s 19 commence ( Dutton 92 FCR at 578 [12]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">109 Under the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (Cth), there was a similar time limit (of 45 days after arrest) imposed for the giving of a notice by the Attorney-General as is now contained in s 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Beaumont J held that that time limit under the repealed Act did not prohibit the bringing of multiple, subsequent, applications for extradition: Zoeller v Attorney-General (Cth) (1987) 16 FCR 153 at 162.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">He suggested that if multiple applications were made a remedy could be sought by the person whose extradition was sought based on the power of the Court to prevent an abuse by the Attorney-General of the exercise of the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The question presented here is different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">There is no suggestion of abuse in Senator Johnston's issuing a new notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">110 If Senator Ellison's notice could not be withdrawn, then its status at the time Senator Johnston gave his s 16 notice must be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">If Senator Ellison's notice were wholly or partly valid, Senator Johnston would have power to amend it pursuant to s 10(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">But if Senator Ellison's s 16 notice were wholly invalid, the question arises as to Senator Johnston's power to issue an amended or a fresh notice in circumstances where Mr Tervonen would have been held in custody without the lawful authority of an existing and valid s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">To that matter I now turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">111 At no time after Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was issued was the process contemplated by s 17 of the Extradition Act followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">That is hardly surprising since, at least until the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, no-one would have considered that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">However, it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Thus, no s 16(1) notice had been given by the Attorney-General or Senator Ellison in the 45 day period following Mr Tervonen's remand under s 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Therefore, s 17(2) required that Mr Tervonen be brought before a magistrate who could exercise the power to continue his remand during a period which he or she considered in all the circumstances to be reasonable for the giving of a notice under s 16 or to order Mr Tervonen's release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">But that did not happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The consequence is that no magistrate ever exercised any power under s 17(2) as the Act required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">And s 17(3) required that if a s 16(1) notice was not given within the 45 day period, or a further extended period, under s 17(2), the magistrate must order the release of a person who was Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">112 The language in which ss 17(2) and (3) are cast is in imperative terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The object of those sections is to protect an individual who has been arrested and placed on remand in custody or on bail under s 15 pursuant to a warrant issued by a magistrate by the request of an extradition country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The purpose of the remand authorised by s 15 is to afford a limited period in which proper material can be placed before the Attorney-General so that he or she can determine whether to issue a notice under s 16(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The Parliament has prescribed substantial limitations on the ability of an extradition country or the Attorney-General to delay the taking of steps to give a notice under s 16(1), should that course be pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">113 The process contemplated under ss 12 and 15 of a remand in custody or, in special circumstances, on bail (s 15(6)), involves an interference with the liberty of an individual who may be a subject or citizen of Australia or an alien.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Executive interference with the liberty of an individual has always been jealously scrutinised by the Courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">There is a legislative intent evinced in s 17 that this should remain so for the purposes of the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Thus, if the magistrate is satisfied that a notice under s 16(1) is likely to be given within a particular period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, he or she is given authority to extend the time of the remand beyond 45 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">But, if the magistrate is not so satisfied, or if the period he or she allowed expires, the individual must be released from custody or discharged from any recognisances on which bail was granted to him or her (ss 17(2) and (3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">114 The Extradition Act , however, does not contemplate a situation such as occurred in Mr Tervonen's case, where an invalid s 16(1) notice was given within the 45 day period and there was no perceived necessity to bring Mr Tervonen before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Under the Act, his detention had become unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The essential prerequisites to authorise the continuation of Mr Tervonen's detention had not been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">First, there was no valid s 16(1) notice and secondly, there was no extension of time pursuant to s 17 under which such a notice could later have been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">115 Importantly, s 16(3) contemplates that the Attorney-General may give a notice before an individual has been remanded under s 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">So, Senator Johnston had power to give a fresh s 16(1) notice when he did, even though Mr Tervonen was not then held on remand pursuant to s 15 because any reasonable time under s 17(2) for giving a notice after 18 August 2006 had long since expired and, in any event, no attempt had been made to seek such an extension from a magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">That is, even though Mr Tervonen was not being held in custody under s 15, and his detention was unlawful, the Act did not operate to deprive Senator Johnston of the power to give a fresh s 16(1) notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">That is because the power to issue a notice under s 16(1) had not been exercised validly, and thus at all, before then: Minister for Immigration v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was affected by jurisdictional error and was '... no decision at all': Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">116 Because I am of opinion that Senator Ellison's s 16(1) notice was invalid and that Mr Tervonen's continued detention after 18 August 2006 was unlawful (there having been no application to a magistrate for an extension of the detention under s 17(2)), it is appropriate to grant a declaration to the effect that after 18 August 2006 Mr Tervonen was not on remand under s 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">His liberty was interfered with for a considerable time without lawful authority: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-582 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; cf: SZFDE v Minister for Immigration (2007) 237 ALR 64 at 70 [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">117 But, when those advising Senator Johnston appreciated that a consequence of Williams 157 FCR 286 (which was decided on 22 March 2007) may be that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly invalid, Senator Johnston should have caused Finland to be notified so that it could decide whether to seek to have a fresh warrant issued for the arrest of Mr Tervonen so that he could be brought before a magistrate under s 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Instead, Senator Johnston proceeded as if Mr Tervonen were lawfully on remand under s 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">118 The First Assistant Secretary, International Crime Corporation Division, provided a memorandum to Senator Johnston on 27 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">In the final but still partly redacted version of that memorandum which was tendered in evidence, the Minister was told that the deadline for consideration of the s 16 notice which he was to sign was 'as soon as possible' and that his office was aware of the urgency associated with the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">He was told that there was a risk that the existing s 16 notice issued may be found to be partly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">So far as appears from the unredacted portions of this memorandum, the Minister was not made aware of the possibility that the notice might be, as I have found, wholly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">119 The consequence of partial invalidity would have been that any remaining valid portions of the notice would have supported Mr Tervonen's continuing detention on remand under s 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The memorandum informed Senator Johnston that it was arguable, in light of the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, that:
 
 
 &#8226; the submission provided to Senator Ellison did not provide a sufficient description of the conduct 'constituting some of the offences for which Mr Tervonen's extradition was sought to enable the Minister to form the requisite opinion under subparagraph 16(2)(a)(ii)' (emphasis added);
 &#8226; as a result there was a risk that the existing notice might be found to be partly invalid;
 &#8226; there were also 7 additional offences referred to in pars (57) and (58) of the proposed draft notice;
 &#8226; the action required by him was to issue an amended s 16 notice; and
 &#8226; the extradition proceedings under s 19 were listed for hearing on 8 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">
 

120 Accordingly, on the evidence before me, Senator Johnston was not aware of the possibility that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly invalid and that if it were it may have affected the obligations of Finland or Senator Johnston to bring Mr Tervonen before a magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Nor does the evidence reveal which portion or portions of Senator Ellison's notice Senator Johnston was informed might be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">121 What, then, is the status of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice in those circumstances?</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">POWER OF THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CUSTOMS TO ISSUE A NOTICE UNDER S 16 OF THE EXTRADITION ACT 
 
122 It is necessary to deal with Mr Tervonen's challenge to Senator Johnston's power, as a minister not appointed as Attorney-General, to exercise the power to issue a notice conferred on the Attorney-General by s 16 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">No issue was taken as to the power of Senator Ellison to issue the first s 16 notice pursuant to administrative arrangements in place between him and the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The Hon Darryl Williams AM QC MP was appointed Attorney-General of the Commonwealth on 21 December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">His Excellency, the Governor-General, had appointed him and the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, under s 64 of the Constitution to administer the Attorney-General's Department of State and particular legislation, including the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Those ministers agreed on 18 January 2002 that extradition would be a portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">123 On 21 September 2006 her Excellency, the Administrator of the Commonwealth, made a new administrative arrangements order under which she ordered that the legislation administered by a Minister of State administering the Attorney-General's Department of State included the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Under that order, the administration of the Attorney-General's Department included administering matters arising under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">124 On 9 March 2007 his Excellency, the Governor-General pursuant to ss 64 and 65 of the Constitution , appointed Senator Johnston a member of the Federal Executive Council 'to hold the office of Minister for Justice and Customs and to administer the Attorney-General's Department'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">125 When he signed the s 16 notice, Senator Johnston was acting in a public office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Under the administrative arrangements order of 21 September 2006 and the division of portfolio responsibilities agreed between the previous Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Customs, the latter had portfolio responsibility for extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Senator Johnston's act of signing the s 16 notice is evidence of his having been appointed as a Minister of State with responsibility for administering s 16 of the Act: Cassell v The Queen [2000] HCA 8 ; (2000) 201 CLR 189 at 193-194 [17] - [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ citing R v Brewer [1942] HCA 33 ; (1942) 66 CLR 535 at 548 per Latham CJ and McTiernan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">126 The Extradition Act refers to the Attorney-General by name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">He or she is thus a 'particular minister' within the meaning of s 19A(1)(ab) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">In addition, s 19A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that where a provision of a statute refers to a particular minister, then unless the contrary intention appears, where two or more ministers administer the provision, any one of them is referred to as administering it (see: s 19A(1)(a) and (b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">127 There is no contrary intention in the Extradition Act to prevent a reference to the Attorney-General also being a reference to another minister administering, with the Attorney-General, that Act or the Attorney-General's Department of State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Section 19A(1)(a)(i) of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that where different ministers administer a provision in respect of different matters, and if two or more of those ministers administer it in respect of the relevant matter, any of the Ministers may do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">And, s 19A(1)(b) provides that if s 19A(1)(a) does not apply, and for the time being two or more ministers administer the provision, any one of those ministers may do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">128 The Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Customs were entitled to agree between themselves as to the way in which they would share the administration of the Attorney-General's Department and the Acts which the administrative arrangements order assigned to a Minister of State administering that Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Nonetheless, each Minister was appointed by the Governor-General to administer that Department and those Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Each Minister was answerable in the Parliament for the manner in which he (or she) discharged their office pursuant to s 64 of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Each Minister met the description in s 19A(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act of two ministers who administer each provision of the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Thus, a reference to Senator Johnston, as the Minister for Justice and Customs (whom the Governor-General had appointed to be a Minister administering the Attorney-General's Department and the Extradition Act ), by force of s 19A(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act was included in the references to the Attorney-General in the Extradition Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">129 The division of portfolio responsibilities between the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs had the effect of allocating responsibility for the Extradition Act to the latter Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Senator Johnston also had authority to exercise the functions and powers conferred on the Attorney-General in that Act under s 19A(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">This result is in the interest of efficient government administration: Attorney-General (Cth) v Foster [1999] FCA 81 ; (1999) 84 FCR 582 at 593 [37] , 595 [42] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Mansfield JJ; Mokbel v Attorney-General [2007] FCA 1536 at [34] ; see too at [42]-[43] per Gordon J; affirmed [2007] FCAFC 161 at [6] , per Heerey J with whom North and Jessup JJ agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">130 It follows that Senator Johnston was authorised to administer the provisions of the Extradition Act by force of s 19A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act : Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor [2001] HCA 51 ; (2001) 207 CLR 391 at 403 [17] - [18] per Gleeson CJ, 416 [67]-[68] per Gaudron J, 451-452 [182]-[187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, 497-500 [319]-[325] per Kirby J, 519 [380] per Callinan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">He had power to act as the Attorney-General for the purposes of the Extradition Act in circumstances of the present matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">WERE THERE DEFICIENCIES IN THE MATERIAL RELATING TO MR TERVONEN'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS ON WHICH SENATOR JOHNSTON'S S 16 NOTICE WAS BASED?</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
131 During the course of the hearing before me privilege was waived, in stages, on a number of different portions of the material before Senator Johnston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">As privilege was waived, a greater appreciation of what was before the Minister emerged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">First, there was a partial waiver of some of the redacted material in the briefing note and other documents which recorded Senator Johnston's decision of 30 April 2007 to issue the amended s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Secondly, Senator Johnston waived privilege that had previously been claimed over the whole of the dual criminality advice provided to him by the CDPP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Next, some further material was revealed in the decision record of 30 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Lastly, the departmental advice to Senator Johnston about the reconditions for the issue of the s 16 notice was completely revealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">132 Mr Tervonen argued that pars (24)-(52) and (57)-(58) of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice had been founded on warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">He complained that these paragraphs in the s 16 notice were deficient on two bases:
 
 
 (1) As to pars (24)-(27), (30)-(32), (34), (37)-(39), (41), (42), (44), (45), (49), (50), (57) and (58)
 Mr Tervonen said that these paragraphs, superficially, appear to relate to the material before the Minister, but the dates of the acts or omissions in that material and the notice do not relate to the dates in warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Accordingly, that disconformity, if established, renders at least those paragraphs in the s 16 notice bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">
 
 
 (2) As to pars (24)-(52), (57) and (58) 
 
 
 Mr Tervonen argued that pars 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 40, 43, 46-48, 51 and 52 as well as those in (1) above were not based on sufficient material identifying Mr Tervonen's alleged acts or omissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">
 

133 Paragraph 1 of warrant 5 gave rise to pars (24)-(29) of both s 16 notices, which were in the following terms:
 
 
 '(24) Two counts of Aggravated Forgery between 1 January 2004 and 6 May 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chaper 33, section 2 
 
 (25) One count of Registration Offence between 1 January 2004 and 6 May 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 16, section 7 
 
 (26) One count of Attempted Aggravated Fraud between 1 January 2004 and 29 June 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 36, section 2 
 
 (27) One count of Aggravated Forgery between 1 January 2004 and 29 June 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 33, section 2 
 
 (28) One count of Aggravated Fraud between 1 January 2004 and 2 August 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 36, section 2 
 
 (29) Two counts of Aggravated Forgery between 1 January 2004 and 2 August 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 33, section 2 ' 
 
 

134 For clarity and ease of reference I should again set out paragraph 1 of warrant 5 which said that Mr Tervonen was:
 
 '... suspected with probable cause of the following criminal acts: 
 
 
 
 1) Aggravated fraud, attempted aggravated fraud, five counts of aggravated forgery and two registration offences committed between 1 January and 2 August 2004 in Helsinki and in the territory of Finland.</sentence>

135 In the material before Senator Johnston, unlike that before his predecessor, warrant 5 had attached to it 10 further pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The first two of those set out what they described as 'background on case' which appeared to relate to the more extensive discussion in the succeeding pages of each of the 9 paragraphs in warrant 5.</sentence>

 MR TERVONEN'S FIRST ARGUMENT: ATTACK ON PARS (24)-(27), (30)-(32), (34), (37)-(39), (41), (42), (44), (45), (49), (50), (57) AND (58) 
 
136 To illustrate his first argument, Mr Tervonen pointed to the various counts alleged in pars (24)-(27) as occurring between 1 January 2004 and 6 May 2004 (pars (24) and (25)) or 29 June 2004 (pars (26) and (27)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">On their face those counts do not correlate to the description of the various offences in paragraph 1 of warrant 5 committed between 1 January 2004 and 2 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">However, the material attached to warrant 5 in relation to paragraph 1 identifies with precision what offences are referred to in pars (24)-(27) of the s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">For example, the two counts of aggravated forgery referred to in par (24) of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice were in respect of, first, the application for the registration of title to land submitted to the Helsinki District Court on 7 April 2004 and, secondly, the annexed sales contract dated 19 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">The count of a registration offence in par (25) was in respect of that court's giving effect on 6 May 2004 to those documents and registering Flammelle Oy as owner of the land concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The counts in pars (24)-(27) of the s 16 notice can readily be correlated to the particularised charges in the attachment forming part of warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">137 Each of the dates and acts or omissions in respect of pars (26)-(27), (30)-(32), (34), (37)-(39), (41), (42), (44), (45), (49) and (50) similarly can be correlated to the material in the request by Finland for Mr Tervonen's extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">138 The function of a notice under s 16(1) of the Act is to state that an extradition request has been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">It is possible to relate the paragraphs in Senator Johnston's s 16(1) notice to particular counts in Finland's request for Mr Tervonen's extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Doubtless, the s 16 notice could have been drafted more clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">It is not a model or indeed drafting precedent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">However, there is no uncertainty, when the material is considered as a whole, that pars (24)-(27) in Senator Johnston's s 16 notice refer to the request the subject of paragraph 1 of warrant 5 as explained in the attachment to that warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">139 I reject the first ground of invalidity put by Mr Tervonen in respect to the above paragraphs of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">I will deal separately with pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">MR TERVONEN'S SECOND ARGUMENT: ATTACK ON PARS (24)-(52), (57) AND (58) 
 
140 Mr Tervonen argued that the material provided by Finland in relation to warrant 5 did not sufficiently identify the conduct, or acts and omissions, alleged in respect of him to have done to enable the Minister to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">141 As is apparent from the extracts set out above, Mr Tervonen was not included or named as an actor in any of the description of the particular offences in paragraph 1 of warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Therefore, one must look elsewhere in the material for acts and omissions of Mr Tervonen which the Minister would have to consider if he were to form the opinion in s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">142 In order to understand the role that Mr Tervonen was said to have played, it is necessary first to read the background section in the attachment to warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">In essence, the prosecution alleged that several different applications for registration of title to real property were submitted to courts in a number of Finnish cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">The contracts for sales of the properties were alleged to have been forged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">In 7 of the 8 cases, the courts acted on the forged documents and registered transfers into the name of one Max S&ouml;derqvist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">He represented himself, falsely, as the purchaser from either Flamelle Oy (apparently a corporation) or one Esko Raappana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">143 Mr S&ouml;derqvist was alleged to have given the banks false information on his property and income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Six banks granted him loans of between 210,000 and 225,000 euros totalling 1.28 million euros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Mr Raappana withdrew most of the money paid to him either by cashing cheques or using the cheques to buy foreign currency and, in one case, gold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">The prosecution alleged that the frauds were committed in a methodical fashion and that a number of skilfully forged documents were used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">It alleged that Mr Raappana and Mr S&ouml;derqvist had no independent role in planning or committing the offences but instead had been hired to carry out those activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The only person with whom they allegedly had contact was a person called Mika Siira.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Mr Siira was alleged to have been instructed by a person or persons known only to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Mr S&ouml;derqvist and Mr Raappana had told the prosecution that the majority of the proceeds they had received were given to Mr Siira.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">The prosecution suspected that Mr Siira had passed at least a part of the proceeds on to an unnamed recipient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">The background then states:
 
 'The person claimed to be arrested, Jan Tervonen, is suspected of having been involved, as one of the central background figures, in the carrying out of the criminal activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">His identity was unknown to Raappana and S&ouml;derqvist who acted as dummies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">
 
 Jan Tervonen served a sentence of imprisonment between April and August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">In spite of this, he is suspected with probable cause of having been involved in the case at hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">Information on Tervonen's suspected involvement in the present case was gathered mainly through coercive measures related to pre-trial investigations of different cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">' 
 

144 Taken by themselves these last two quoted paragraphs are manifestly inadequate to enable anyone to draw a connection between any act or omission of Mr Tervonen and any of the criminal activity alleged in pars (24)-(29) of Senator Johnston's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">There was no explanation there of what Mr Tervonen did or omitted to do or what the basis was of the suspicion asserted against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">145 Some connection between Mr Tervonen and the activity can be seen in the further material provided by Finland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">The further material stated that on 16 November 2004 the Finnish police had conducted a search of the Helsinki apartment of Ms Satu Fallenbourg, said to be the past or present female friend of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">There they found 59,000 euros in 500 euro notes in an envelope together with a SIM card.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Ms Fallenbourg told the police that Mr Tervonen had given her the money in August 2004, telling her that 'a Swedish investor' had given it to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The Finnish police alleged that Mr Siira and Mr Tervonen were well acquainted with one another and that a search of Mr Siira's apartment in Sweden in March 2005 had located material relating to Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">A fingerprint of Mr Siira was found on one of the euro notes in the envelope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">Another note had a fingerprint of a bank employee who, on two occasions in the European summer of 2004, had given Mr Raappana 80,000 euros in 500 euro notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Each of those occasions (on which Mr Raappana received 80,000 euros) was the subject of offence 2 in warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">146 The SIM card had an SMS message related to the administrator ID and password of a webpage 'eskoraappana.com'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">The Finnish authorities said:
 
 '[t]he SMS is related to the present investigations, e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">through the contact information of the abovementioned server address given in connection with the bank frauds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">' 
 

Ms Fallenborg was said not to have known anything about the SIM card or its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">It was said that the SIM card was suspected to be connected to Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">147 The other general introductory material consisted of the following:
 
 
 &#8226; Assertions that from the account of Flamelle Oy, which was a limited company alleged to be involved in the committing of the various offences, 1,005 euros were transferred to the account of a Thai company, Little Pepper House Ltd, on 15 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Flamelle Oy was said not to have had any lawful business and was used only for committing the crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">On the same day, 996 euros were transferred from a company with Mr Raappana's name (Kiinteist&ouml;palvelu ja is&auml;nn&ouml;inti Esko Raappana Oy).</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">It was asserted that the Raappana company did not have any lawful business activity and was suspected only of being set up for the relevant crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">&#8226; In April 2004 a search warrant was executed in another criminal matter on premises said to be occupied by Mr Tervonen and members of his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">During that search Mr Tervonen and his brother, Mika, were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">The search produced a form for registering Little Pepper House Ltd in Thailand for value added tax purposes together with a blank invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">The search also located a computer which contained a telephone number for a Pekka Juhani Kossila, the signatory on the VAT form and a document entitled 'situation report'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Mika Tervonen had said that Mr Tervonen was probably the author of the 'situation report'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">That document stated, among other things that it was written 'from J's point of view' and:
 'It is possible that the construction activity in question can really get fucking big (own opinion), if 1-2 blokes from Sweden can get financing arranged for themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">' 
 
 The Finnish authorities asserted that this statement was suspected to refer to the frauds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Messrs Raappana, Siira and S&ouml;derqvist had all lived in Sweden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">&#8226; The search warrant also discovered a Little Pepper House Ltd visiting card of Urmas Murk together with a student card of that person on which was a photograph of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The Finnish authorities stated that they had received information that that Estonian identity was used in June 2003 when a person entered and left Thailand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">
 

148 The next item in the general particulars was a series of assertions concerning Yellow Light Invest Oy, namely:
 
 
 &#8226; During the execution of a search warrant in April 2004 at Mr Tervonen's home address, a computer was seized containing 'the articles of incorporation in digital form of Yellow Light Invest Oy (Max S&ouml;derqvist), a limited company that had a role in the present case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">It was alleged that that company was set up for the purpose of a series of crimes in warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">&#8226; The National Land Survey of Finland was said to have been misled by some unspecified information into granting Yellow Light Invest Oy the right to use its information system through a remote login.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">The login was used to obtain information from the system on real estate that had no mortgages, which was then used in committing the crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">&#8226; Another document on the seized computer contained: 
 
 
 
 
 (1) the name of Minna Lindholm, her date of birth and identity number together with several other names including those of persons who are said to be missing;
 (2) the following statement:
 "There [sic] some names that can be buyers or similar if the whole identity number is not required, they have been missing for over 10 years, not subject to being declared dead, they're alive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; The name of Ms Lindholm had been used without her knowledge or consent as being the auditor of Yellow Light Invest Oy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">
 

149 In addition to these matters, during the execution of a subsequent search warrant at Mr Tervonen's home in late January 2005 a metal/aluminium briefcase was discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">The briefcase was shown to Mr Raappana who said that it was the kind of briefcase he had when he went to different banks and committed the fraudulent acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">He said that the briefcase was given to him and it contained the documents he needed to take to the banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">He said that after visiting the banks, he always gave the briefcase back with all the documents and money it contained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The investigators asserted that by comparing the surveillance camera footage from the banks and pictures of the briefcase which had been seized:
 '... one can note that they are identical as to e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">the side profile and the attachment of the handle, and possibly also regarding the material and colour ' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">150 The investigators noted that when the briefcase was seized during execution of the warrant, it contained correspondence relating to Mr Tervonen and his woman friend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">They also noted that in January 2005 a telephone conversation between Mr Tervonen and his brother Mika was intercepted in which they discussed a briefcase and the previous destruction of documents it had contained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">During that conversation it was said that someone, whom the investigators identified as Ossi Tervonen, '... had wiped e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">fingerprints off the briefcase'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">151 In early August 2005 the Finnish National Bureau of Investigations searched the offices of an attorney named Hannu Kaitaluoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">Of course, he had been Mr Tervonen's lawyer, as recorded in warrants 1, 2 and 3, which were issued in August and October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">152 Some deleted files containing correspondence between him and Mr Tervonen during the period of late June and early July 2005 were able to be read on a computer used by Mr Kaitaluoma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">The investigators said that Mr Kaitaluoma and Mr Tervonen were already acquainted with each other and Mr Kaitaluoma was suspected of, among other things, aggravated money laundering in the same investigation as involved Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">In the deleted email messages Mr Tervonen referred to the then current Finnish proceedings using an alias for himself and also for other people when speaking of them concerning the offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">It is asserted that a number of the aliases referred to were of Mr Tervonen's brother, Ms Fallenborg and the leading detective, Senior Detective Superintendent Janne J&auml;rvinen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">153 The investigators noted that many parts of the correspondence had probably been deleted before the search and had not been saved onto the hard drive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">Part of the correspondence retrieved included an email referring to an illegally recorded telephone conversation between an attorney and an unidentified person, presumably Mr Tervonen, about a fictitious loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">That email said that according to Detective Superintendent J&auml;rvinen the conversation was '... an indication of having information on the real estate fraud, because according to [Detective J&auml;rvinen] it can also be called a fictitious loan'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">There was also a reference in the emails to someone (again, presumably Mr Tervonen) having collected from the National Bureau of Investigation the computer seized earlier and noting that it contained the articles of incorporation of Yellow Light Invest Oy and a memo related to the real estate fraud suspected to have been drawn up by 'the client'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">Another email referred to 2,000 euros being sent from Mr Raappana's company to the account of Little Pepper House Co Ltd in Thailand and stated that the latter company was suspected of being controlled by the brother of 'the client', presumably Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The email noted that the 2,000 euros had been sent before any fraud had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">154 Finland also provided an extract from an email from Mr Kaitaluoma in which he advised that he did not see any suspected role of Mr Tervonen's brother 'in the events'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">Another email reported on some of the evidence collected using code names together with 'the real names' of Mr S&ouml;derqvist and Mr Raappana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">The suggestion in this email was that Mr Siira was present in the bank on an occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">It noted a photograph had been taken of Mr S&ouml;derqvist being there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">The email referred to a scenario in which Mr Siira (whose code name in the email was said to be 'the carpenter') would be asked a number of times whether he was at the bank and then, when he denied this, he would be shown the photograph so that he would be implicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">155 The investigators claimed that this material:
 
 '... particularly the messages written by Jan Tervonen (using the name 'Ulf') show there is probable cause to suspect [Mr] Tervonen of offences in this series of crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Especially this information written by Tervonen:

<sentence id="s648">fingerprints) that this money has been acquired through the aggravated frauds in question.</sentence>

The 'blonde' was said to be a reference to Ms Fallenborg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">156 The CDPP's advice provided to Senator Johnston summarised the material provided by the Finnish authorities in relation to Mr Tervonen's acts and omissions in respect of warrant 5 in the following sentence:
 
 
 '89 It is alleged that [Mr] Tervonen was involved in a scheme with a number of other persons in which they hired persons by the name of S&ouml;derqvist and Raappana to make applications for loans using false documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">' 
 
 

157 The CDPP continued by summarising the nature of the eight transactions to procure and register transfers and mortgages of eight different pieces of real estate in Finland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">But he made no further mention of any act or omission of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Before discussing each of the offences in warrant 5 the CDPP continued:
 
 
 '90 The advice in relation to these offences is premised on the fact that if a Magistrate accepts that the acts and omissions are sufficient, offences would be found for dual criminality purposes based upon aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of those offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">' 
 
 
 THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE MATERIAL IN RELATION TO WARRANT 5 
 
158 The material concerning Ms Lindholm referred to above, which was found on the computer seized from Mr Tervonen's home, provided Senator Johnston with a sufficient description of Mr Tervonen's acts or omissions to support pars (51) and (52) of the s 16 notice in respect of two of the three registration offences and two of the six forgery offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Those offences related to the alleged false consent of Ms Lindholm to act and her allegedly false appointment as auditor of Yellow Light Invest Oy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">159 However, apart from those offences I am not satisfied, for the reasons below, that the material before Senator Johnston sufficiently identified conduct of Mr Tervonen on which the Minister could form the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">160 The only act or omission expressly referred to by the CDPP as alleged against Mr Tervonen was contained in the single sentence that he 'was involved in a scheme with a number of other persons'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">The CDPP's advice did not provide any detail as to how it could be found that Mr Tervonen was aware of all the material ingredients of the underlying conduct in relation to each of the balance of the offences in warrant 5 so as to attract the liability of a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of the principal offences: Giorgianni v The Queen [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">161 However, the primary material provided by Finland and provided to Senator Johnston included a number of acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen which the Finnish authorities considered gave rise to him being suspected with probable cause of having committed the offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">That material is capable of showing that Mr Tervonen had an involvement in establishing Yellow Light Invest Oy so that it could seek information through a remote login from the National Land Survey of Finland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">And, the material suggests, as I have found, that Mr Tervonen may have been involved in procuring Yellow Light Invest Oy's registration or continuing existence by falsely representing to Finnish authorities that Ms Lindholm had consented to act as and was the auditor of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">162 In addition, the document found on Mr Tervonen's computer with Yellow Light Invest Oy's articles of incorporation and Ms Lindholm's identity details included the names of some missing persons and the statement that some of those persons could be buyers provided that they had not been declared dead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">However, in contrast to the suggestion in that suspicious document, the scheme of the fraud alleged against Mr Tervonen involved Mr S&ouml;derqvist, a real person, becoming registered as the purchaser and applying for a loan in his own name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">This was a different scheme to one involving fictitious purchasers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">The only further concrete link between Mr Tervonen and any of the frauds in warrant 5 was the material seized from Ms Fallenborg's apartment, being the 59,000 euros in the envelope and the SMS card with Mr Raappana's contact details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">163 A briefcase of a similar material and colour to that used by Mr Raappana when he went to the banks was found at Mr Tervonen's home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The briefcase had personal correspondence of Mr Tervonen in it when found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">And, Mr Tervonen communicated with his lawyer, Mr Kaitaluoma, apparently using a code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">It is not clear whether there is any doctrine of legal professional privilege applicable in Finland or anything that would prevent the use of such material in Finnish proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">164 The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation asserted that Mr Kaitaluoma was suspected of aggravated money laundering in the same investigation as that in which Mr Tervonen was involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">If so this may make communications between lawyer and client to facilitate a fraud admissible ( Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500).</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">But there is nothing inherently improper or unusual in a lawyer and a client discussing material which the police have found, or say they have found, relating to possible offences in which the client may be alleged to be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">The material in the retrieved data from Mr Kaitaluoma's computer seems to fall within this category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">None of that material amounts to an admission by Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">There is, however, some connecting material in the extract from the emails on which the Finnish authorities placed reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">This material could indicate that Mr Tervonen knew that Mr Siira had been photographed in the bank when Mr S&ouml;derqvist was there and had falsely denied that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">An inference may be able to be drawn that this information was not information that ordinarily would be known to a suspect in a fraud investigation who was not in contact with or aware of the roles of the other persons involved in the fraud being investigated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Likewise, the fact that Mr Tervonen was able to say that the home page address on the SMS card was never used in the fraud may be able to be used to show a level of knowledge that could only have been gained by the person who was intimately involved in the commission of the fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">165 At the end of the day, this material fails to identify conduct, being acts or omissions, of Mr Tervonen capable of constituting or leading to an inference of an offence for the purposes of s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">The CDPP did not isolate any acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen in relation to warrant 5 and then characterise them as equivalent conduct which, had it taken place in New South Wales, would have constituted an offence there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">The Minister did not put any reasoned argument to do so during the hearing, but simply provided cross references in the material before Senator Johnston between the warrants, the materials provided by Finland and the CDPP's advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">166 I am of opinion that this material is inadequate to support a prima facie case of any contravention of a law in Australia that is equivalent to any of the Finnish offences in warrant 5 other than those in relation to Ms Lindholm to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">As the CDPP summarised, Mr Tervonen was alleged to be 'involved' in the commission of various offences as an accessory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Here, the material in support of the charges in warrant 5 contains no sufficient link to Mr Tervonen in respect of knowledge on his part of all of the essential facts which constituted each of the multiple offences: Giorgianni 156 CLR at 503, 506 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">167 There is no explanation of how Mr Tervonen, when he was in jail between April and August 2004, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the activities of any of Messrs Siira, Raappana or S&ouml;derqvist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">In order to establish Mr Tervonen's liability as a secondary offender in Australia, it was necessary for Senator Johnston to have before him identified conduct of Mr Tervonen which showed his intentional participation in each offence, with knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up that offence: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 667 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ applying Giorgianni [1985] HCA 29 ; 156 CLR 473.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">It is here that the material provided by Finland fails to provide a substantive link between the conduct alleged and how Mr Tervonen could be found to have been a secondary offender under the law of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">This deficiency in the material relied on is accentuated in respect of those offences which occurred while he was in jail between April and August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">168 For example, it is not alleged that first, Yellow Light Invest Oy made an online enquiry in relation to any of the real estate the subject of any of the charges or, secondly, that Mr Tervonen had done or omitted to do anything in relation to any such enquiry, or, thirdly, how such an enquiry was related to any of the substantive offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">There is no evidence or allegation linking Mr Tervonen to any of the forged documents in warrant 5 apart from those involving Ms Lindholm referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">169 A reasonable person in the position of the Attorney-General could not form an opinion that he or she should give a s 16(1) notice to support the extradition of a person charged as an accessory to murder, merely upon statements that the person was alleged to have been 'involved' in a conspiracy to murder, with no further detail as to that involvement other than the specifications of the acts or omissions of those who carried out the murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">170 The concrete exercise required by s 16 ( Truong 223 CLR at 142 [29]) required Senator Johnston to consider the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen before he could form any opinion about the matters in warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">Apart from the above offences in relation to Ms Lindholm, the actual conduct alleged against Mr Tervonen in the material before Senator Johnston was at too great a level of generality, or even abstraction, to enable him to form an opinion which satisfied the requirements of s 16(2)(a) of the Act and Art 7(2)(a) of the treaty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">As the Full Court pointed out in Williams 157 FCR at 297 [45], what was required was 'a statement of what is alleged to have been actually done or omitted'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">The material before Senator Johnston failed to identify what Mr Tervonen was alleged actually to have done or omitted to do in a manner which would enable the identification of any part of his conduct as amounting to an equivalent offence in New South Wales had he done or omitted to do those or some of those things in that State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">171 Moreover, Mr Tervonen was in prison between April and August 2004 when most of the offences in warrant 5 occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">The Finnish authorities simply asserted that despite that fact, he was 'suspected' of having been involved in those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">He might well have been suspected but the Act and the treaty required the basis of the suspicion, being his acts or omissions, to be specified sufficiently so that they could be seen either individually or in some combination to be enough to establish (if the allegation were proved) a criminal offence in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">Except in relation to Ms Lindholm, no act or omission of Mr Tervonen was identified by the material provided to the Attorney-General by the Finnish authorities to make good their assertion of suspicion to the level s 16(2)(a)(ii) required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">172 I have examined the material given to Senator Johnston in relation to the other paragraphs of warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">It fails to identify conduct or any acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen (other than in relation to Ms Lindholm) capable of supporting a view that any parts of his conduct would amount to an accessorial contravention of an equivalent law of New South Wales had it occurred here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">173 For these reasons I am of opinion that Senator Johnston could not have formed the opinion required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) in relation to pars (24)-(50) and the balance of pars (51) and (52), because there was no sufficient specification of the acts or omissions of Mr Tervonen necessary for that opinion to be able to be formed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">PARS (57) AND (58) OF SENATOR JOHNSTON'S NOTICE 
 
174 Senator Johnston's s 16 notice added pars (57) and (58) to what had been in Senator Ellison's notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Those additions were as follows:
 
 
 '(57) Five counts of Registration Offence on 2 August 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 16, section 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">
 
 (58) Two counts of Registration Offence on 2 June 2004, contrary to Finland's Penal Code, Chapter 16, section 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">' 
 
 

175 When Mr Tervonen was before the magistrate for the proceedings under s 19, Finland submitted that it sought extradition on only one count in respect of each of the multiple counts in pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">It is impossible to identify from the terms of Senator Johnston's notice precisely what charges he had in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">As noted above, there is no means of correlating the way in which the notice specified charges, the warrants, the CDPP's advice, or the material provided by Finland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">It requires some effort to track through these various documents to identify in general terms what Senator Johnston had in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">No explanation was provided to him by the Department about the nature of the addition other than to tell him that, after Senator Ellison's decision to give his s 16 notice, the CDPP had reconsidered the dual criminality issue and had provided further advice that it was possible to find dual criminality for the additional seven offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">176 The briefing material to the Minister stated that '[t]he additional seven offences are those referred to in paragraph 57 and 58 of the Notice at Attachment A'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">That is all the help Senator Johnston, and for that matter I, have had in identifying the source of, or conduct relied on for, the additional charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">177 In his submissions at the hearing the Minister identified the 2 charges on which Finland proceeded before the magistrate as arising out of pars 1 and 6 of warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">The charge in par 1 of warrant 5 related to the decision of the Helsinki District Court to register a transfer and mortgage on 2 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">This appears to correspond with the registration offence referred to in par (57).</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">Mr S&ouml;derqvist was alleged to have applied for a loan in June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">Initially he sought 200,000 euros, but on 6 July 2004, a bank granted a loan of 210,000 euros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">The Minister submitted that this corresponded to what the CDPP numbered as offence 9 in his advice, but in an aide memoire provided in the course of oral submissions (MFI 2) he also suggested that offences that the CDPP numbered 15, 23, 29 and 34 in his advice could be the offence on which Finland proceeded before the magistrate in par (57).</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">178 Next, the Minister submitted (in MFI 2) that Finland had proceeded before the magistrate in support of par (58) on a registration offence occurring on 2 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">That was the date that the Vantaa District Court ruled as the effective date for registration of mortgages for a loan to Mr S&ouml;derqvist of 208,200 euros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">It is significant that the conduct relating to this offence was alleged to have commenced in the beginning of May 2004 when Mr S&ouml;derqvist discussed a loan at a bank office in Helsinki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">He was alleged to have given misleading information to the bank relating to the grant of the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">He sent email messages in his name to the bank and provided a forged pay slip to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">On 14 May 2004 the bank granted Mr S&ouml;derqvist a loan of 208,200 euros for the acquisition of real estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">And, on the same occasion, at the bank a sales contract for the purchase was signed between Flamelle Oy/Raappana and Mr S&ouml;derqvist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Mr S&ouml;derqvist was alleged to have allowed the bank to obtain mortgages on the property and to register the title and that the Court, having received those applications on 2 June 2004, the next day decided that they would be effective from the date of their receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">179 All of the activity in relation to pars (57) and (58) occurred while Mr Tervonen was in prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">No explanation in the material appeared to indicate any conduct of the Finnish prisoner, Mr Tervonen, in the commission of the offences in pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">There was no further material before Senator Johnston connecting any conduct of Mr Tervonen to the conduct of Mr S&ouml;derqvist in relation to either loan set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">180 I am of opinion that it was not open to Senator Johnston to form an opinion on this material that Mr Tervonen's conduct would have constituted an extradition offence in respect of either par (57) or (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">WHAT DID SENATOR JOHNSTON DO AND DID HE HAVE POWER TO GIVE THE S 16 NOTICE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">
 
181 The purpose of Mr Tervonen's original remand, after he had been arrested under the provisional arrest warrant, was so that he could be kept in custody for such period or periods as might be necessary for, first, a notice under s 16(1) to be given by the Attorney-General, and then for proceedings to be taken relevantly, under s 19, seeking his extradition (s 15(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">182 One basis of Mr Tervonen's attack on Senator Johnston's notice was that that Minister lacked power to make it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">There were two prongs to this attack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">First, Mr Tervonen argued that two different decision-makers, Senators Ellison and Johnston, could not issue or make a single, amended, s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">Secondly, he argued that if the whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice were invalid, Senator Johnston could not 'amend' it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">183 The first argument cannot be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">The Act refers to the Attorney-General, which is a designation of the holder of an office of a Minister of State, as opposed to referring to the individual for the time being appointed to that office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">The Parliament must have contemplated that different individuals would hold the office of Attorney-General from time to time because of changes of government, resignation or ministerial reshuffling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">Administrative and practical inconvenience would flow from a construction of the Act which required only the same individual to exercise the functions of Attorney-General either in relation to s 16 or other provisions of the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Moreover, as I have held, two Ministers can administer s 16 of the Act and s 19A of the Acts Interpretation Act allows Ministers other than the Attorney-General to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">I reject this argument as unsound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">184 The second argument is more substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">The Minister argued initially that Senator Johnston's s 16 notice was a new notice and that his predecessor's one had no legal status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">But, Senator Johnston did not issue a 'new' notice, he issued, in terms, an 'amended notice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">185 Mere proof of the absence of power to make part of a notice would not necessarily result in the balance being invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">This is because s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act deems the balance to be valid unless, as Dixon J explained in Andrews v Howell 65 CLR at 281, Mr Tervonen showed that the balance was not intended to operate in the absence of the invalid portions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">186 But the problem here is different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">It is clear that Senator Johnston intended to make an amendment to the number of offences for which Mr Tervonen could be eligible for extradition to Finland by adding the 7 offences the subject of pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">However, the selective revelation of his legal advice leaves an open question as to what power Senator Johnston actually exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">I infer that Senator Johnston did not intend wholly to replace Senator Ellison's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">Had that been his intention he would have not have headed the notice as ' Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Rather he would have had to state that a new notice was being given because the old one was wholly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">That would reflect the result of the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Dutton 92 FCR at 578 [12]-[13], that once a (valid) s 16 notice has been issued, it cannot be withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">187 In these proceedings, the civil onus of proof on the balance of probabilities applies under s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">That requires the Court to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the occurrence or existence of a fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">The Court makes such a finding based on its reasonable satisfaction that the allegation has been established by the evidence, as Dixon J explained in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-363; see too Cassell 201 CLR at 193 [18] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">188 While Mr Tervonen has the onus of establishing his case, the Minister has gone into evidence by adducing part, and withholding part, of the material before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">The Minister consciously waived privilege on portions of that material on a number of occasions during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Mr Tervonen could not lead evidence of what remained in the privileged material which the Minister chose not to put before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">However, that material which the Minister did choose to put before the Court leaves uncertain whether he addressed the correct question, namely whether the whole of the material enabled him to form the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) on the paragraph in the notice, or at least so many of them as might have been valid, had he turned his mind to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">189 In Blatch v Archer (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 65, 98 ER 969 at 970 Lord Mansfield CJ observed, in a passage approved in Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ and in Vetter v Lake Macquarie CC [2001] HCA 12 ; (2001) 202 CLR 439 at 454 [36] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ with whom Hayne J generally agreed at 477 [107]:
 
 'It is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">' 
 

190 Senator Johnston was asked to issue a notice or amended notice under s 16(1) which would conduce to enabling proceedings to be taken under s 19 for the extradition of Mr Tervonen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Senator Johnston was given all the material which had been provided by Finland to the Attorney-General in support of its request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">On the evidence before me (that is, the still partly redacted briefing material given to him by the First Assistant Secretary of the International Crime Co-operation Division of the Attorney-General's Department) his attention was not directed to which part or parts of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice might have been invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">He was not asked to proceed on the basis that Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was wholly invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">That raises the question as to what Senator Johnston asked himself in forming whatever opinion he formed in relation to the s 16 notice which he signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">191 While, as I have indicated, there were serious deficiencies with respect to the material before Senator Johnston in support of warrant 5, Mr Tervonen has not impugned the adequacy of the balance of the material before Senator Johnston in relation to any of the other warrants so far as that material would support him forming the opinions required under s 16(2)(a)(ii) had Senator Johnston used all or some of that material for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">Mr Tervonen, in fact, conceded that the material before Senator Johnston was sufficient to support the formation of the opinions required under s 16(2)(a) in respect of all of the paragraphs in his notice other than pars (24)-(52) and (57)-(58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">192 The First Assistant Secretary suggested, at one point, to Senator Johnston that he issue an amended s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">The Minister was told that, having regard to the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286, the CDPP provided further advice adding an additional 7 offences set out in pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">And, the First Assistant Secretary's advice also informed Senator Johnston that he had to consider each of the offences in the draft notice and determine whether he was of the opinions in s 16(2)(a)(i) and (ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">The First Assistant Secretary's briefing note then discussed some matters covering almost a page which were redacted for reasons of legal professional privilege and continued by recommending that he:
 
 '... issue a new section 16 notice ... [redactions made] ... 
 
 
 
 &#8226; [redaction made]
 &#8226; to ensure that the additional (seven) extradition offences [redaction made] are put before the Magistrate for the purposes of his determination under section 19 Extradition Act ...' 
 
 
 

193 The Minister was then informed that the Department considered the requirements of s 16 of the Extradition Act and Article 7 of the treaty had '... been met for the offences listed in the attached fresh section 16 notice' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">194 During the hearing, the parties' arguments changed from the positions taken in written submissions because more material was revealed from portions of the briefing material given to Senator Johnston after legal professional privilege was partially waived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Ultimately, Senator Johnston's attention was directed to the CDPP's fresh advice and he was informed:
 
 'Taking into account the CDPP advice in relation to the conduct set out in the extradition request from Finland (including the supplementary documentation provided in support of the request), you may be of the opinion that if Mr Tervonen had engaged in conduct constituting the Finnish offences listed in the section 16 notice in New South Wales at the time the extradition request was received (August 2006), that conduct would have constituted extradition offences in relation to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">' 
 

195 From the above, Senator Johnston was asked to consider giving an 'amended', a 'new' and a 'fresh' notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">No distinction was drawn in the briefing material in evidence between these descriptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">The First Assistant Secretary's briefing note also drew his attention to the fact that Mr Tervonen's then grounds for his challenge to Senator Ellison's s 16 notice included a contention that the previous Minister could not have formed the requisite opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) and that matter had been listed at that time for hearing on 21 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">The notice which Senator Johnston was asked to sign, and ultimately did sign, was headed ' Amended Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">196 It is not clear from the First Assistant Secretary's briefing material whether Senator Johnston was asked to consider the whole of the material afresh for the purpose of making amendments, only some of it including that in respect of the new pars (57) and (58), or just those new paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">However, he was not told that it was possible that the whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid, and that he could issue a completely new one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">197 Where an administrative decision-maker realises that he, she or it has made a jurisdictional error in an earlier purported 'decision' so that the statutory function was never, in fact, performed, he, she or it can consider the matter afresh, unless the legislative regime prevents that occurring: Bhardwaj 209 CLR at 603-604 [5]-[8] per Gleeson CJ, 614-615 [51] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ, 619 [67] per McHugh J, 644-645 [149] per Hayne J, 649-650 [163]-[165] per Callinan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">198 Senator Johnston did not give a fresh s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">By its very terms, his was an 'Amended Notice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Thus, he may have proceeded on the basis that there was a risk some of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was invalid or affected by jurisdictional error of the kind identified in Williams 157 FCR 286.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">But there is no basis in the evidence before me to suggest that Senator Johnston approached the matter completely afresh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">I am not prepared to draw an inference that he did, on the incomplete material in evidence and the failure of the Minister to give any direct evidence of his decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">199 What task Senator Johnston did undertake?</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Did he simply consider pars (57) and (58), being the amendments to the notice?</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">Or, did he consider the whole of the notice afresh together with all of the material before him so as to come to the requisite opinion under s 16(2)(a)(i) and (ii) in respect of every single paragraph in the s 16 notice which he signed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">200 It is not uncommon when an amendment is made for the person making it to review the whole document, as amended, for the purposes of seeing that it then, as a whole, reflects that person's intentions or objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">Thus, it is conceivable that Senator Johnston read all the material and satisfied himself that it was appropriate to sign the document in its totality, rather than merely focusing on two additional paragraphs that he had been advised to add.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">The evidence before me does not disclose what portions of Senator Ellison's notice Senator Johnston was told may have been susceptible to being found to be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">It is not possible for me to assess whether Senator Johnston looked at any particular paragraphs to address that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">There is no doubt that he had all of the material before him which had been provided by Finland and was aware of the risk that some, but not all, of the earlier s 16 notice might be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">201 Senator Johnston did not give evidence as to what he took into account or what he addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">He could have done so, notwithstanding that for a Minister to give evidence would have been unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">Such evidence may have clarified what Senator Johnston did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">A busy Minister may have some difficulty, even after only one or two months, in recalling precisely what decision-making process he or she undertook in a portfolio requiring a number of individual decisions on a daily basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">I infer that Senator Johnston could not have clarified the actual question he addressed in signing the s 16 notice by any evidence he may have given: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">202 The material provided by Finland in support of its extradition request covered over 270 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">In addition to that material, the CDPP's advice was a further 22 pages long and the ministerial briefing papers comprised over 20 more pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">It is a difficult task to analyse all of that material and form a view in respect of each of the items in Senator Johnston's s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">There was no attempt in the material before the Minister to correlate paragraphs in the then draft s 16 notice with any portion of the vast amount of documentary material before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">That material can be pieced together, with considerable patience, by using the CDPP's advice, considering each individual warrant, then working out which of the charges the CDPP found could have dual criminality and what portions in the voluminous material supported them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">It is difficult to imagine that a busy Minister would have had the time to engage in such a perplexing task with such disordered material, especially when his senior advisers had recommended, and the CDPP had told him it was in order for, him to sign the amended notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">It was a task which counsel for the parties essayed, somewhat summarily, for the purposes of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">Each prepared tables referring to parts of the evidence which were said to relate to particular paragraphs in the s 16 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">But there was only brief reference in argument to the detail of the material and how it supported or failed to support each paragraph in the s 16 notice based on warrant 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">203 The Minister relied on the terms of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice and, particularly, its preface, which reads:
 
 'To a magistrate before whom the person named in this notice is brought: 
 
 I, David Albert Lloyd Johnston, Minister for Justice and Customs of the Commonwealth of Australia, under subsection 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 , state that an extradition request has been received from Finland, an extradition country, in relation to Jan Atso Tervonen for the following extradition offences: 
 ...' 

204 Because of the prescription of form 9 in the Extradition Regulations 1988 (Cth), there was no indication in that notice itself that the Minister had formed any opinion in respect of any or each of the paragraphs or only those the subject of the amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">If, for example, Senator Johnston had embarked on a process of simply determining whether the additional two paragraphs should be added to Senator Ellison's notice, he would be amending a notice that had no legal validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">On the other hand, if he were considering the whole notice afresh he would be giving a new notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">205 If Senator Johnston simply addressed the question of adding pars (57) and (58), then, for the reasons that I have given, no valid s 16 notice remains extant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">That is because the whole of Senator Ellison's notice was invalid and there was no proper basis on which Senator Johnston could have added to it pars (57) and (58) because he could not have formed the opinion required by s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">206 Senator Johnston may have addressed some unspecified paragraphs of Senator Ellison's notice, referred to in the redacted portions of the material in evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">But, because of those redactions, it is not possible to know whether Senator Johnston addressed, and made a specific decision in respect of, the portions of his s 16 notice that I have held to be invalid, or other portions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">On that state of the evidence, I am not satisfied that Senator Johnston issued any part of the s 16 notice validly, because I do not have any evidence as to the portion or portions, if any, (other than pars (57) and (58)) which he considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">207 The last alternative is that Senator Johnston considered the whole matter afresh, and that it is possible to sever the portions of the notice relating to warrant 5 which I have found to be invalid, leaving the balance of the notice intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">In Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 40-41, Mason J said:
 
 'The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB at 228.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">' 
 

208 The Minister chose to tender selected portions of the material before him, while retaining claims for legal professional privilege on other portions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">The portions on which privilege claims were maintained could have made clear the question which the Minister may have addressed having regard to the effect of the decision in Williams 157 FCR 286 in respect of some portion or portions of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice that may have been invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">However, the Minister has not proved whether he had regard afresh to any particular part or parts of Senator Ellison's notice for the purposes of overcoming any perception of invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">Accordingly, the evidence is silent on whether the Minister directed his attention to any possible problem with respect to the paragraphs in the notice he ultimately signed which replicated paragraphs in Senator Ellison's notice for which I have held there was material on which he could have formed the opinions required by s 16(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">CAN SENATOR JOHNSTON'S NOTICE BE SEVERED?</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">
 
209 Is it possible, as the Minister contended, to sever the invalid portions of Senator Johnston's s 16 notice under s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act ?</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">That provides, as explained above, that the notice is to be taken to be valid '... to the extent to which it is not in excess of ...' the power to make it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">However, Dixon J explained in the Bank Nationalisation Case 76 CLR at 371 that the statutory presumption would be displaced if rejection or severance of the invalid part would mean that the otherwise unobjectionable portion would operate differently on Mr Tervonen or in some other way produce a different result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">210 Here, Senator Johnston could have given a wholly fresh notice under s 16 in the form of the one he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">The provisions of s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act would apply to sever the portions of it relating to warrant 5 which I have found to be invalid, while leaving the balance of the notice valid and operative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">But, if in signing the notice he asked himself the wrong question (as his predecessor had recently done in Williams 157 FCR 286) or confined the formation of his opinion under s 16(2)(a)(ii) to pars (57) and (58), then the whole notice would be bad because of jurisdictional error, namely the failure to form the opinions required in accordance with s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of any paragraphs other than pars (57) and (58).</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">Nothing in s 46(2) would save it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">211 The only amendment actually made was the addition of pars (57) and (58) and I have held those to be invalid, as I have held the whole of Senator Ellison's s 16 notice to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">The Minister has put forward in submissions a variety of possible matters to which he may have directed himself, none of which identifies, beyond the intention to add pars (57) and (58), what he was actually doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">212 Senator Johnston addressed whether pars (57) and (58) should be added to the 'amended notice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">But he came to the incorrect conclusion that they should.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">I am of opinion that he did not consider the whole of the material afresh in such a way as would justify me in severing portions of the notice to preserve its validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">A considerable part of the notice could not have satisfied Senator Johnston had he correctly considered forming an opinion in accordance with s 16(2)(a)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">While s 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act enables those portions which I have found to be invalid to be severed from the notice, the material in evidence comfortably satisfies me that the Minister was not addressing himself to the correct question when considering the amended notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">As Dixon J said in Avon Downs 78 CLR at 360:
 
 'It is not necessary that you should be sure of the precise particular in which he has gone wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">It is enough that you can see that in some way he must have failed in the discharge of his exact function according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">' 
 

213 I am comfortably satisfied that on the material before me, which it was in the power of the Minister to supplement, had he chosen, by revealing in evidence the redacted portions of the material before him, Senator Johnston failed to discharge the exact function he was required to discharge in accordance with law ( Vetter 202 CLR at 454 [36]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">In those circumstances, it would be wrong to sever portions of the instrument based on mere speculation that, despite the errors I have found, and the absence of evidence of what he was told could be invalid in Senator Ellison's notice, the Minister addressed the rest of the amended s 16 notice correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">He has provided no evidence to support a finding that he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">Rather, I am of opinion that by reason of the jurisdictional and other errors in his failure to address those parts of the amended s 16 notice which I have found to be invalid, and on the evidence before me, Senator Johnston did not form the opinions required by s 16(2)(a)(ii) in respect of any paragraph in the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">CONCLUSION 
 
214 For the reasons that I have given, I am of opinion that Mr Tervonen's challenges have succeeded in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">In summary, I have formed the preliminary view that, subject to hearing the parties, I should make orders to the effect of:
 
 (a) declaring each s 16 notice invalid;
 (b) quashing each s 16 notice; 
 
 
 (c) directing the Minister to issue a notice in statutory form pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Act directing a magistrate to order the release of Mr Tervonen from custody;
 (d) requiring the Minister to pay Mr Tervonen's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">
 

215 The parties asked that I provide them with my reasons and an opportunity to address the precise form of relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">I will therefore order that the proceedings be stood over for argument on the appropriate relief to give effect to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">I certify that the preceding two hundred and fifteen (215) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.</sentence>
