1 This case concerns the financial consequences of a failed investment in what was known as the Queen Victoria Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The first plaintiff, John Tosich, was the investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Tosich was a client of the first defendant, Tasman Investment Management Limited, formerly Warne Investment Management Limited, ("Tasman Investment") that carried on business as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The second defendant, Colin Warne, was managing director of Tasman Investment and was personally involved in its dealings with Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Warne recommended the investment in the Queen Victoria Project to Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It was a failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Tosich sues Tasman Investment and Warne for his loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">All Saints Investments Pty Limited ("All Saints") claims to be an assignee of Tosich's cause of action against Tasman Investment and Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">American Home Assurance Company ("AIG") is an insurer and issued an Investment Managers Insurance Policy 85550 that Tasman Investment and Warne claim will indemnify them in relation to claims arising out of the failure of the Queen Victoria Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Aon Risk Services Australia Limited ("Aon") was an insurance broker and acted as such for Tasman Investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">If the AIG policy does not provide cover, then the defendants sue Aon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These relationships have given rise to a plethora of claims and cross-claims that need to be examined with some care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The parties have agreed on a chronology of events that fleshes out the issues to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In order to better match issues with events I have edited and split the chronology under the following headings: history related to Warne entities; Queen Victoria Project; dealings between Tosich and Warne; dealings between Warne entities and Aon; dealings between Aon and AIG; and dealings between Warne entities and AIG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The split is somewhat arbitrary and there is some overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The chronology so organised is the first schedule to this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The second schedule is a dramatis personae.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">2 The fundamental transaction was the purchase of a site of some 404 ha at Tableland Road, Wentworth Falls in the New South Wales Blue Mountains area, the registered proprietor of which was the Wentworth Area Health Service, a branch of the New South Wales Health Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was the site of the former Queen Victoria Hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The site was zoned part Bushland Conservation (No Subdivision) (Hospital), part Bushland Conservation (No Subdivision) and part Environmental Protection under the City of Blue Mountains LEP 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Longevity Management Systems Pty Ltd (LMS) was interested in acquiring the site to develop a retirement village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The project was introduced to Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">3 On 10 May 2000 Tasman Investment (by Warne) provided LMS with a written commitment to provide the funds required for acquisition of the property by 28 June 2000 based on a bid price of $1.52 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That letter was provided to the Department of Public Works --- Services, which was handling the sale on behalf of the vendor, with the bid by LMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">A further offer of $2,012,000 was made on 25 May 2000 and accepted on 29 May 2000 with settlement on or before 28 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Settlement occurred on 27 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Tasman Investment provided the funds and LMS took title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">4 So, the defendants were committed to the project on 3 June 2000 when Tosich received a letter from Warne on behalf of Tasman Investment as follows:
 
 "It is not everyday I have the opportunity to offer you a Residential Property Development Investment , to build a Retirement Village at Wentworth Falls (Blue Mountains).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 We have been researching this type of Property Development for some time and we believe it could generate returns of approximately 20% pa over a 5 year period .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 Full details of the project are enclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Please read it and arrange an appointment with Sandra, Laurie or Peter to discuss the suitability of this investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 
 A seminar will be held on Wednesday 14 th June 2000, details enclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">

 SUMMARY 
 In summary, risk can be defined as the possibility that the actual return of an investment will be different from the expected returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 Any investment in Property Development carries with it a higher than average level of risk especially where construction costs may expose the investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As a consequence, investment in Property Development should only play a role in a portfolio where risk exposure is consciously accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">(Refer risk analysis) Property Development, while carrying risk, can still be a fundamentally sound investment, provided costs are adequately controlled and confidence exists in the particular investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This project provides a unique opportunity to participate in the strongly growing aged accommodation industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 I have participated in this investment for our clients because of the significant profit potential and the very low cost of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">(approximately $10,000 per unit with a construction cost of approximately $100,000 per unit).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">If for unforeseen reasons we decided to terminate the investment and sell all units at cost I believe we should recover our capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I believe the site is quite exceptional as the mountains provide limited opportunities for this type of investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 The land will settle on 28 th June 2000, consequently funds need to be in by that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Cheques should be made payable to Longevity Management Systems Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I will be in Canada from Friday 2 nd June returning to work Tuesday 27 th June.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Please contact Laurie, Sandra or Peter in my absence to discuss this project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 We will be conducting a seminar at the Fairways Resort, Primbee on Wednesday 14 th June at 5.30pm, please call Vanessa or Genny by Tuesday 13 th June to confirm your booking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The seminar will be led by Executive Directors of Longevity Management Systems Pty Ltd Mr Peter Barnes and Mr Tim Brennan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 I am very enthusiastic about the prospects of this new project and I look forward to participating in it with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">"

<sentence id="s52">)
 

6 No significant difference in the proposal was indicated at a September meeting between Tosich and Warne where Warne continued to commend the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">As a result, Tosich invested $125,000 on or about 6 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">7 Leaving aside matters of detail (important as they may have been) and the commercial merits of the proposal, there were two fundamental problems with the proposal that were never solved --- zoning of the land and the legal structure of the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">8 The proposal was presented as a retirement village, with individual units available for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">There is no doubt that the zoning of the land did not permit that use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It is clear that there was never any chance of obtaining approval of the scheme as proposed to investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Considerable later modification of the proposal to seek to qualify as a "hospital" did not overcome the difficulties that were spelt out by the Blue Mountains City Council in its letter of 17 April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Even when radical amendments, including the removal of all independent living/low care cottages, were proposed, Council officers maintained objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The directors of Tasman Investment accepted by 13 August 2002 that the project as had been proposed to investors was not a permissible use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">9 By 22 August 2000 LMS had received advice from Chris Lonergan &amp; Associates of significant concerns as to permissibility of the development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The only valuation of the site in the possession of LMS in evidence was $500,000---$1,000,000 on an "as is" basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">At no time before the end of 2000 the defendants neither obtained an independent valuation of the property nor sighted any valuation that LMS had obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Before the end of 2000 the defendants did not obtain any independent town planning advice as to the permissibility of a retirement village on the property and did not ascertain the attitude of Blue Mountains City Council to such a development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The defendants also did not prepare any cash flow statements to ascertain whether the capital invested into the project could be returned if development approval was not granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The defendants simply accepted and passed on to Tosich what had been put by LMS without any independent verification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">10 The other problem was the inchoate basis of the investment of the funds as put forward in the Initial Offer Proposal, with no material change before the funds were paid and received in November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is simply not possible to ascertain what rights were to be acquired and from whom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">That situation was never satisfactorily resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It is not necessary to trace the tortuous path of the negotiations between the defendants and LMS as to that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM AGAINST TASMAN INVESTMENT AND WARNE (THIRD AMENDED STATEMENT OF CLAIM) 
 
11 The parties are identified and the relationship between Tasman Investment and Warne pleaded leading to a duty of care pleaded as follows:
 
 "In the premises, Warne Investments and Warne jointly and severally owed to Mr Tosich a duty of care in relation to the provision of advice as to Mr Tosich's financial affairs including, without limitation, investments suitable for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 In the premises, at all material times, Mr Tosich was a person who might reasonably have been expected to rely on any recommendation in relation to securities made by Warne Investment or Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">" 
 

12 The Initial Offer Letter and the Initial Offer Proposal are pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is then alleged that the project described was a managed investment scheme within the meaning of s 9 of the Corporations Law (as it then applied) and the project had to be registered on or before 1 July 2000 in the manner prescribed in Ch 5C of the Corporations Law as required by s 601ED of the Corporations Law and had to be operated by a responsible entity by the same time (s 601FB), but that it was neither registered nor operated by a responsible entity as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is alleged that Tasman Investment was required to provide Tosich with an offer information statement within the meaning of s 715 of the Corporations Law and lodge a copy with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), but did not do so as the Initial Offer Letter did not comply as it omitted material information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The non-compliance was materially adverse from the point of view of Tosich such that s 724(1) applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">13 It is alleged that representations were made by Tasman Investment in the Initial Offer Letter, the Initial Offer Proposal and at a meeting between Tosich and Warne in September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It is alleged that each of the representations was made in, or in connection with, a dealing in securities and/or the making of a securities recommendation within the meaning of s 851 of the Corporations Law and that certain of them were with respect to future matters within the meaning of s 765(1) of the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Reliance, by investing $125,000, is pleaded, together with related allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The misleading and deceptive nature of the various representations is pleaded and causation related to that is pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">14 Negligence consisting of breach of the duty set out in para 11 above causing loss or damage is alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Various contraventions of the Corporations Law are alleged --- breach of Ch 5C, contravention of Pt 7.11 , contravention of s 728(1) and s 851.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Damage, being the investment of $125,000 less a first and final dividend of $25,608.38, is claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">15 To summarise, Tosich relies upon a claim in negligence and upon various breaches of the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">16 All Saints pleads the acquisition of all the rights of Tosich as against the defendants by virtue of a deed of assignment dated 16 June 2005 and pleads all facts and matters pleaded by Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">17 Tasman Investment and Warne make a number of admissions in their defence to the claim but deny any liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">They also ultimately relied upon certain grounds of defence that are pleaded by Aon, it having been joined in order that those grounds be taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The first of those grounds puts in issue the enforceability of the assignment of the causes of action whilst purporting to admit the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Three points are taken:
 
(1) All Saints did not have a "genuine and substantial" or "genuine commercial interest" in the chose in action immediately prior to the time of the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">(2) The chose in action was not annexed to a right of property assigned at the same time as the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">(3) Neither the statutory causes of action nor the cause of action in tort was capable of being assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The second ground is that, for present purposes, Tosich only became a plaintiff on 18 May 2007 by which time all causes of action were statute barred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Primary liability 
 
18 Each of Tasman Investment and Warne admits owing the pleaded duty of care to Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">That was inevitable in view of the history of the relationship between Warne and Tasman Investment and Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">They do not admit breach of that duty of care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">19 The defendants admit that had they been aware in June 2000 that a retirement village was not going to be possible for the property, they would not have advised Tosich to make the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">They also admit that had they been made aware of the concerns expressed by Lonergan in August 2000, they would not have encouraged Tosich to make the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The advice given was misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The lack of proper investigation of the project prior to recommending investment to clients was a serious breach of the duty of care and skill owed by a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The commitment by Warne to LMS to provide substantial funds was undoubtedly a major factor in the imprudent advice to clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">However, I am satisfied that Warne was convinced of the merits of the proposal, and invested some of his own money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He did not consciously mislead Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Recommending and receiving an investment with no fixed and appropriate structure was also a serious breach of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">To recommend such an investment was negligent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">20 The next problem was the failure to comply with the requirements of the Corporations Law applicable at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The proposal was undoubtedly a "managed investment scheme" as defined in s 9 of the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Whilst this case has concentrated upon three investors, more than 20 investors contributed approximately $4 million in total.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Prima facie, registration was required (s 601ED(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It could not be established that all of the issues of interests did not need disclosure to investors under Pt 6D.2 when made (see s 706 and s 708).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Registration would have required the production to ASIC of documents that did not exist and a responsible entity to operate the scheme being a public company that held a dealer's licence to operate a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The responsible entity would be subject to a number of statutory obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">There was no responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">These breaches were admitted in collateral proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and formed the basis of orders made in those proceedings ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd (2004) 183 FLR 294; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd (2006) 202 FLR 343).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It follows that Tosich had none of the protections provided for by the Corporations Law flowing from registration and the existence of a responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The proposal should not have been made to Tosich (or others) at all by a responsible financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">21 In addition, the provisions relating to disclosure to investors about securities (Pt 6D.2) were ignored by the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">They required provision of an offer information statement in the circumstances of this case (s 709(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The contents of such a statement were governed by s 715 as follows:
 
 
 "(1) An offer information statement for the issue of a body's securities must: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) identify the body and the nature of the securities; and 
 (b) describe the body's business; and 
 (c) describe what the funds raised by the offers are to be used for; and 
 (d) state the nature of the risks involved in investing in the securities; and 
 (e) give details of all amounts payable in respect of the securities (including any amounts by way of fee, commission or charge); and 
 (f) state that: 
 
 
 
 (i) a copy of the statement has been lodged with ASIC; and 
 (ii) ASIC takes no responsibility for the content of the statement; and 
 
 
 
 (g) state that the statement is not a prospectus and that it has a lower level of disclosure requirements than a prospectus; and 
 (h) state that investors should obtain professional investment advice before accepting the offer; and 
 (i) include a copy of a financial report for the body; and 
 (j) include any other information that the regulations require to be included in the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">" 
 
 
 
 

22 Section 728 relevantly provides:
 
 
 " (1) Misleading or deceptive statements, omissions and new matters A person must not offer securities under a disclosure document if there is: 
 (a) a misleading or deceptive statement in: 
 
 
 (i) the disclosure document; or 
 (ii) any application form that accompanies the disclosure document; or 
 (iii) any document that contains the offer if the offer is not in the disclosure document or the application form; or 
 
 
 
 (b) an omission from the disclosure document of material required by section 710 , 711 , 712 , 713 , 714 or 715; or 
 
 
 
 (c) a new circumstance that: 
 (i) has arisen since the disclosure document was lodged; and 
 (ii) would have been required by section 710 , 711 , 712 , 713 , 714 or 715 to be included in the disclosure document if it had arisen before the disclosure document was lodged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 
 
 (2) Forecasts and other forward-looking statements A person is taken to make a misleading statement about a future matter (including the doing of, or refusing to do, an act) if they do not have reasonable grounds for making the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This subsection does not limit the meaning of a reference to a misleading statement or a statement that is misleading in a material particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">" 
 
 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">) 
 
 
 
 

23 It is clear enough that the proposal circulated by the defendants was seriously deficient compared with a proper offer information statement and was misleading or deceptive in a number of respects, although, as I have said, that was not deliberate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">24 I am satisfied that all of the pleaded statutory contraventions are established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">I am satisfied that there is a remedy sounding in damages for the contraventions save for the failure to register the scheme pursuant to Ch 5C and the failure to have the scheme operated by a responsible entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Those contraventions are relevant to the claim in negligence, but I cannot find a basis for a direct claim for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">25 There can be no doubt that there was a causal connection between the negligence and each of the identified statutory breaches, and the loss making investment by Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Each cause of action is established against Tasman Investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">There is no doubt about Warne's personal liability for all causes of action so established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He was the moving force for Tasman Investments in all respects relevant to the investment in the Queen Victoria Project and is responsible for all acts and omissions giving rise to the liability of the company ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Assignment 
 
26 The deed of assignment was executed on 16 June 2005 between Tosich as assignor and All Saints as assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">At that time this proceeding was on foot, and a receiver had been appointed to the Queen Victoria Project by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceedings brought by ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The substantive operative provisions of the deed were as follows:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The assignee will pay to the assignors by bank or trust account cheque the sum of One-Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) on the exchange of this Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The assignors hereby transfer set-over and assign to the assignee absolutely all of their right, title and interest both at law and in equity in:- 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the investment in their names in the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital A; 
 (b) all rights to receive any dividend or other monies from or by virtue of the receivership of the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital C; 
 (c) all claims demands causes of action and rights of action maintainable by the assignors or either of them arising out of or connected with the facts matters and circumstances referred to in the statement of claim filed in the Tosich proceedings;" 
 
 
 
 

27 There are other features of the deed to note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The first is that the defendants Tasman Investment and Warne were each party to the deed and gave joint and several warranties as to the financial position of the assignee and Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">They also (together with the assignee) indemnified the assignors against future legal costs and expenses in the proceeding, and covenant that they will not seek costs or expenses from the assignors in relation to this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Then there are clauses dealing with later recovery as follows:

28 Aon directly challenges the effectiveness of the assignment and AIG takes the point indirectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It is submitted that each of the causes of actions is personal to Tosich (and any other like investor) and is not capable of assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The plaintiffs submit that each cause of action is incidental to a property right viz the interest in the project and also that there was a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim by All Saints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">29 This area of the law is controversial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Choses in action in general are assignable (eg s 12 Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">However, a bare right to litigate requires special consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Although maintenance was referred to in this context, no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993 (NSW) (cf Campbell J in Mid-City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi-Anarak (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [194]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In 1953 the High Court, in Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, in relation to a claim in conversion, baldly said:
 
 "... according to well-established principle, the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">
 

Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 702C:
 
 "Though in general choses in action were assignable, yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character, such as claims for defamation or personal injury, were incapable of assignment..." 
 

30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation --- or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394---395).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly 158 FCR 444 at [79]---[81]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule --- whether the assignee has a "genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a "genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another" (per Lord Roskill at 703D).</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">32 There have been varied opinions as to whether that basis can be applied by Australian courts without the High Court qualifying Poulton 89 CLR 540.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">As it happens, most negative opinions have been expressed by judges of this Court, eg Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 814 ; National Mutual Property Services (Aust) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 4) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62 ; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1413 ; (2003) 134 FCR 474 ; and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">A number of those and other authorities are analysed by McDougall J, who took the wider view, in Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68]---[82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258]---[261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">34 Did All Saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of Tosich's claim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">There is no direct evidence concerning the position of All Saints prior to the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The inescapable inference from all the circumstances, including the structure of the transaction, is that All Saints was under the control of the Warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In particular, it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising Tosich's risk as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their cross-claims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">That would remove the kind of problem exemplified by CGU Insurance Ltd v AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 36 ; (2007) 237 ALR 420 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1551 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 609.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Indeed, as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">All Saints could not profit from the arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">It is not "trafficking" in causes of actions in any real sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Facilitation of cross-claims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">However, it seems to me that the dicta in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to, or regardless of, the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In view of the controversy surrounding the topic, an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">35 What, then, of the connection with property?</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Austin J found that there were property interests created by the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action, including the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In one sense, there is a clear connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The intention is to recover the loss of property invested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">However, the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction --- it is to recover the loss by way of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In my opinion, that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action, assuming, as I do, that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">36 In the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The Third Amended Originating Process claims, inter alia:
 
 "Orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the Plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the Queen Victoria Project by the First Plaintiff and interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">" 
 

The Third Amended Statement of Claim does not include pleading to support that claim and no amendment has been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Such a claim can be ignored for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">37 The statutory claims remain to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Counsel for the plaintiffs ultimately conceded that he could find no support for assignability of these causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">That relieves me from deciding the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I should say that the concession would follow, directly or indirectly, from a long line of authority in this Court that is against assignment of a claim for damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) commencing with Park v Allied Mortgages Corp Ltd (1993) ATPR (Digest) 46-105.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Those cases were recently reviewed and followed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [50] ---[58] in relation to claims made pursuant to s 82 for breaches of s 52 and s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">38 It follows that the purported assignment of each cause of action is ineffective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">I should add that if the assignment is ineffective, it is so for all purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It follows that Tosich retains the causes of action regardless of the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">That transaction has no relevant impact upon his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">There is no evidence as to the arrangements between Tosich and All Saints in the eventuality of the assignment being ineffective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Such evidence would be as irrelevant to this case as would any other side arrangements between parties such as insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Limitation 
 
39 Aon directly pleads limitation defences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The defendants adopt a "coat-tails" approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Aon has taken the running on the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The starting point is that Tosich was reintroduced to the proceeding as a plaintiff by amendment on 18 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The next step is that 18 May 2007 is taken to be the date of the commencement of the proceeding by Tosich by virtue of O 6 r 11(3) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is then contended that all relevant causes of action accrued on or about 6 November 2000 when the money was paid by Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The last step is that each cause of action is barred, either by particular limitations in the Corporations Law or by the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), applicable by virtue of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">There is little to recommend such a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">It would be a triumph of form over substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Tosich commenced the proceeding on 27 November 2003, well within all potential limitation periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">All Saints was substituted for Tosich as plaintiff by order of the Court on 19 April 2006 claiming to be an assignee of the Tosich causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The substantive causes of action remained the same at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Thus, the defendants faced the same causes of action at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The cross-defendants faced the same cross-claims at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">However, lack of merit alone is not an answer to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">40 The first two steps are common to all causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">There has been much debate about amendment and limitation since Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Many of the authorities were considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal, presided over by Gleeson CJ, in relation to a rule similar to O 6 r 11(3) in Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710, particularly concerning the relationship between that rule and the New South Wales equivalent of the present O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In this Court, see eg Zoneff v Elcom Credit Union Ltd [1990] ATPR 41-058 at 51,746---51,747.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The introduction of s 59(2B) to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in 1994 and the consequent amendments to O 13 r 2 changed the landscape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Here, no argument was directed to those changes and their significance and, in particular, as to the interplay between O 6 r 11 and O 13 r 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">There was no discussion of the power to dispense with the Rules (O 1 r 8) (cf Karam v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2000] NSWSC 596 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 545).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">41 However, even if O 6 r 11(3) alone is considered and operates according to its terms, there is a real issue in this case as to the last step --- the effect of the limitation provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In Martinus v Kidd [1982] HCA 64 ; (1982) 150 CLR 648 it was pointed out that no new cause of action comes into being against the personal representative of a deceased tortfeasor --- the existing cause of action survives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">In that case, time runs for limitation purposes from accrual of the cause of action against the deceased (see per Gibbs CJ, Murphy and Wilson JJ at 652; Mason J at 659).</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The same principle must be applicable in relation to a cause of action that survives for the benefit of the personal representation of the deceased estate, absent any special provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">That principle applies to an action by a trustee in bankruptcy to enforce a liability of the bankrupt ( Re Mansell; Ex parte Norton (1892) 66 LT 245).</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The same principle should apply in the case of the assignment of a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The original cause of action remains the foundation of the action (although not directly applicable, see " The Jordan Nicolov" [1990] 2 Lloyds Reps 11 per Hobhouse J at 19; Lefevre v White [1990] 1 Lloyd's Reps 569 per Popplewell J at 577 citing Post Office v Norwich Fire Insurance Ltd [1967] 2 QB 363 per Lord Denning at 373; cf per Jacobs J in Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603 at 605; (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 207 at 209.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In the present case, the same causes of action have been pursued at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">42 All of the limitation provisions relied upon by way of defence, with one exception, speak in terms of causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The exception is s 1317K of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which provides for a limit of six years "after the contravention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The institution of a proceeding for a compensation order (as in this case) satisfies the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">As I have said, commencement of this proceeding was well within all time limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It is thus unnecessary to consider the vexed question as to when the various causes of action accrued for limitation purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">THE CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST AIG 
 
43 This claim is made pursuant to policy number 85550 being styled an Investment Managers Insurance Policy in respect of the period 31 October 2001 to 31 October 2002 issued by AIG to Tasman Capital Group Ltd (Tasman Capital).</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Tasman Investment was deemed an "insured entity" under the Policy pursuant to an endorsement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Warne claims to be an insured by reason of being an "Individual Insured".</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The cross-claim is for indemnity in relation to the claims by Tosich and All Saints and two other investors whose claims had been paid out --- Kotwal and Roach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">44 AIG denies that the policy responds to the claims; denies that there was a valid notification of any circumstance or of the claim as required; raises estoppels leading to rectification; relies upon certain exclusions and non-disclosure; and says that the cross-claimants settled certain claims other than that by Tosich contrary to the terms of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">AIG now accepts that the Tosich claim was made and notified during the period of insurance as required.</sentence>

<sentence id="s298">--- Macquarie Underwriting --- Expires 31.3.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">" 
 

50 AIG contends that the policy does not cover advice regarding investments other than Securities as defined, those being limited to securities of the "Insured Entity" being Tasman Capital Limited (and subsidiaries) and the Wollongong Prime Property Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The defendants contend that this construction is too restrictive and would deny commercial efficacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">It is submitted that construing the clause "contra proferentem" the words "of the Insured Entity" in the definition of "Securities" governs either "debt security" only or, at most, "share or other equity or debt security".</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">It is submitted that if "Securities" had to be of the Insured Entity, that would be inconsistent with Investment Advisory Services "including" (but not being limited to) "in connection with interests in the Fund of the Insured Entity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">51 In my opinion, AIG's construction of "Securities" is clearly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It reflects the ordinary meaning of the language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Furthermore, it is consistent with the policy being an Investment Manager Policy and with the emphasis in the Proposal upon the insured as a fund manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">52 However, some issues of construction of the phrase "Investment Advisory Services" remain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">That definition is not easy to construe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">For example, it is not at all clear whether rendering investment management services is deemed to be an advisory service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The two concepts would not normally be regarded in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">It is not clear to what the phrase "including in connection with interests in the Fund of the Insured Entity" relates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">In my opinion, the better view is they are limited to "Securities" as defined but that rendering investment management services is a distinct activity, not limited to (but including) in connection with interests in the Fund of the Insured Entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">This is consistent with the core activity being the rendering of such services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">However, the cover does not relate to those services as such, but to financial, economic or investment advisory services regarding those services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">"Investment management services" are not defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Can the services provided by Tasman Investment to Tosich be described as the management of investments and, if so, was the advice given regarding that management included in "Investment Advisory Services" within the meaning of the policy?</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">In my opinion, this is stretching the clause too far.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">53 However, in any event, the services in question were not provided pursuant to a written contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">There is no evidence of any document in the nature of a retainer, formal or informal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Written advice was tendered from time to time, but that is not what was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Exclusion 
 
54 Endorsement No 4 to the policy is another problem for the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It provides that the insurer is not liable for payment of loss in connection with a claim "arising out of, based on or attributable to" any Wrongful Act committed or alleged to have been committed prior to 31 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It is submitted that the payment of $125,000 by Tosich and the consequent losses arose out of, were based upon and were attributable to the misleading representations contained in the Initial Offer Letter and Initial Offer Proposal made on or about 3 June 2000 and made at the meeting in September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Those representations constituted Wrongful Acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">On the other hand, counsel for the defendants submits that the receipt of the money on or about 6 November and the payment over to LMS was the ultimate, and relevant, Wrongful Act, and so not excluded from cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">55 In my opinion, the loss and the claim did arise out of the June and September misleading representations and so fall within (a) of the definition of Wrongful Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The connection is not broken by the receipt and payment of the money, whether or not that constituted a separate Wrongful Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">No claim can be made pursuant to Insuring Clause A by either defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Insuring Clause B 
 
56 Insuring Clause B is as follows:
 
 "INSURING CLAUSE B --- DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY 
 The Insurer shall pay on behalf of each Individual Insured , or the Insured Entity when it is legally required or permitted to indemnify the Individual Insured , all Loss of the Individual Insured resulting from any Claim first made against the Individual Insured during the Period of Insurance for any Wrongful Act in the Insured's capacity as an Individual Insured .</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">" 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">)
 

57 The definition of "Individual Insured" will be recalled:
 
 'Individual Insured' means a natural person who is a past, present or future Director , Officer , partner or trustee of the Insured Entity and any member of a Compliance Committee established for the purposes of Chapter 5C of the Australian Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">
 
 'Individual Insured' shall also mean any Employee of the Insured Entity with respect to Insuring Clause A, and any Employee in a managerial or supervisory capacity with respect to Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Furthermore, Individual Insured with respect to Insuring Clause B does not include any externally appointed officers, such as receivers, managers, liquidators, administrators, mortgagees, in possession and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">" 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">)
 

58 "Director or Officer" means:
 
 "any natural person duly appointed or elected as a director, secretary or executive officer of the Insured Entity .</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">)
 

59 "Employee" relevantly means:
 
 "any natural person employed by the Insured Entity in the ordinary course of the business of the Insured Entity and whom the Insured Entity compensates by way of salary or wages and has the right to govern and direct the performance of that person's duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Employee shall also include an Individual Insured while performing acts coming within the scope of the regular duties of an Employee .</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">" 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">)
 

60 AIG raises a threshold issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">It contends that Insuring Clause B only covers a claim against the director or officer personally for default in that capacity, rather than a claim based upon conduct for which the corporate insured is liable vicariously or as principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">It contends that the latter is covered by Insuring Clause A rather than B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">No doubt the former is covered by Insuring Clause B, but it is not so clear that it is all that is covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">61 Some assistance might be obtained from considering those provisions that distinguish between the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">One is the definition of "Individual Insured".</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Any employee is covered with respect to Insuring Clause A and any employee in a managerial or supervisory capacity with respect to Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">That gives some support to AIG's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Another, the clause concerning Retention, is of no particular significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Endorsement 3 applies only in respect of Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It excludes liability for claims by past or present shareholders controlling 15% or more of the voting rights of the insured corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">This supports the view that Insuring Clause B relates to those duties or liabilities imposed upon a director or senior officer as such, rather than all conduct in the course of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Endorsement 5 is significant, but the rationale for distinguishing between Insuring Clause A and Insuring Clause B in relation to this exclusion is not immediately obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">The effect of the clause is that individual duties and responsibilities as a director or senior officer in relation to fundraising are not covered, but that actions carried out on behalf of the insured are covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">This gives some support to the contention of AIG as to scope of Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">All in all, the contentions of AIG as to the scope of Insuring Clause B should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">62 Thus, it becomes necessary to examine whether any of the causes of action against Warne would fall into that category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">All of the causes of action that flow from the direct dealings between Warne and Tosich --- whether in person or by correspondence --- fall within Insuring Clause A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">They do not depend upon his position as a director or senior manager as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">A claim concerning the failure to register the scheme and all that flowed from that failure would fall within Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">If there is such a duty it would be on the basis of Warne's personal liability because of his office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">That would involve some but not all of the statutory breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">However, Endorsement 5 would exclude cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In my opinion, Warne was engaged in the raising of capital by equity, debt or other means, and the liability would arise out of, or be in connection with, that endeavour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Warne cannot rely upon Insuring Clause B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">63 It is now accepted by the defendants that the claim for cover in respect of Kotwal and Roach cannot succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">64 As all claims for cover fail, it is not necessary to consider the estoppel and rectification claims by AIG or the issue of non-disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">CROSS CLAIM AGAINST AON 
 
65 The gist of the cross-claim is that Aon breached its retainer as broker in not taking all reasonable steps to procure cover for Tasman Investment against liabilities incurred as a financial planner and investment adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The claim covers the liability to Tosich and to other investors, namely John and Denise Roach and Archana Kotwal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">The first issue for determination, in view of my previous findings, is whether Aon was in breach of duty to Tasman Investments in connection with the failure to procure Professional Indemnity (PI) insurance for it to take effect after 31 March 2002 when the cover by Macquarie Underwriting expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">66 The issue relates to the nature of PI insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">That form of insurance is generally (as here) offered on a "claims made" basis, ie for claims made upon the insured in the current period of insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Such insurance is usually offered on an annual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">A claims made policy may or may not respond to claims arising out of circumstances occurring before the year of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Furthermore, if circumstances that may give rise to a claim are known to the insured prior to the relevant period, they must be disclosed to the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">This may cause the insurer to decline to review cover, or to exclude the risk that is disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The Australian Law Reform Commission discussed some of the ramifications of this structure in Report No 20 on Insurance Contracts, eg para 47 and para 265.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Section 40 and s 58 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) are a partial response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">(See, generally, Derrington D, Ashton RS, The Law of Liability Insurance, 2 nd ed, LexisNexis, Australia, 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">)
 
67 Aon was an insurance broker with a substantial business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">It had dealt with the Warne companies since early 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Mr Schuyler Elia was the employee who usually dealt with the Warne companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">68 The claim in this case was made on behalf of Tosich on or about 10 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Leaving aside the AIG policy, the only PI policy in force in relation to the Warne companies in December 2002 was the policy with Dexta Corporation entered into in April 2002 through Aon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">That policy did not cover Tasman Investment at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">By then Tasman Investment was not engaged in financial planning and advisory services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">It had been covered by a PI policy with Macquarie Underwriting, taken out effective from 30 June 2000 to 31 March 2001, and renewed for another year, expiring on 31 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">As that was a claims made policy, it did not respond to the claims made after the expiry of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Thus, Tasman Underwriting had no "run off" or retrospective insurance in relation to the financial planning and advisory business it had carried on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">That is the cause of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">It is contended by the defendants that Aon should not have caused or permitted that to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">69 On 5 March 2002 Tasman Capital Limited sent to Aon (per Mr Schuyler Elia) completed proposal forms for PI insurance for it and its subsidiaries with Macquarie Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">This amounted in substance to a proposal to renew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Tasman Investment was named as an insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Although financial planning was stated as an activity of the group, the details described Tasman Investment Management Ltd only as the responsible entity of Wollongong Prime Project Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">A financial planner's addendum was forwarded on 13 March 2002 on behalf of Tasman Capital Ltd and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Tasman Financial Planning Pty Ltd was identified as the company through which insurance agent agreements are held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">70 Aon, by Elena Kazakova, described as an account broker and one of a service team consisting of herself, Schuyler Elia and Nerida Wallace, sought clarification of some issues arising out of the proposal for renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">One question was:
 
 "Tasman Investment Management Limited ('Warne') can still be named as an Insured under any new policy, however, they will not be covered for conducting a managed Property Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Please advise what you require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">" 
 

The answer, provided by Mr Brian Johnson, was 
 
 "Suggest you talk to Schyuler about whether or not we need this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">If there is no extra cost I suggest we include them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">" 
 

There is no evidence as to whether this request was followed up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">71 In the meantime, Aon, by Elena Kazakova, obtained a quote for PI insurance from AIG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">The "non-binding indication" covered breaches as a licensed security dealer only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">The principal terms of what were described as option one were:
 
&#8226; a limit of $2 million on any one claim and in the aggregate;
 
&#8226; a retention (excess) of $50,000 inclusive of costs for each and every claim;
 
&#8226; a premium of $25,000 plus GST and stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">The proposed retroactive date was "Policy Inception".</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">No option two was included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">72 On 27 March 2002 Dexta Corporation Ltd responded to Schuyler Elia with a non-binding indication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">The insured were Tasman Capital Ltd and Tasman Financial Planning Pty Ltd and the business was described as "Financial Planner".</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">As clarified later, the basis was for a limit of $1 million and $3 million aggregate and an excess of $20,000, a premium of $23,800 plus GST and stamp duty was quoted, alternatively, for a limit of $2 million and $6 million aggregate and an excess of $20,000, a premium of $30,950 plus GST and stamp duty was quoted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The terms included:
 
 " 2) Financial Relationship Endorsement 
 There is no indemnity under this Policy for any Claim made against You: 
 
 
 (a) by any person advised or induced by You or Your employees to invest or lend money to You or any firm or corporation operated or controlled by You or by any of Your employees nominees or trustees and in which You or any member of Your family has a direct or indirect financial interest; 
 (b) arising out of the provision by You of any advice, inducement, recommendation, endorsement or opinion regarding the investment of interest, capital or personal endeavour in an investment facility or service in which You or any member of Your family has a direct or indirect control or financial interest.</sentence>

 9) Amended continuity clause 
 Clause 1.8 of this policy is deleted in full and replaced by the following:

 Notwithstanding exclusion 3.7 (prior Claims or circumstances), and in the absence of fraudulent non-disclosure by You, We agree to extend indemnity under insuring clauses 1.1 and 1.2 to any Claim arising from or attributable to or in consequence of any fact or circumstance which could have been, but which was not, notified under a previous professional indemnity insurance policy ('Previous Policy') PROVIDED THAT: 
 
 
 (a) if the fact or circumstance had been notified under the Previous Policy, You would have been entitled to indemnity under the Previous Policy; 
 (b) apart from Our right to refuse indemnity due to: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Your failure to disclose the fact or circumstance to Us before this Policy was entered into; or 
 (ii) the application of exclusion 3.7 (prior Claims or circumstances); 
 You are entitled to indemnity under this Policy; and

73 On 3 April 2002 Schuyler Elia of Aon reported to Johnson advising that Macquarie had requested further information and that he had asked for an indicative quotation based on the information on file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">The report included:
 
 "I must apologise for the inconvenience this has caused with Elena not aware of your other insurance in place with AIG ..." 
 

The report summarised the key elements of the AIG and Dexta quotes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">AIG was recommended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Neither the analysis nor the recommendation discusses the question of "run off" cover for the financial planning activities of Tasman Investment, although reference was made to "additional reinstatement of the sum insured".</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">74 Johnson favoured the second Dexta alternative, but elected to wait for a response from Macquarie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">After several prompts from Johnson to Aon with no response, on 17 April 2002 Johnson instructed Elia to proceed with Dexta Option 2, confirmed by email on 18 April 2002 at 9.31 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">At 12.29 pm on that day, Elia sent an email to Johnson reporting that Macquarie had quoted $2 million on one claim with $6 million aggregate, with a deductible of $20,000 each and every claim with a premium of $65,000 before charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">He recommended Dexta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The reasons did not include any reference to the position of Tasman Investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">75 Dexta required further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Johnson forwarded that information, signed by Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">It included the material earlier provided for the Macquarie renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The insured were identified as Tasman Capital Ltd and Tasman Financial Planning Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The policy issued in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">76 In my opinion, Aon was clearly in breach of its duty to the defendants to exercise due care and skill in arranging insurance cover in not drawing to the attention of Johnson the need for cover for the previous financial planning and advisory activities by Tasman Investment, including the officers of Tasman Investment, having in mind the rearrangement of corporate responsibilities within the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Aon, by Elia, had been closely involved in the details of professional indemnity cover for the group since May 2000, and was well aware of the details of the corporate rearrangement of responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Aon was involved in effecting PI insurance for all entities in the group, including directors' and officers' cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">It had effected the cover with AIG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The lack of "run off" cover for the prior financial planning and advisory services of the group was a critical feature of the insurance rearrangements and very material to decision making as to that cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">However, there is no evidence of the issue having been raised by anybody on behalf of Aon at any time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Neither Warne nor Johnson was cross-examined to suggest that they had been given any advice by Aon concerning the run off of liabilities of Tasman Investment or, indeed, that there was any discussion by anyone on behalf of Aon about that factor to be taken into account when making a decision about PI insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">There was no cross-examination of Johnson to suggest that the query concerning Tasman Investment being a party, the subject of the correspondence, was discussed by any officer of Aon with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">What is more, no explanation for the omission has been given by those involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Indeed, those involved for Aon, particularly Elia and Kazakova, were not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">77 Counsel for AON cross-examined Warne and Johnson to suggest that a conscious choice was made to exclude Tasman Investments from PI insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">He submitted that Aon's role was limited to executing specific instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">He also pointed to the absence of evidence from Blackett, who had a role in relation to effecting insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">There were unsatisfactory features of the evidence of Warne and Johnson, principally because of their attempts to bolster the case against AIG on the Investment Managers Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">However, the decision making by Warne and Johnson took place without any attention paid to the "run off" of the group's financial planning and advisory services preceding the change of role of Tasman Investment within the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Blackett's absence is of no significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">Aon has not led any evidence of any relevant communication with Blackett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">There is no suggestion that Blackett was aware of the "run off" problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">He was not a decision maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Johnson gave evidence that, had he been aware at the time of renewing PI insurance after 31 March 2002 that Tasman Investment would be exposed for its past financial planning activities and investment advice, he would have addressed with Aon what needed to be done to protect Tasman Investment against that risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">I accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Commercial reality compels the conclusion that, if Warne and Johnson had been made aware of the problem, they would have paid attention to the solution of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Warne, in particular, had potential personal liability and a considerable stake in the fortunes of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">I do not accept that a conscious choice was made to exclude cover for the run off of financial planning liability or that Aon's role, as broker, was restricted to merely executing instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">78 The unexplained omission by Aon to draw the attention of the client to such an important consequence of the overall insurance arrangements that were in contemplation was a breach of the duty of Aon to exercise care and skill in carrying out its role as broker ( Caldwell v JA Neilson Investments Pty Ltd (2007) 14 ANZ Ins Cas 61-724; [2007] NSWCA 3 ; per Ipp JA at [103]---[104]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">No expert evidence is necessary to come to that conclusion (cf Geoffrey W Hill &amp; Associates (Insurance Brokers) Pty Ltd v Squash Centre (Allawah North) Pty Ltd (1990) 6 ANZ Ins Cas 61-012 per Kirby P at 76768).</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">79 The next question is what loss flowed from the breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The role of damages in a case such as the present is to place the wronged party in the position it would have been in if there had been no breach of duty, ie if correct and timely advice had been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The defendants lost the benefit of that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">They were never in the position of having the advantage of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">That much is clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">That amounts to a loss caused by the breach sufficient to complete the cause of action (if it is viewed as tort) ( Poseidon Ltd &amp; Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL (1994) 179 CLR 332 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 355 and Brennan J at 362 and 368).</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">80 Quantification of damages is a different matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">It has been said that the defendants have to establish that, absent the breach of duty, relevant cover would have been obtained, eg Ferrcom Pty Ltd v Inbush (NSW) Pty Ltd (1997) 9 ANZ Ins Cas 61-339 per Cole JA at 76732.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">That is so if full indemnity is to be awarded, cf Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The position is different if less than full indemnity is considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Reconstruction of what would have occurred if the correct advice had been given involves a hypothetical set of past circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">As explained in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; (1990) 169 CLR 638 , particularly per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 639---640 and Deane, Gaudron, McHugh JJ at 642---643, this is not decided as if it were an assessment on the balance of probabilities as to whether an event did or did not happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Furthermore, in considering this case, it is to be borne in mind that Aon prevented the posited situation occurring and that it, not the defendants, was the expert in the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">See, generally, Cee Bee Marine Ltd v Lombard Insurance Co Ltd [1990] 2 NZLR 1 at 5---6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">The reconstruction of events in this case does not depend upon what the defendants would have done in a particular situation in the sense discussed by Buchanan JA in Crown Insurance Services Pty Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (2005) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-659 at [9]---[14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">It principally (but not entirely) depends upon the assessment as to what others would have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">It is to be noted that the discussion of this question by Ashley J in TBI Pty Ltd v Aon Financial Planning Ltd (2004) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-601 at [213]---[218] was tentative obiter dicta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">81 The defendants relied upon the evidence concerning Macquarie Underwriting to support the availability of appropriate insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">That company had been the underwriter for the financial planning and investment advice activities of the group for 2000---2001 and 2001---2002 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The renewal for 2001---2002 on 3 August 2001 was on the basis that the policy was unlimited as to retroactive date of the circumstances giving rise to the claim without any express exclusion of known claims and/or circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The policy when first issued had an unlimited retroactive date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The communication from Stuart Coleman of Macquarie Underwriting to Elena Kazakova of Aon on 15 March 2002 indicated that Tasman Investment could be named as an insured, however, it would not be covered for conducting a managed property trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">It will be recalled that Johnson's response was to suggest Elena Kazakova talk to Schuyler Elia about whether it was necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">There is no indication that the policy would not be framed as to the retroactive date in accordance with the then current policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The only material given by Aon to Johnson at that time made no reference to retroactive cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">82 An unidentified handwritten note on a Macquarie Underwriting communication with the initials SE (no doubt Schuyler Elia) and dated 18 April 2002 says:
 
 "MACQ --- S.C. -&gt; $62,000 --- (new bus premium) --- retro inception" 
 

That note requires explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">The absence of evidence from either Elia or Kazakova from Aon is significant on this aspect, particularly as there is no evidence from Macquarie that proves or explains a change in its attitude to retroactive cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">83 It was submitted for Aon that Johnson had rejected Macquarie's quote out of hand because of cost and it might therefore be put to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">There was no explanation of the Macquarie quote by Aon in the context of the "run off" problem and it was never considered by Johnson or Warne in that context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">I am satisfied that disclosure of that factor would have compelled close consideration of the Macquarie quote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">84 Aon called evidence from two underwriters as to PI insurance, principally in relation to non-disclosure, but some of that evidence was relevant to the instant issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">One common factor was the impact of the collapse of HIH and its withdrawal from the PI insurance market for financial planners by March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Up until then, it had been the dominant local underwriter in the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It had a large market share and offered low premium rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">It is interesting in this connection to note that Macquarie Underwriting's original quote in 2000 for the Warne companies was less in premium and deductible than HIH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The principal competition was from two agents for Lloyd's syndicates, one of which was Markel Australia and the other Resource Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">By March 2001 Resource Underwriting was reducing its exposure to the Australian market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">As a result, it was said that a sellers market developed in PI insurance, including that for financial planners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Markel Australia declined many financial planning PI proposals in 2001 and 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Markel Australia was not approached by Aon in respect of Tasman Investment or the Warne group in March/April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">85 Ian Williams, an underwriter from QBE, was called by Aon to give evidence of guidelines prepared by QBE in 2001---2002 concerning PI cover for financial planners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">It is not clear when they actually came into force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Those guidelines are silent as to both renewals and run off cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">QBE had formerly provided professional indemnity cover to the Warne group that was cancelled in July 2000 after the Macquarie Underwriting quote had been accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The nature of that cover was not explored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">There is no evidence that Aon approached QBE for PI cover in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">It can be deduced from the cross-examination of the witness upon particular files that QBE provided cover retroactive to the inception of business to a former client of HIH that had made known claims upon HIH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">In another case, Aon had submitted a proposal for renewal to QBE on the basis that it was to be a run off policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Williams confirmed that QBE would normally afford run off or retroactive cover provided it was already the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">86 That is consistent with the experience with Macquarie Underwriting to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">It is also consistent with the experience upon renewal of the Investment Managers Policy with AIG in October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Although it did not cover Tasman Investment for its financial planning activities, it was a PI policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">General Condition 5 was as follows:
 
 " Continuity 
 Cover is provided under Insuring Clauses A and B of this policy for any Claim , fact, matter or circumstance which could or should have been notified under any earlier policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Provided always that: 
 
 
 (a) the Claim , fact, matter or circumstance could and should have been notified after the Continuity Date ; and 
 (b) the cover provided by this Condition shall be on the same terms, exceptions and conditions as the policy under which the Claim , fact, matter or circumstance could and should have been notified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">" 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">)
 
 

The continuity date was 31 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">87 Based upon the evidence, it can be inferred that if Aon had approached Macquarie Underwriting on the basis that the financial planning business was in truth a continuing business, although carried on by another entity, that PI insurance would have been issued as if it were a renewal on terms no less favourable than the quote given as to premium and with retroactive cover to Tasman Investment and Warne to at least the inception of business and on the basis that prior known circumstances would be covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">At the very least, the evidence required an explanation from Aon as to precisely what occurred between it and Macquarie Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">That explanation may, in turn, have required an explanation from Macquarie Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Counsel for the defendants is on strong ground in relying upon the unexplained failure of Aon to call any witness of its own, particularly either or both of Elia and Kazakova.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">A clear Jones v Dunkel inference is to be drawn ( Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298).</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">The consequence is that the inference available from the evidence that a renewal on suitable terms to cover the Tasman Investment run off would have been available from Macquarie Underwriting can be more readily, and is, drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">88 In my opinion, counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting, particularly Stuart Coleman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">Macquarie and Aon are not in the "same camp" and Coleman is not under the control of Aon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">In a sense, he was available to both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">However, only the broker, Aon, had dealings with the potential insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The client was not, and would never be, directly in that loop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Between the parties here, it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants ( Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 per Glass JA at 201---202; Prasad v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 133 ; (1991) 101 ALR 109 at 123; Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 275 ; (1989) 23 FCR 331 at 343---344; Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457 per McClellan AJA at [62]---[64]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">89 I am also satisfied that Johnson and Warne, if properly advised by Aon, would have accepted Macquarie's terms if Tasman Investment was a party and satisfactory run off cover was included, unless Aon was able to arrange more favourable insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Aon simply did not analyse the offers with the run off as a factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">If that issue had been pointed out, the commercial reality was that the risk had to be covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Non-disclosure 
 
90 Aon pleaded the following defence to the second amended cross-claim:
 
 "In further answer to the whole of the Second Amended Cross-Claim, Aon: 
 
 
 
 (a) says that it was a duty imposed upon TIML and Warne prior to the entry of any contract of insurance, including: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) any investment management insurance contract entered into on or about 31 October 2001; or 
 (ii) any professional indemnity insurance contract entered into on or about 30 March 2002, 
 
 
 
 
 (31 October 2001 and 30 March 2002 being respectively 'relevant dates') to disclose to any prospective insurer every matter that: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) TIML and/or Warne knew to be a matter relevant to the decision of the prospective insurer whether to accept the risk the subject of the proposed contract of insurance and, if so, on what terms; or 
 (ii) a reasonable person in the circumstances TIML and/or Warne could be expected to know to be a matter so relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 
 The duty was imposed by virtue of the operation of s 21 of the Insurance Contracts Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">To the extent that the Cross-Claimants were named parties under any contract of insurance pursuant to s 48 of the Insurance Contracts Act , the obligation arises under s 48(2)(a) , s 48(3) or on the basis that the rights under s 48 carry with them a relevant duty of disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">
 (b) says that in the periods preceding the relevant dates, TIML and Warne knew: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) that TIML (then known as Warne Investment Management Limited) had raised money from clients of TIML ('clients') for use by Longevity Management Systems Pty Limited ('LMS') in the purchase and development of the Queen Victoria Nursing Home and hospital site at Wentworth Falls, Blue Mountains ('QV project') in circumstances where the form of the interest to be purchased by the clients had not been settled upon; 
 (ii) that the fundraising was based upon an information memorandum prepared by TIML ('information memorandum') being sent by TIML to a large number of its clients; 
 (iii) that any fundraising had to comply with the provisions of Part 6D.2 of the Corporations Act unless exempted; 
 (iv) that it was intended by TIML and Warne that the fundraising fall within the 'sophisticated investors' exemption to the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Act (s 708(8)-(10)); 
 (v) that unless the fundraising fell within the 'sophisticated investors' exemption to the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Act , the fundraising would be in breach of the Corporations Act ;
 (vi) that a draft agreement had been prepared for use by TIML, LMS and the clients ('draft agreement'); 
 (vii) that it was a term of the draft agreement that initially the client monies that were the subject of the fundraising would be deposited by the clients into a trust account in the name of Warne Investment Management Limited; 
 (viii) that it was a term of the draft agreement that the release of client monies by TIML to LMS from the TIML trust account was subject to each of TIML and LMS being satisfied that the advance by the client to LMS was an excluded issue under s 708 of the Corporations Act ; 
 (ix) either or both: 
 
 
 
 (A) the conditions that needed to be satisfied to meet the 'sophisticated investors' provisions; and/or 
 (B) that they had not satisfied themselves at the time of the fundraising as to the conditions that needed to be satisfied to meet those provisions; 
 
 
 
 (x) either or both that: 
 
 
 
 (A) at least Mr Tosich, and perhaps other clients of TIML who had been sent the information memorandum, did not satisfy the criteria to qualify as a 'sophisticated investor'; and/or 
 (B) the information memorandum had been sent out to clients without the Cross-Claimants then being satisfied that each of those clients met the criteria to qualify as a 'sophisticated investor', or, alternatively without then knowing what that criteria was; 
 
 
 
 (xi) either or both that: 
 
 
 
 (A) a written statement required by s 708(10)(c) of the Corporations Act had not been provided to each of the clients and none of the clients had signed an acknowledgement required by s 708(10)(d) of the Corporations Act before or at the time when the offer to invest (by way of the information memorandum) had been made to each of the clients; or 
 (B) the information memorandum had been sent out to clients without the Cross-Claimants then being satisfied if there were any information disclosure requirements under the 'sophisticated investors' provisions of the Corporations Act , 
 
 
 
 (xii) all client monies that had been agreed by the clients to be invested had been paid over to LMS; 
 (xiii) that the said monies had been raised and invested: 
 
 
 
 (A) in breach of the Corporations Act and the draft loan agreement; 
 (B) alternatively, without TIML taking steps to satisfy itself as to whether the Corporations Act and the terms of the draft loan agreement had been breached; 
 
 
 
 (xiv) that the information memorandum had calculated both the costs and timing of the investment by the clients on the basis that development approval would be received by June 2001, allowing construction to commence in July 2001; 
 (xv) that at each relevant date: 
 
 
 
 (A) development approval had not yet been obtained; 
 (B) construction had not yet commenced; 
 
 
 
 (xvi) that, as a consequence of (xiv) and (xv) above, even if construction did ultimately progress, it was unlikely that the clients would receive the anticipated returns at the anticipated times identified in the information memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">
 
 
 
 
 (c) says that each of the above matters individually were matters that: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) TIML and Warne knew to be matters relevant to the decision of the prospective insurer whether to accept the risk the subject of the proposed contract of insurance and, if so, on what terms; or 
 (ii) a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know to be a matter so relevant; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) says that if TIML and Warne had complied with their statutory duties and disclosed the above matters to any potential insurer from the relevant dates, then TIML and Warne would not have been protected by insurance that would have been indemnified them in respect of claims arising out of: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the said fundraising; 
 (ii) the QV project; 
 
 
 
 
 (e) further, and in the alternative to (d), says that in the circumstances described in (a)-(c) above, an insurer that had provided investment management insurance or professional indemnity insurance for TIML and Warne for the period from the relevant dates would have been entitled pursuant to s 28(3) of the Insurance Contracts Act to reduce to nil its exposure to any claim for indemnity from TIML and/or Warne in respect of the said fundraising and/or the QV project; 
 (f) says that if, which is denied, Aon breached its retainer as alleged by TIML and Warne, Aon says that any such breach is not causative of loss to TIML and/or Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">" 
 
 
 (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">) 
 
 
 
 

91 This defence is principally based upon s 21 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) that provides, so far as presently relevant, as follows:
 
 
 "(1) Subject to this Act, an insured has a duty to disclose to the insurer, before the relevant contract of insurance is entered into, every matter that is known to the insured, being a matter that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the insured knows to be a matter relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what terms; or 
 (b) a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know to be a matter so relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">" 
 
 
 

92 The topic is contended to be relevant in two ways: in the first place, if proper disclosure had been made, the risk would not have been accepted; and, in the second place, if the risk had been accepted and the policy issued, it would have been liable to cancellation once the true circumstances emerged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">93 Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">(1) "Knows" and "known" are strong words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">They mean considerably more than "believes" or "suspects" or even "strongly suspects" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259).</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">(2) The "matter" must be known to the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">(3) On one alternative, the "matter" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms --- in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] :
 
 
 "Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">" 
 
 
 

Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">(See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">) 
 
(4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">(5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">There is some debate about the meaning of the words "the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">(6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can "know" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] ---[89].</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610---611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">(7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353).</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">94 It follows from (3), (4) and (5) above that a claim of non-disclosure by an insurer would rarely succeed without that insurer giving evidence as to the relevance and significance of the matter not disclosed to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">It would be curious, to say the least, if the particular insurer led evidence as to the practice of other insurers but not from its own camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">Of course, this is not a claim against an insurer but, rather, a claim against the broker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">However, the broker led evidence from the other insurers but not from Macquarie Underwriting, which was the particular potential insurer, or from any other insurer that had actually been approached for cover in 2002, including Dexta, which granted cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">No explanation was tendered for that omission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The difficulty is all the greater because of the absence of any witness from the broker itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">It is not uncommon for a broker to be qualified to give evidence as to the state of a particular insurance market at a particular time, assuming a satisfactory actual knowledge of the practices of a sufficient cross-section of insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">95 Evidence from the other insurers has little, if any, probative value upon the point at issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Each insurer is a commercial entity competing for custom with differing business policies and practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">For this reason, it is dangerous for the Court to substitute its own opinion for evidence as to the practice of the relevant insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">An insurer actively seeking certain types of business will have very different attitudes from an insurer who is not keen to attract that type of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">It will be recalled that in 2000 Macquarie Underwriting was competing actively with HIH for PI business at levels considered to be uneconomic by the witnesses for the insurers that were called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Furthermore, it is clear from the cross-examination of the witnesses from the other insurers, based upon particular files, that general guidelines apparently laying down strict prudential standards by no means govern the consideration of every proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">There may be all manner of reasons why an insurer may wish to accommodate a particular proposal, notwithstanding the guidelines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">96 Warne, who was effectively the decision maker, was of the view that there was no occasion to give notice of circumstances that might give rise to a claim until the second half of 2002 when it became clear that the application for a retirement village would not succeed and that there had to be a radical recasting of the proposed venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">At that stage, the investors were notified accordingly and the claim from Tosich followed shortly thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">Notification was then given to AIG as the insurer claimed to be responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">Warne's evidence in this respect was somewhat confused, partly because the cross-examination was conducted by counsel for AIG who had objectives relevant to its client in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">A particular difficulty arose for Warne because of an answer given in relation to renewal of the AIG policy in October 2002 where an answer "No" was given to the question:
 
 "Does the Fund Manager or any of its Directors, officers or employees have any knowledge of any fact or circumstances which might give rise to a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">" 
 

Warne conceded that he should have advised the insurer at that time if the insured had been aware of the potential Corporations Law breaches and potential loss of capital in the Queen Victoria Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">In my opinion, counsel for AIG is correct in putting that the true explanation of that answer is that the AIG policy was, in truth, regarded by Warne as only relevant to the Wollongong Prime Property Trust and not to the Queen Victoria Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">By the time of the AIG renewal, all of the material matters concerning the Queen Victoria Trust were all too clear to the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">97 The real question is whether a duty of disclosure arose before or at the time that PI insurance was to be renewed in March/April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">The pleading essentially relies upon breaches of the Corporations Law and the defendants' knowledge about them, together with delay in relation to the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">That was also the foundation of the evidence led from the witnesses from the other insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">98 I am satisfied that the defendants knew of the likelihood of breaches of the Corporations Law in relation to the fundraising for the Queen Victoria Project from at least late 2001 after the first Phillips Fox letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">I am also satisfied that Johnson was also aware of that circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">I am satisfied that Harrison drew Warne's attention to the potential problem and that knowledge of the first Phillips Fox letter would have come to the attention of both Johnson and Warne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">It was significant enough not to be forgotten.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">In particular, I find that Warne knew of the substance of that letter and that it remained present to his mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">On the other hand, I am not satisfied that it was a matter of particular concern to Johnson and Warne until after March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">99 The pleading relies upon the fact that the progress of the Queen Victoria Project was slower than had been represented by the time of renewal of the PI insurance in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">However, there is no evidence of active investor concern at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Warne had circulated a progress report to investors including Tosich in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">That indicated a program that would take some time to complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Tosich expressed concern to Warne some weeks thereafter about progress, but did not follow the matter up with Warne until about August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">By then, the withdrawal of the Development Application was public and Tasman Investment had recognised the inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">The first record of a complaint from an investor was in early July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The critical letter from the Council to Chris Lonergan &amp; Associates was not sent until 17 April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The pleading does not allege that Warne knew of the impending failure of the project at the time of effecting PI insurance in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">There is no evidence of any real concern on the part of Warne about the project up to the time of the renewal, notwithstanding that he was an investor in his own right as well as being, in effect, responsible for the investments by his clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">In short, Warne appears to have remained a true believer until after March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">His draft letter to investors was dated 13 May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">That timing explains his lack of concern about potential breaches of the Corporations Law during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">It can be concluded that Warne would not have known that the disclosure would be relevant to Macquarie Underwriting in March/April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Neither Johnson nor Warne was cross-examined on the part of Aon on the topic of non-disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">100 Aon seeks to sidestep this aspect of the matter by aggregating the knowledge of all relevant officers of the Warne group, including Harrison's knowledge through his LMS connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Even if that doubtful proposition be legitimate in this context, it could not rise higher than the pleaded circumstances --- likely breach of the Corporations Law and delay in the Queen Victoria Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Those circumstances were known to Warne in substance and have been dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">101 Thus, the issue of non-disclosure is to be decided without any evidence from any relevant potential insurer, from the insurance broker actually involved and without any relevant admissions on the part of the potential insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">102 I have adverted to the problem confronting Aon in the absence of evidence from Macquarie Underwriting or Aon itself on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">It cannot be doubted that the existence of the pleaded circumstances might be regarded by an insurer as relevant to the decision as to whether to accept the risk in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">But that does not establish that this insurer would so regard it, let alone that this insured, or a reasonable person in the circumstances, would know it to be so relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">103 There could, no doubt, be a case where the circumstances are such that it can be taken that any reasonable insured would know that any insurer would regard them as relevant to cover of the risk proposed without the benefit of evidence from the insurer or broker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">It may be that the position arrived at by September/October 2002 would fall into that category so far as PI insurance in relation to run off insurance for Tasman Investments was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">A fund raising that was advised to be likely to be in breach of the Corporations Law was clearly failing, with the investors likely to suffer considerable losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">In my opinion, the same cannot be said of the circumstances in March/early April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The likelihood of loss on the investment was not known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The possibility of breaches of the law in relation to the fund raising was known, but that is as high as it reached at that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">That was likely to be academic if the project succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The relevance of that circumstance to a particular insurer needs to be established by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">It is conceivable that such evidence could have been led, but it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">For the Court to fill that gap and make a finding as to that issue would amount to speculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">I conclude that it has not been established that a failure to disclose the pleaded circumstances would have given rise to any relief in relation to the hypothetical Macquarie Underwriting policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">The same reasoning would apply in relation to the application of s 28(3) ( Manchester Unity Total Care Building Society v MGICA Ltd (1991) 6 ANZ Ins Cas 61-062).</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">104 I am, thus, satisfied that the proper basis for quantification of loss is to assume that a Macquarie Underwriting policy would have issued based upon the proposal it received, including Tasman Investment as an insured with a retroactive date at least back to the inception of the business in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">The policy would, thus, have responded to claims made in the period from March 2002 to March 2003 arising from circumstances occurring in June---November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">Such claims would have clearly fallen clearly within the insured risk and there has been no suggestion of any relevant exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Allowance will have to be made for the proposed deductible of $20,000 per claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Some allowance should be made for the higher premium proposed by Macquarie Underwriting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">It would not be right in principle to allocate all of that increase to the one claim by Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">The amount recovered of $25,608.38 should be deducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">There should also be a modest discount to reflect the possibility that a policy on appropriate terms might not have issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">All in all, the cross-claimants should recover the sum of $70,000 plus interest in relation to Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">105 Little attention was paid to the claims in relation to Roach and Kotwal and no special defence was raised in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">The fact that they were paid out is of no consequence as there was no relevant policy in force at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The only distinction is that they were made later than that by Tosich.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">If proper insurance had been obtained, that should not have been relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The quantification of these claims needs to be further considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">SUMMARY 
 
106 The first plaintiff Tosich succeeds on his claim against the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">The cross-claim by the defendants against AIG fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">The cross-claim by the defendants against Aon succeeds to the extent indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">107 The proceeding will stand over to enable draft minutes of order to be brought in to give effect to these reasons, to deal with costs and to enable my attention to be drawn to any failure to deal with a necessary issue.</sentence>
