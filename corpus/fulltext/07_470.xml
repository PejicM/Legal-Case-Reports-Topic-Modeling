<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant Mr Roderick Salfinger seeks an order that the legal firm Blake Dawson Waldron (BDW) be restrained from acting for the first respondent Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd in this proceeding and from providing any information or disclosure on the business of the former company Arkaroola Resources Pty Ltd in respect of a certain proceeding in the Supreme Court of Queensland to any other legal practitioner or person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 BDW has never acted for Mr Salfinger or Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">However in the Queensland proceeding solicitors Mr Ray Lindwall and Ms Heidi Schweirkert, then at Corrs Chambers Westgarth, acted for Arkaroola and BDW acted for Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Subsequently Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert moved to BDW, but they have since left that firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Queensland proceeding 
 
3 In January 2000, by an asset transfer deed, Niugini Mining transferred the Red Dome mine site and associated assets to Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 18 December 2000 Niugini Mining terminated the deed because of alleged breaches by Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 22 December 2000 Arkaroola commenced the Queensland proceeding against Niugini Mining alleging that the deed was improperly terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In the present proceeding, commenced in the Federal Court on 18 December 2006, Mr Salfinger as assignee of Arkaroola and in his own right makes substantially the same claim against Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He alleges unconscionable conduct, unjust enrichment and breaches of contract and fiduciary duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 On 3 January 2001, on Mr Lindwall's application, an expedited timetable for delivery of pleadings in the Queensland proceeding, was directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 In March 2001 Corrs ceased to act for Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">6 On 20 August 2001 Mr Lindwall left the Corrs partnership and became a partner at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Ms Schweirkert joined BDW at the same time as an employee senior associate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Two other Corrs' employees not involved in the Arkaroola matter, solicitor Thomas Boyd and articled clerk Thomas Vincent, also joined BDW about the same time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It would seem that the four transferred from Corrs to BDW as a group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 On 18 October 2001 Fryberg J struck out the Queensland proceeding on the ground of Arkaroola's repeated failure to comply with directions of the Court concerning the prosecution of the action, and specifically its failure to provide affidavits and expert reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Confidential information 
 
8 Mr Salfinger deposes that in late December 2000 and early January 2001 he had a number of discussions with Mr Lindwall and Mr Nicholas Andreatidis, another solicitor at Corrs, in relation to the deed and "in respect to providing extensive information about the affairs of Arkaroola with particular emphasis to (Niugini Mining)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He intended to make Mr Lindwall and Mr Andreatidis "aware of the affairs and business dealings of Arkaroola and (himself) so that they could properly represent Arkaroola in the then intended litigation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He goes on to say:
 
 "These discussions covered many aspects of the operations of Arkaroola and various litigation strategies that we could use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The discussions also included various personal issues and financial and asset status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I understood that the discussions were held under solicitor client confidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">On behalf of Arkaroola, I provided Corrs with an extensive brief on Arkaroola's involvement with the deed and Red Dome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This brief became part of the files of Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">" 
 

He also deposes that his discussions: 
 
 "included confidential details of my then current business interests in North America and my current and former residential status in North America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">" 
 Evidence of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert 
 
9 Between December 2000 and March 2001 Mr Lindwall was the partner at Corrs with responsibility for the Queensland proceeding, with the assistance of senior associates Mr Andreatidis and Ms Schweirkert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">As already mentioned, Corrs ceased acting for Arkaroola in March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Lindwall believes that he did not have any further dealings with Arkaroola or Mr Salfinger after Corrs ceased to act for the company, apart from possible discussions in relation to unpaid accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 Mr Lindwall joined BDW on 20 August 2001 and commenced work in the Litigation and Dispute Resolution Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">When he left Corrs to join BDW he did not take any documents of any nature relating to Arkaroola, the Queensland proceeding or Mr Salfinger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">11 When Mr Lindwall joined BDW he advised Mr Guy Humble, the partner in charge of the Litigation and Dispute Resolution Group, that he had acted for Arkaroola at Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Humble said he was aware of the matter but had no involvement with it as it was being handled by Mr Kimmins under the supervision of Mr John Briggs, a partner in BDW's Resources Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Lindwall and Mr Humble agreed that they would have no further discussion in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This was the only discussion that Mr Lindwall had while at BDW about the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He understood then, and understands now, that he has a professional responsibility as a solicitor to maintain the confidences of his previous clients notwithstanding that any retainer with him personally has terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 Mr Lindwall had no involvement in the Queensland proceeding while at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He did not provide any information, document or thing relating to Arkaroola, Mr Salfinger or his partner Mr Barry Moshel to any person at BDW, either while he worked there or after he ceased to be a partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">13 Mr Lindwall left BDW on 31 October 2005 and is now practising in partnership with Ms Schweirkert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">He has not discussed any matters relating to Arkaroola or Mr Salfinger with any person at BDW since leaving the firm (other than in relation to the preparation of his affidavit).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">14 Ms Schweirkert says that she assisted Mr Lindwall in relation to the Queensland proceeding while at Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">She joined BDW as a senior associate on 20 August 2001 in the Litigation and Dispute Resolute Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">15 When she left Corrs she did not take with her any documents of any nature relating to Arkaroola or the Queensland proceeding and those files and related documents remained with Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">During the time she was a BDW she did not discuss the dispute involving Arkaroola, the Queensland proceeding or anyone concerned with that company with anyone at BDW except Mr Lindwall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">She had no involvement in the Queensland proceeding while she was at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">She did not provide any information, document or thing relating to Arkaroola to any person at BDW whilst she worked at the firm or after she ceased to work there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">16 Ms Schweirkert ceased employment with BDW on 30 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Evidence of solicitors at BDW 
 
17 Mr John Briggs was the partner at BDW responsible for the conduct of the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">18 On 30 March 2001 he was informed by Mr Lindwall that Corrs had ceased acting for Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">19 On 16 August 2001 BDW sent a fax to Mr Salfinger advising that from Monday 28 August 2001 Mr Lindwall would join BDW as a litigation partner in the Brisbane office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The fax noted that previously Mr Lindwall was a partner at Corrs and at one stage provided advice to Arkaroola but that:
 
 "Mr Lindwall would of course have no involvement in the Brisbane matter nor any future matters involving Arkaroola Resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Further Mr Lindwall will not be asked, nor will he comment on any matter associated with the present dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">" 

20 Mr Briggs says that at no time did he discuss the Queensland proceeding, Arkaroola or Mr Salfinger with Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert after they joined BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">He said that so far as he is aware no documents of any nature of any relevance to the Queensland proceeding or the present proceeding were brought across by Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert to BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">21 At no time has Mr Lindwall, Ms Schweirkert, Mr Boyd or Mr Vincent or any other person retained by Arkaroola or Mr Salfinger provided confidential information to Mr Briggs regarding Arkaroola, Mr Salfinger or the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Lindwall, Ms Schweirkert, Mr Boyd and Mr Vincent had no involvement in the Queensland proceeding while they were at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">22 Mr Michael Kimmins has been a partner with Corrs since approximately November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Between January 1991 and 26 October 2001 he worked at BDW as a solicitor, senior associate and then special counsel in the Dispute Resolution Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In 2001 at BDW he had the day to day conduct, on behalf of Niugini Mining, of the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">When Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert joined BDW to the best of Mr Kimmins' knowledge they had nothing to do with the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Niugini Mining file was located in Mr Kimmins' office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">During the conduct of the Queensland proceeding he never spoke to or otherwise communicated with either Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert about the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">23 Mr Jeremy Chenoweth is a solicitor employed by BDW and, subject to Mr Lobban's direction, has the conduct of the present Federal Court proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He has worked in the Litigation and Dispute Resolution Group within the Brisbane office of BDW since January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">During his time with BDW Mr Chenoweth did not work with Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert on any file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">They worked as a separate team within the Litigation and Dispute Resolution Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Chenoweth did not have any involvement in the Queensland proceeding and did not work in the Brisbane office of BDW at the time of that proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Mr Chenoweth has never spoken to Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert or otherwise communicated with them about the facts and circumstances of the Queensland proceeding, or about Arkaroola and Mr Salfinger or the dispute between Arkaroola and Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">His knowledge of the file has only arisen after the departure of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert from BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">24 Mr Chenoweth has reviewed the material retained by BDW in respect of the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The file is extensive and comprises fourteen boxes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The only communications between any member of BDW and Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert regarding the Queensland proceeding or in relation to Arkaroola apparent from the file occurred when Mr Lindwall was a partner at Corrs and Ms Schweirkert a senior associate at that firm and before Corrs ceased to act for Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">There were no documents held in the files of BDW containing any material in any way relevant to the present proceeding that could be confidential to Arkaroola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">25 Mr Chenoweth arranged a search of BDW's Keystone billing system which records time and narratives for time each person works on a file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The system does not show any time recorded for Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert on the file relevant to the Queensland proceeding or any file for Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">26 Mr John Lobban is the partner at BDW in charge of the present Federal Court proceeding for Niugini Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">He did not have any involvement in the Queensland proceeding, although his advice may have been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">His involvement in the present matter arose only after the departure of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert from BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He did not communicate with Mr Lindwall or Ms Schweirkert in respect of the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He is not aware of BDW having possession of any documents or recording confidential information in respect of Arkaroola or Mr Salfinger and has no reason to believe the files of Arkaroola in respect of the Queensland proceeding did not remain at Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">27 Mr Boyd had no involvement with any matter involving Arkaroola while at Corrs or at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">He left BDW on 24 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He has kept in touch with Mr Thomas Vincent who has been employed by Deutsche Bank in London since April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Restraining solicitors from acting 
 
28 In recent times applications to restrain solicitors from acting against clients or former clients have arisen not infrequently and have been the subject of detailed consideration in Australian courts, in particular in Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248 ; (2001) 4 VR 501 (Victorian Court of Appeal), Bureau Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne v Red Earth Nominees Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 588 (Ryan J), Photocure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2002) 56 IPR 86 (Goldberg J) and Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 (Young J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The leading English authority is the House of Lords' decision in Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm) [1998] UKHL 52 ; [1999] 2 AC 222.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">29 It is not necessary to review these authorities in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The issues calling for resolution in the present case are within a short compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">30 Since BDW never acted for Mr Salfinger or Arkaroola, and indeed have always acted against them, this case does not present the situation of a solicitor acting against a present or former client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">31 I will assume for present purposes that Mr Salfinger has made out a case with sufficient particularity that confidential information concerning his affairs and those of Arkaroola passed into the possession of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert when they were at Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Such confidential information would extend to what Gillard J in Yunghanns v Elfic Ltd (Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported, 3 July 1998) has characterised as the "getting to know you" factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour said at 10-11:
 
 "In some cases the circumstances of the retainer and the nature of the legal work will be sufficient to establish the nature of the confidential information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In this regard the relationship between solicitor and client may be such that the solicitor learns a great deal about his client, his strengths, his weaknesses, his honesty or lack thereof, his reaction to crisis, pressure or tension, his attitude to litigation and settling cases and his tactics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">These are factors which I would call the 'getting to know you' factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The overall opinion formed by a solicitor of his client as a result of his contact may in the circumstances amount to confidential information that should not be disclosed or used against the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">" 


See also Mintel International Group Ltd v Mintel (Australia) Pty Ltd (2000) 181 ALR 78 at [37]-[44].</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">32 However, the critical question is whether the knowledge of Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert should be imputed to other lawyers at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In Red Earth at [34] Ryan J said:
 
 "It is now well established that the knowledge of a solicitor joining a new firm should not automatically be imputed or attributed to other lawyers or employees at that firm (see Re a Firm of Solicitors [1992] QB 959 at 973, per Staughton LJ; Unioil International Pty Ltd v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (1997) 17 WAR 98, per Ipp J at 110-111; Newman v Phillips Fox (1999) 21 WAR 309, per Steytler J; Bolkiah (supra) at 235).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As Lord Millett said in Bolkiah , whether a particular individual is in possession of confidential information is a question of fact to be proved or inferred from the circumstances of the case: ( Bolkiah at 235.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">See also the observation of Steytler J in Newman v Phillips Fox (supra) at 317).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">

33 Applying that principle, and assuming the onus is on BDW, I am satisfied that no relevant information was passed on to anyone at BDW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The detailed evidence both from Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweirkert and from solicitors at BDW, the veracity of which was not challenged, enables that conclusion to be safely drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The circumstances point the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">A large and reputable firm like BDW would be aware of the obvious potential conflict when a solicitor previously acting on the other side of litigation has joined them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This would be clear, notwithstanding that Corrs had ceased acting for Arkaroola some six months earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">So there was all the more reason to take positive steps, such as notifying the former client of Mr Lindwall and going out of their way to ensure that he had nothing to do with any matters relating to that client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">34 As events have turned out, Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert left BDW before the present Federal Court litigation commenced so the risk of even accidental communication of relevant information hereafter can be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">35 Mr Salfinger raised one particular matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In early January 2001 he retained Mr David Finney of C &amp; B Consultants of Cairns to prepare an expert's report and supporting affidavit for the Queensland proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">On Mr Salfinger's instructions Mr Lindwall and Mr Andreatidis prepared a brief for Mr Finney which contained confidential information and sent it to him on 9 March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">36 Mr Salfinger called Mr Finney in July and August 2001 to request the affidavit and again in September when he was given an "evasive response" and was told that C &amp; B was not now willing to provide the affidavit and report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">37 On 4 September 2002, ie a year later, he called C &amp; B to see if it were possible to get the affidavit in support of their report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">On the same day he received a fax from C &amp; B stating that they were now able to provide the affidavit to support the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It stated:
 
 "Rod, Further to or discussion today, please note that C &amp; B will prepare an affidavit to support the 2001 Tailings Dam Seepage Contamination Report and follow up letter report of 10 January 2002, however because of our conflict of interest concern, we could only undertake the work after completion of our current Niugini Mining project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">This project is likely to be completed in 4 weeks" 

38 I do not see how this matter is relevant to the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It would appear that C &amp; B provided some kind of report in early 2002 but by this time Corrs had ceased to act for Arkaroola and Mr Lindwall and Ms Schweikert had left Corrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">39 I order that:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The application be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Directions Hearing be adjourned to 5 June 2007 at 9.30 am.</sentence>
