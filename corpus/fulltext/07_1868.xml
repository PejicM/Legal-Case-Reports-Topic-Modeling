<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, contends that the corporate defendants (the HLP group) operated a managed investment scheme in breach of s 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">This section requires the scheme to be registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">ASIC seeks a declaration that the scheme was an unregistered managed investment scheme and an order that it be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">ASIC also contends that the second defendant, Mr Berlowitz, who is said to have controlled the HLP group, himself operated the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Accordingly, ASIC seeks a declaration that Mr Berlowitz operated the illegal scheme and that he carried on a financial services business without an Australian financial services licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">ASIC also wants an injunction permanently restraining Mr Berlowitz from operating a financial services business or from seeking funds from investors in connection with the operation of an unregistered managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The issue in dispute is whether, even if the facts are made out, the orders should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 It is convenient to begin with a description of the arrangements put into effect by the HLP group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">As little as possible will be said about the role of Mr Berlowitz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">His position will be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The starting point is with the structure of the HLP group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (HLPFP) was the lead company in the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It described its activities as "seek[ing] out and develop[ing] worthy investment opportunities for its clients and client investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">" HLPFP conducted its operation as trustee of the HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Unit Trust (HLP Unit Trust).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Four companies in the HLP group each held 41 units in the HLP Unit Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Each company was in turn the trustee of a unit trust and held the units in that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Initially all the units in the sub-trusts were held by Leaberl Pty Ltd, another member of the HLP group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">3 Some time after March 2005 HLPFP began looking for investors willing to purchase units in the sub-trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A prospectus entitled "Private Investment Opportunity" was used to promote the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">According to the prospectus, "[b]y acquiring units in [one of the sub-trusts], an investor becomes an indirect unit holder of the HLP Financial Planning (Aust) unit trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This entitles the investor to the distribution of profit in line with their percentage ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">" The minimum amount an investor could subscribe was $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The money invested together with other investors' money was to be applied toward the purchase of "loan books" upon which interest would be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In the "Investment Summary" section there was a profit forecast for each of the financial years ending 30 June 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The projected return for those years based on a minimum investment of $50,000 was $2,500, $5,500, $28,500 and $33,500 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">That is, potential investors were told the total amount of anticipated distributions an investor would receive over four years was $70,000, with distributions to be made monthly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The prospectus provided a description of the HLP group and details of past projects undertaken by some group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There was also a discussion about "Future Projects", one of which it was asserted had "guaranteed" minimum monthly returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">A section headed "Benefits and Limitations" contained discussion of "investment benefits" and "investment risks".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On the benefits side it was said that: "The projected level of the returns (although not guaranteed) generated by the investment should provide a reasonable potential for capital growth and regular profit disbursements... Investors will have common investment objectives...</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The business investment will be professionally managed on behalf of the investors..." The discussion of risks was brief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The principal risks were: "The sale price of units purchased, like shares, reflects no increase or a lesser amount than the cost... [the] [i]nability to sell the units quickly... [and the] [g]eneral commercial risk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">4 Between April 2005 and September 2005 55 investors purchased units in the sub-trusts from Leaberl.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The aggregate amount invested was $4,295,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Most of the money went to Leaberl.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Some money, approximately $150,000, found its way into the accounts of other HLP group companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">5 For a time everything seemed to be going well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Investors received interest payments as had been promised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Then in late 2005 investors were told there was a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In a letter dated 7 December 2005 under the hand of Mr Berlowitz investors were informed that "HLP has been forced to take a new direction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The letter went on to explain that as a result of fighting "the legal dispute with 'sacked CEO' of [a HLP group company] we have fallen behind in the momentum of all the businesses".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As a result of the dispute all HLP group companies bar one had "ceased trading".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Investors were advised that they would continue "to receive all [their] current regular monthly payments" but that it was necessary to sell the group's one remaining business "and this will result in all of [the investors'] original investment being repaid to [them] in full by about 30/12/06".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">6 In the new year investors were told there was an alternative to having their investment repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The alternative was explained in a letter from Mr Berlowitz dated 14 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It was the "conversion" of the investment into a loan to Beachmere View Pty Ltd (Beachmere) and Mr Berlowitz as joint borrowers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Investors were advised that interest on the loan would be paid monthly at the rate of 10 per cent per annum commencing on 1 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">They were told they had the option of redeeming their investment or entering into the loan agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">If an investor opted for the loan, he or she could nominate the term of the loan as being any of one to eight years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Most, if not all, investors took up the offer and entered into a written loan agreement with Beachmere and Mr Berlowitz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">7 The HLP scheme came to the attention of ASIC which then commenced an investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">During the course of that investigation ASIC obtained documents in response to notices served under s 30 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It also used its power under s 19 of the ASIC Act to examine Mr Berlowitz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">8 This action was commenced when the investigation had concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">An urgent application was made to wind up the HLP companies (other than HLP Mortgage Company (Aust) Pty Ltd) and to obtain holding orders pending trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The HLP companies were wound up without objection and Mr Berlowitz gave undertakings not to dispose of his assets pending trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">9 Mr Georges of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as liquidator of the HLP companies being wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Since his appointment Mr Georges has conducted a preliminary investigation into the affairs of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He has filed a report setting out the results of his investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">One topic discussed by Mr Georges is the financial position of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Mr Judd QC, who with Mr Segal appeared for Mr Berlowitz, objected to the tender of the report because ASIC had not arranged for Mr Georges to be present for cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Still, I propose to refer to his discussion of the financial position of the group as it seems to be uncontroversial: Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), s 190.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Mr Georges says that Leaberl is the only company in the HLP group with any tangible assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That company is, however, insolvent, having a deficiency of assets over liabilities of over $12 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Georges' view is that the position of the group overall is much worse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Investors are owed more than $35 million and there is little prospect of them recovering any money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">10 I mention this aspect of Mr Georges' report to explain the course this action has taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Initially ASIC sought an order that if the scheme established by the HLP group was an unregistered managed investment scheme it should be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In light of Mr Georges' assessment of the financial position of the HLP group, ASIC believes that nothing would be gained by a winding up order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is now of the opinion that it would be in the best interests of investors if the assets under Mr Georges' control were distributed without incurring the additional cost of winding up the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On the other hand, ASIC still seeks a declaration that the scheme is an unregistered managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Judd says making that declaration is a waste of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">11 This particular dispute raises two issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The first is whether the scheme is a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">If it is, it is common ground that the scheme was not registered as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The second issue is whether, in the circumstances, a declaration should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">12 Section 9 of the Corporations Act relevantly defines a managed investment scheme as a scheme that has the following features: (a) investors contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights to benefits produced by the scheme; (b) the contributions are to be pooled or used in a common enterprise to produce the financial benefits; and (c) the investors do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There is no doubt that each element of the definition is satisfied here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Investors contributed funds to share in the profits of the loan book business conducted by HLPFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The funds were to be pooled to finance the operation of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">No investor had control over any aspect of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">13 The only point in contest (and only faintly so) is whether there should be a declaration that the scheme was an unregistered managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The power to grant declaratory relief derives from s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The power may be exercised whether or not other relief is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">ASIC seeks the declaration so that there will, as it were, be a statement on the public record that the scheme was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Judd contends there is no utility in making the declaration because the winding up of the HLP companies has resulted in the winding up of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Therefore, he says, nothing further need be done by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">14 It is true that the scheme was brought to an end when the HLP companies were wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Nonetheless it is appropriate to make the declaration sought by ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Many people put money into the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They are entitled to know that the scheme was illegal and that is one reason why the HLP group was wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The declaration will not enable the investors to recover their money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">But at least it will inform them what they had got themselves into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">15 The real debate in this case is whether I should consider making a declaration that Mr Berlowitz had operated the scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) and grant perpetual restraining orders against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Section 601ED(5) provides that a person must not "operate" a managed investment scheme unless the scheme is registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">There are several cases which hold that where a company operates an unregistered managed investment scheme its directors also "operate" the scheme: eg Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561, 574; Re Lawloan Mortgages Pty Ltd [2003] 2 Qd R 200, 218; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 132 , [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">According to those cases it all depends on the extent of the director's involvement in the management of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">16 The source of the court's power to grant a declaration has been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The court's power to grant an injunction is derived from ss 22 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In a company case the power also derives from s 1324 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The power to make each order is discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Here, however, we are not concerned with the usual factors that bear on the discretion to grant or withhold relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In this case the court acting in its civil jurisdiction is asked to make an order in relation to Mr Berlowitz' allegedly criminal conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In that kind of case special rules apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is necessary to examine those rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">17 Before undertaking that task two important features of this case should be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The first is that ASIC's investigation into the activities of Mr Berlowitz was not confined to determining whether he has committed merely regulatory offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Ms Marks, counsel for ASIC, told me that also under consideration is whether Mr Berlowitz should be charged with criminal offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">She did not identify the particular offences but indicated that if charges are laid ASIC's "preliminary view... is [that the charges would be tried in] a Victorian court, and probably the County Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">" It follows that consideration is being given to charging Mr Berlowitz with an indictable offence to tried before a jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">18 The second feature is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The evidence upon which ASIC will rely to establish that Mr Berlowitz operated the unregistered managed investment scheme is based substantially on statements (said to be admissions) he made during his s 19 examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">When an examination is conducted under s 19 the examinee must answer all relevant questions put to him: ASIC Act, s 21(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">A failure to answer a question without reasonable excuse is an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding 100 penalty units ($11,000) or imprisonment for two years or both: s 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Self-incrimination privilege is not a reason for refusing to answer a question: s 68(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">On the other hand, any statements made at a s 19 examination that might tend to incriminate the examinee or make him liable to a penalty is not admissible in a criminal proceeding or in a proceeding for the imposition of a civil penalty: s 68(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The effect of these provisions is that any statement made by Mr Berlowitz can be used against him in this proceeding because it is not a civil penalty proceeding (only declarations and injunctions are sought) but the statements could not be tendered in evidence in the contemplated criminal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">19 Now I come to the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The traditional view was that civil courts have no jurisdiction to grant relief in aid of or to supplement the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In Gee v Pritchard (1818) 2 Swans 402, 413 [36 ER 670, 674] Lord Eldon said: "I have no jurisdiction to prevent the commission of crimes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The jurisdictional impediment to the grant of an injunction was removed by ss 79 and 83 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 (UK); Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co v Beall (1882) 20 Ch D 501.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Nonetheless, civil courts remained reluctant to intervene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In Ramsay v Aberfoyle Manufacturing Co (Australia) Pty Ltd [1935] HCA 75 ; (1935) 54 CLR 230, 239 Latham CJ said: "A court of equity has no general duty to 'enforce the law,' either at the suit of the Attorney-General or of private persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">" McTiernan J said (at 255-256): "The provisions of the law for the trial and punishment of offenders are not to be supplanted or supplemented by this remedy [of injunction].</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" 
 
20 Notwithstanding this reluctance, on occasion courts would grant an injunction to restrain illegal (including criminal) conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Although the cases of interference were few, there were four broad categories in which intervention was thought to be justified: to ensure that statutory bodies acted within the limits of their jurisdiction; to enforce local laws; to enjoin those who flouted the law; to protect public safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Attorney-General v Westminster City Council [1924] 2 Ch 416 (an injunction to restrain a local council from using a library building for administrative purposes rather than as a public library) is an example of the first category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Cooney v Ku-ring-gai Municipal Council [1963] HCA 47 ; (1963) 114 CLR 582 falls into the second category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">There an injunction was granted to restrain the use of a building in a residential area for the purposes of trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The breach of the by-law caused disadvantage to residents living in the locality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">See also Attorney-General v Shrewsbury (Kingsland) Bridge Co (1882) 21 Ch D 752 (an injunction to restrain interference with a public highway and a public navigable stream by illegal acts of obstruction); Attorney-General v London and North Western Railway Co [1900] 1 QB 78 (an injunction to restrain a railway company from allowing its trains to exceed four miles per hour when travelling over a level crossing).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">21 The leading English example of a case in the third category is Attorney-General v Harris [1961] 1 QB 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The defendants had been convicted on countless occasions of selling flowers outside a cemetery contrary to a century old statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The flower stall was an obvious benefit to those who visited the cemetery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Nevertheless, Sellers LJ observed (at 86): "It cannot, in my opinion, be anything other than a public detriment for the law to be defied, week by week, and the offender to find it profitable to pay the fine and continue to flout the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">" 
 
22 A good example of a case in the fourth category is Attorney-General v Chaudry [1971] 1 WLR 1614.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">There the defendants had violated building safety regulations by permitting guests to occupy a hotel with inadequate fire safety precautions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The evidence showed there was a serious risk to the safety of patrons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Summary proceedings in the Magistrates Court for breach of the regulations were delayed so an application was made in the High Court of Justice for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing to accommodate guests in their hotel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The injunction was granted and the decision upheld by the Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">23 The cases of judicial interference are not limited to the four broad categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">There are examples, although rare, of interference in other circumstances: see, for example, Attorney-General ex rel Bedfordshire County Council v Howard United Reformed Church Trustees, Bedford [1976] AC 363 (an injunction to restrain the demolition of a listed building); Kent County Council v Batchelor (No 2) [1979] 1 WLR 213, 220 per Talbot J: ("It is not just a case of taking action to prevent a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It is a case of preventing interference with the areas of natural beauty which [the plaintiffs] have sought by their tree preservation orders to preserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">")
 
24 It will be noticed that the cases referred to are concerned with either offences of a regulatory character or breaches of a statutory provision affecting a public right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">They do not involve violations of the criminal law proper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">This is not to suggest that a civil court will not interfere in cases which involve serious criminality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">But, whatever type of criminal case, all the leading authorities caution against a court that is exercising civil jurisdiction attempting to supplant the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The consensus both in England and Australia is that this should only happen in exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">25 A good starting point is the decision in Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers [1977] UKHL 5 ; [1978] AC 435.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The plaintiff, a private citizen, sought a declaration that it was unlawful for two Post Office unions in protesting against apartheid to solicit interference with the mail to, or communications with, South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He also sought an injunction to restrain that interference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The trial judge refused the injunction holding he had no jurisdiction to grant it when the Attorney-General would not bring a relator action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">On appeal to the Court of Appeal an interim injunction was granted and declarations were made against the unions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The validity of those orders were in dispute when the matter came before the House of Lords.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Several of the Law Lords dealt with the "comparatively modern use" (as Lord Wilberforce described it at 481) of the Attorney-General invoking the assistance of a civil court in aid of the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Lord Wilberforce said (at 481): "It is an exceptional power confined, in practice, to cases where an offence is frequently repeated in disregard of a, usually, inadequate penalty... or to cases of emergency...</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is one not without its difficulties".</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Later (at 481) he said that: "[T]his jurisdiction --- though proved useful on occasions --- is one of great delicacy and is one to be used with caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">" Viscount Dilhorne said (at 491) that the exercise of the jurisdiction to intervene is "exceptional".</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Earlier he had identified the kinds of problems that might arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The relevant passage is worth quoting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">He said (at 490-491):
 
 "Great difficulties may arise if 'enforcement' of the criminal law by injunction became a regular practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">A person charged, for instance, with an offence under section 58 or 68 of the Post Office Act 1953 has the right of trial by jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">If, before he commits the offence, an injunction is granted restraining him from committing an offence under those sections and he is brought before the civil courts for contempt, his guilt will be decided not by a jury but by a judge or judges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">If he is subsequently tried for the criminal offence, might not the finding of guilt by a judge or judges prejudice his trial?</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This question is not to my mind satisfactorily answered by saying that juries can be told to ignore certain matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It was suggested that this difficulty might be overcome by adjourning the proceedings for contempt until after the conclusion of the criminal trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">If that was done, the question might arise then as to the propriety of imposing a punishment in the contempt proceedings additional to that imposed on conviction for the same conduct in the criminal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">" 
 

Lord Diplock also cautioned against interference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He said (at 498-499): 
 
 "It is in my view appropriate [that an injunction to restrain a potential offender from committing a criminal offence] be used only in the most exceptional of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It is not accurate to describe it as preventative justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is a deterrent and punitive procedure; but this is characteristic too of the enforcement of criminal law through the ordinary courts of criminal jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The very creation by Parliament of a statutory offence constitutes a warning to potential offenders that if they are found guilty by a court of criminal jurisdiction of the conduct that is proscribed, they will be liable to suffer punishment up to a maximum authorised by the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">When a court of civil jurisdiction grants an injunction restraining a potential offender from committing what is a crime but not a wrong for which there is a redress in private law, this in effect is warning him that he will be in double jeopardy, for if he is found guilty by the civil court of committing the crime he will be liable to suffer punishment of whatever severity that court may think appropriate, whether or not it exceeds the maximum penalty authorised by the statute and notwithstanding that he will also be liable to be punished again for the same crime if found guilty of it by a court of criminal jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">" 
 

26 The second important English case is Imperial Tobacco Ltd v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Imperial Tobacco was being prosecuted for a scheme alleged by the Director of Public Prosecutions to be an unlawful lottery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It sought a declaration from the commercial court that the lottery was lawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The trial judge did not grant the declaration because he was of the view the scheme was both an unlawful lottery and an unlawful competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Court of Appeal was of the opposite opinion and granted the declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">On appeal to the House of Lords one of the issues that arose was whether a declaration should have been granted in light of the criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The House ruled that the civil court should not have granted any relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">On this aspect I propose to refer only to the speech of Viscount Dilhorne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He said (at 741-742):
 
 "That decision [that is the decision of the Court of Appeal], if it stands, will form a precedent for the Commercial Court and other civil courts usurping the functions of the criminal courts... 
 
 Such a declaration is no bar to a criminal prosecution, no matter the authority of the court which grants it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Such a declaration in a case such as the present one, made after the commencement of the prosecution, and in effect a finding of guilt or innocence of the offence charged, cannot found a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, though it may well prejudice the criminal proceedings, the result of which will depend on the facts proved and may not depend solely on admissions made by the accused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">If a civil court of great authority declares on admissions made by the accused that no crime has been committed, one can foresee the use that might be made of that at the criminal trial... 
 
 My Lords, it is not necessary in this case to decide whether a declaration as to the criminality or otherwise of future conduct can ever properly be made by a civil court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In my opinion it would be a very exceptional case in which it would be right to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In my opinion it cannot be right to grant a declaration that an accused is innocent after a prosecution has started.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 

27 The House of Lords confirmed its guarded approach in R (Rusbridger and Another) v Attorney-General [2003] UKHL 38 ; [2004] 1 AC 357.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The editor and senior journalists of The Guardian were conducting a press campaign advocating a republican form of government for England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">They sought a declaration that their campaign did not offend the Treason Felony Act 1848 (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">In truth there was no prospect of the editors and journalists being charged with any offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">That did not deter them from bringing the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The House of Lords said that the republican campaign did not offend the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Law Lords also discussed the circumstances in which a court would entertain a claim for declaratory relief on a question of criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">28 Lord Steyn dealt most extensively with this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">He said (at 367) that: "Normally, the seeking of a declaration in a civil case about the lawfulness of future conduct will not be permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">But in truly exceptional cases the court may allow such a claim to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">" He then laid down (at 367-368) the criteria that were to be satisfied to show that a case was exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The first was the existence of a genuine dispute about the subject matter, that is, whether there was likely to be a prosecution if the conduct were engaged in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The second was whether the case was "fact sensitive" or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">If the dispute involved a question of pure law a declaration might be appropriate but not if the facts were in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The third criterion was whether there was "a cogent public or private interest" which would be advanced by the grant of a declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">29 Lord Rodger approached the issue rather more generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He said (at 367):
 
 "A civil court can make such a declaration, although it would be right to do so only in a very exceptional case: Imperial Tobacco Ltd v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718, 742C-D per Viscount Dilhorne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The authorities do not spell out what constitutes a very exceptional case for these purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In ordinary cases people must take and act on their own legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">So, broadly speaking, a very exceptional case must be one where, unusually, the interests of justice require that the particular claimant should be able to obtain the ruling of the civil court before embarking on, or continuing with, a particular course of conduct which, on one view, might expose him to the risk of prosecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">" 
 

30 This trilogy of House of Lords cases show that whether or not a court will intervene may depend on whether the court is asked to consider past or future conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">If the court is asked to rule on future conduct and the issue involved is simply a question of law, the court is more likely to intervene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">On the other hand, it is less likely to act in relation to past conduct, especially if the facts are in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Moreover, if criminal proceedings are pending, the court will not intervene at all: R v DPP ex parte Camelot plc [1997] Admin LR 93.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The position is likely to be the same if criminal proceedings have not begun but are threatened: Rusbridger [2003] UKHL 38 ; [2004] 1 AC 357, 367.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">31 The position in Australia appears to be in a state of flux at least in company cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The early cases, including decisions of the High Court, followed the English principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">In recent times, however, there has been a shift away from that circumspect approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The reason for the shift must be examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">32 The traditional approach was referred to in Mutual Home Loans Fund of Australia Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1973] HCA 61 ; (1973) 130 CLR 103.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In this action the Attorney-General sought a declaration that an advertisement published by Mutual Home Loans constituted an invitation to the public to take up an interest in the corporation in contravention of the prospectus provisions of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The Attorney-General also sought an injunction to restrain future advertisements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Barwick CJ said (at 110-111):
 
 "No point was taken in this case that the declaration sought related to a criminal offence and the injunction to the commission of further criminal offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The ability of the Attorney-General to bring such a proceeding has been said to depend upon persistent breaches of the criminal law antecedent to the commencement of the suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">It would seem to be otherwise where the suit is to restrain breach of a statutory provision not enforceable by penalty or other criminal sanction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In such a case the Attorney-General may sue to protect the public interest in the due observance of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">" [citations omitted]
 

33 The next case is Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">That involved an application for a declaration that cabinet documents required to be produced on subpoena before a magistrate in committal proceedings were wrongly accorded Crown privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">There was also a cross-claim for a declaration that the facts alleged against the defendant did not constitute an offence in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">One argument raised in the High Court was that there was no power to grant the declarations sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The High Court held the power did exist and should be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Gibbs ACJ dealt with this issue in some detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">First of all he rejected an argument that for the purposes of granting declaratory relief in matters the subject of criminal proceedings a distinction should be drawn between regulatory offences and what I have described as true crime but what Gibbs ACJ described, rather more accurately, as crimes involving moral turpitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">He said that whenever a declaration is sought the circumstances must be carefully examined, especially if criminal proceedings have begun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">But he said that to intervene some special reason must exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">He put it this way (at 25): "[T]he circumstances must be exceptional to warrant the grant of relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">" In this connection Gibbs ACJ endorsed the observations of Jacobs P in Shapowloff v Dunn [1973] 2 NSWLR 468, 470 that a court will be reluctant to make a declaration in a matter which impinges directly upon the course of criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">However Gibbs CJ said (at 26) that the case before the High Court was "most exceptional".</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The proceedings in the Court of Petty Sessions at Queanbeyan were brought against a former prime minister and members of his cabinet and involved issues of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">34 Inglis v Moore (1979) 24 ALR 411 is a decision of the Full Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The plaintiff sought declarations that the defendants were guilty of a criminal conspiracy contrary to s 86 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The trial judge refused the declaration on the basis that the court should not entertain the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Full Court upheld the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">St John J said (at 414) that what was sought was "outside the ambit of declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">" He referred to Sankey v Whitlam and said (at 414), correctly, that the cases to which Gibbs ACJ referred in holding there was jurisdiction to intervene in criminal cases did "not reveal a single instance in which, in civil proceedings, the declaration sought has been one that certain actions of the defendants constituted a crime after finding facts in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">" All were cases in which there was no contest as to the facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">He went on to say (at 415) that: "Whether indictable offences have been committed is the concern of the criminal courts and are for trial there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">" Thus he concluded that the court could not intervene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Even if declaratory relief could as a matter of jurisdiction be granted St John J said (at 415): "a court would never exercise its discretion in favour of granting such relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">" He explained that "[w]hat, in effect, would happen if such an application were allowed to proceed would be that a defendant in civil proceedings would be found to have committed a crime without having the various advantages which are afforded him in a criminal trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">" 
 
35 Brennan and Davies JJ delivered a joint judgment in which they said (at 421): "Although it cannot be said that a declaration that conduct constitutes a crime will never be made... the discretion to make declarations of that kind is cautiously exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">" They referred with approval to what Lord Wilberforce said in Gouriet [1978] 1 AC 435, 481 paraphrasing Lord Eldon LC in Attorney-General v Cleaver (1811) 18 Ves Jun 211 [34 ER 297]: "These and other examples which can be given show that this jurisdiction [to grant a declaration] --- though proved useful on occasions --- is one of great delicacy and is one to be used with caution.</sentence>

36 Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) ex rel Corporate Affairs Commission [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121 is an important case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">There the High Court held it was appropriate to grant declarations that the defendants' conduct contravened ss 81, 82 and 83 of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Those sections, respectively, prohibited a person from offering any "interest" as defined to the public unless that offer was made by the company or a person authorised under the seal of the company, a statement in writing equivalent to a prospectus was issued and there was an approved deed in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">A contravention of each provision was a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">37 To appreciate the significance of this case it is necessary to know something of its history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Initially the Corporate Affairs Commission sought a declaration that the defendants' conduct had breached ss 81, 82 and 83 as well as an injunction to restrain future breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The case was tried by Helsham CJ in Eq on an agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Helsham CJ found in favour of the Commission and made the orders sought: Corporate Affairs Commission v Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd [1978] 1 NSWLR 150.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">There was an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The Court of Appeal agreed that there were breaches of ss 81, 82 and 83 but held that only an injunction should go it not being "a proper case for declarations which are little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction": Attorney-General (NSW) ex rel Corporate Affairs Commission v Australian Softwood Forests Pty Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 73, 76.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">38 Each side appealed to the High Court: the defendants on the basis that its scheme did not involve the creation of any interest as defined and the Attorney-General against the refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">By the time the appeal was heard the defendant was no longer interested in pursuing the scheme, so the injunction was not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The High Court ruled that declarations should have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Mason J (with whom Stephen J agreed) did not explain why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Neither did Wilson J. Gibbs CJ, who agreed generally in the reasons of Mason and Wilson JJ, did not explain why a declaration should be made, except to say that the Court of Appeal had erred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Murhpy J said (at 136) that both a declaration and an injunction were appropriate forms of relief to protect against the "most widespread and successful of the species of fraud known in Australia and elsewhere as 'the investment racket' [of] the forest or plantation variety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">" But, as the injunction was not pressed, the Court held that only the declaration should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">39 In Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596, 603 Young J said that by its decision in Australian Softwood Forests the High Court had given its "seal of approval" to the New South Wales practice of the Crown being entitled to obtain a declaration that a business person's conduct contravened the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">This is true provided two important points are kept steadfastly in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The first is that Australian Softwood Forests was argued from beginning to end on an agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The only issue that separated the parties was whether, on those facts, the defendants had offered to the public an "interest" within the meaning of the Act and were accordingly in breach of ss 81, 82 and 83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The second point is that there was no suggestion at any stage of the proceeding that criminal charges might be laid against the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The way the case was presented, and the arguments put in each court, showed that the Corporate Affairs Commission sought to vindicate its view of the defendants' conduct by civil rather than criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">This is not at all surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The legal issues raised were complex and, perhaps, more effectively dealt with by a civil rather than a criminal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">It is not possible, therefore, to take from Australian Softwood Forests that there had been a wholesale change to the circumstances in which a civil court will intervene in the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In any event, if the High Court had intended to change the law that dramatically it would have said so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">40 Still, there is a need to rethink the position in company cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The need arises because the Corporations Act now allows, indeed contemplates, the enforcement of most of its provisions (including those creating criminal offences) by a court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction granting relief by way of injunctions, what are known as "civil penalties" and other remedies appropriate to the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">To understand how this has come about it is necessary to go back to the 1970s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">41 A Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange was appointed on 19 March 1970 under the chairmanship of Senator Rae to inquire into the desirability of establishing a securities and exchange commission that would be empowered to act against improper practices in relation to the shares and securities of public companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The Committee's investigation revealed that corporate fraud, misconduct and incompetence were pervasive in a series of corporate collapses that occurred during the speculative boom in mining shares in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">In its report handed down on 18 July 1974 the Committee's major recommendation was that a national corporate regulator should be established in order to prohibit undesirable market practices and thereby restore public confidence in the stock market and protect those who invest in the securities of public companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">This led to the creation of the National Companies and Securities Commission (a predecessor of ASIC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The NCSC was granted broad investigatory powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Parliament wanted to avoid a situation where the regulator's investigation into misconduct had no practical benefits and amounted to nothing more than a public record of breaches: Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates , Senate, 5 December 1974, 3240-3242 (Lionel Murphy, Attorney-General).</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">As a result the NCSC was given the power to commence or intervene in proceedings in a wide range of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">42 It was also thought appropriate to give to the NCSC, as well as to persons affected by a contravention, power to obtain an injunction to prevent contraventions of the Companies Code and related legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The first attempt to introduce such a provision in the mid 1970s failed: see the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1974 (Cth) cl 274.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">But when the co-operative scheme legislation was enacted between 1979 and 1981 the power to grant an injunction was included in the Companies Code (s574) and the Securities Industry Code (s 149).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Code introduced a more far-reaching set of powers to deal with contraventions of that statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The powers included the right to restrain the disposal of shares, to restrain voting rights on shares and to restrain a company from making payment of any sums due in respect of shares (ss 45, 46 and 47).</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">43 The co-operative scheme legislation was replaced by the Corporations Law , which came into operation in 1990 and 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Instead of several statutes regulating the affairs of companies and dealings in securities there was, from that point, as there had been in the past, one statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The enforcement provisions that had been in the co-operative scheme legislation were found in s 1324 (injunctions) and ss 737-744 (orders for contraventions of the acquisition of shares provisions) of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">In the current legislation the successor provisions are ss 1324 (injunctions) and 1325A (remedial orders for contraventions of Chs 6 (takeovers), 6A (compulsory acquisitions and buy-outs), 6B (rights and liabilities in relation to Chs 6 and 6A) and 6C (information about ownership of listed companies and managed investment schemes)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">44 Later, the shift to civil enforcement received a sharp boost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">This resulted from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Senator Cooney, known as the Report on the Social and Fiduciary Duties and Obligations of Company Directors (1989).</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The report stated (at 190) that criminal penalties were a necessary means of enforcing the companies legislation for conduct that involves fraud and dishonesty and is "genuinely criminal in nature".</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The report recommended (at 191), however, that the companies legislation be amended to include "civil penalties" for breaches by directors where no criminality is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The result was the introduction by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 (Cth) of a civil penalty regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">This was a scheme by which certain breaches of the Corporations Law were to be dealt with by a court exercising civil jurisdiction operating alongside the criminal courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">45 Under the scheme certain provisions, most of which dealt with the duties and liabilities of corporate officers, were designated as "civil penalty provisions" (Corporations Law, s 1317DA; see now Corporations Act , s 1317E).</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The court was given power to declare that a person had contravened a civil penalty provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The power was mandatory where the court was satisfied a contravention had occurred (CL s 1317EA(2); CA s 1317E(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">A person who contravened a civil penalty provision was exposed to a number of "civil penalty orders" (CL ss 1317EA-1317EH; CA ss 1317E - 1317HA ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">If the contravener was dishonest and intended to gain an advantage or intended to deceive or defraud someone, he was also liable to be prosecuted in criminal proceedings (CL s 1317FA and sch 3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Although the same conduct could give rise to both civil penalties and criminal sanctions (CL s 1317EA(1)), civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings were, in most cases, mutually exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">This was because criminal proceedings could not be brought if civil penalty proceedings had already commenced (CL s 1317FB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Likewise civil penalty proceedings could not be brought after criminal proceedings had commenced, except in very limited circumstances (CL ss 1317GC and 1317GD).</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Effectively it was necessary to make a choice between civil penalties and criminal sanctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">46 The scheme was changed by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The principal change was that a criminal proceeding could now be commenced during the currency of a civil penalty proceeding (CL s 1317N; CA s 1317N) or after such proceedings had been disposed of, whatever the outcome (CL s 1317P; CA s 1317P).</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">And the criminal court was given priority over its civil counterparts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Thus, civil penalty proceedings would be stayed if criminal proceedings were begun (CL s 1317N; CA s 1317N).</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">There was, though, a practical limitation to the commencement of a criminal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Evidence of information given or documents produced by an individual in proceedings for a civil penalty was not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual (CL s 1317Q; CA s 1317Q).</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">The other side of the coin was that a civil penalty proceeding could not be brought if the offender was convicted of an offence (CL s 1317M; CA s 1317M).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">47 The orders that may now be made in a civil penalty proceeding, in addition to a declaration of contravention, are that the person pay a pecuniary penalty of up to $200,000 (s 1317G) and that the person pay compensation to a corporation or registered scheme that has suffered loss because of the contravention (ss 1317H and 1317HA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">If a declaration of contravention is made the court may also order that the person be disqualified from managing a corporation (s 206C).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">A declaration of contravention must specify the things mentioned in s 1317E(2), including identifying the person who contravened the relevant provision and describing the conduct that constituted the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The declaration is conclusive evidence of those things (s 1317F).</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">So, the declaration may be used to prove those things in other civil proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">48 To this point, the discussion has been about the way in which a court exercising its civil jurisdiction in a civil penalty proceeding is able to grant relief in company cases, that is supplemental to criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">It is also worthwhile making reference to the ever increasing range of civil remedies that may be granted by a civil court in the event of a breach of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Some, such as an order to disclose information or publish advertisements under s 1324B , apply only to certain kinds of breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Others, like the power to prohibit a person who contravened a provision of the Corporations Act from disposing of his assets under s 1323(1) , apply to contraventions of any provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Then there are the remedies available to a person who has suffered loss from a breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">For example: s 1325(5)(e) permits the recovery of damages resulting from a breach of a provision in Chs 5C (managed investment schemes), 6CA (continuous disclosure), 6D (fundraising) or Pt 7.10 (market misconduct and other prohibited conduct relating to financial products and financial services); ss 1317H and 1317HA allow the recovery of damages for a breach of a civil penalty provision; s 670B provides for compensation for loss caused by misstatements in or omissions from takeover documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">49 The expanding power of the court on its civil side to deal with criminal conduct made a clash with the criminal court inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Parliament was alert to the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Since 1981 there has been a provision in the companies legislation that civil proceedings are not to be stayed merely because the proceeding discloses or arises out of an offence (Companies Code s 543 ; CL s 1331 ; CA s 1331).</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Without such a provision courts might not allow a civil proceeding to go ahead until the criminal law had played itself out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">50 The current regime of corporate regulation is, as the Cooney Committee's report observed (at 190), characterised by a "pyramid of enforcement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The basic premise is that to deter breaches of the legislation, there should be various levels of enforcement that correspond to the seriousness of the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">There are three levels to this pyramid: civil remedies at the base, civil penalties in the middle and criminal sanctions at the top.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">But it is the court exercising its civil jurisdiction that is the primary means of enforcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Only the most serious contraventions now end up before a criminal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Nonetheless when a criminal proceeding is commenced the criminal court should be given (and in many cases is expressly given) priority over civil litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">51 The present case is one where the contraventions of the Corporations Act of which Mr Berlowitz has been accused may result in him being prosecuted for criminal offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">What should happen when a civil court is asked to make a declaration of contravention and to grant an injunction restraining future contraventions when a criminal trial is pending or threatened?</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">52 There are many cases where courts have granted a declaration that a person has contravened the Corporations Act and enjoined any further contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In all but two a criminal prosecution was not on the horizon; at least the possibility was not adverted to by the judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">In some cases the court explained the rationale for making the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The most common explanations were that ASIC's function as a public regulator made it appropriate to grant the relief or because it was in the public interest to make a declaration so that the illegal conduct bore the stamp of the courts' disapproval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">See eg: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 , [34]-[35] per Austin J ("The present proceedings have been brought by the public regulator to enforce the corporations and securities legislation... [The provisions setting out the objectives of the ASIC Act] imply that it is appropriate for the Commission to take civil proceedings for declaratory and injunctive relief in respect of past events, even if there is no risk of repetition, where the outcome may establish that the conduct complained of was wrongful (and thereby mark the Court's and the community's disapproval of it) and may deter other wrongdoers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It is appropriate for the Court to take these matters into account in the exercise of its discretion to grant or refuse such relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">"); Pegasus Leveraged Options 41 ACSR 561, 571 per Davies AJ ("[W]hen declarations are sought by a public authority such as ASIC, the declarations should be made if it is in the public interest to do so.</sentence>

<sentence id="s348">ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act, and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects.</sentence>

<sentence id="s352">53 There are some cases where there is no discussion of the principles upon which the court acted: see eg Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Hutchings (2001) 38 ACSR 387; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Young [2003] QSC 29 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 655; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 68 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Preston [2005] FCA 1805 ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2006] QCA 540.</sentence>

<sentence id="s357">He acknowledged there was jurisdiction to make the order but said that "[w]here the possibility of prosecution is open, it would, in my judgment, be contrary to the ordinary practice for the authority of this Court to be given to a declaration which, in substance, amounted to a declaration that a defendant had committed a crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">One should not make a declaration which might be falsified by a subsequent acquittal in proceedings between the same parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">" The judge did grant a restraining order as it was clear on the facts that the directors had aided their company's contraventions of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">55 The other case is Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fuelbanc Australia Ltd (2007) 25 ACLC 1230.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The case involved a petrol payment scheme where subscribers, by paying a joining fee and making upfront contributions of cash and so-called "barter units", were provided with a debit card to which a specified amount was deposited every week to purchase petrol at participating service stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">ASIC alleged that the scheme constituted an unregistered management investment scheme in breach of s 601ED and that the defendants conducted an unlicensed financial services business in breach of s 911A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">It sought an order that the scheme be wound-up as well as declarations, injunctions and other ancillary relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The defendants did not contest the facts upon which ASIC based its claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Nor did they oppose the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">But because counsel for ASIC could not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against the defendants he drew the court's attention to Intertax Holdings .</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Heerey J was not troubled by the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">He referred to the "consistent practice" in company cases of courts making declarations of criminal conduct, citing, in particular, Transphere , Sankey v Whitlam and Australian Softwood Forest among other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">56 I do not doubt that because the facts were not in dispute and the defendants were content for the case to go ahead an application of the traditional rules would not require the judge to stay the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Yet Heerey J thought that Intertax Holdings, if good law, stood in his way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">He expressed the view, however, that Intertax Holdings was wrongly decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">He explained (at 1235): 
 
 "While courts are still reluctant to grant declaratory relief on issues which are theoretical or hypothetical, the Intertax argument against the grant of declaratory relief is based on a hypothetical fact, indeed a hypothesis upon a hypothesis --- that there will be a prosecution and that such prosecution will result in an acquittal" [citations omitted].</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">
 

57 For my own part I do not regard this criticism as justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Intertax Holdings was different from the case that confronted Heerey J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In the former case the facts were in dispute and the defendants did not want the facts to be determined in a civil action in advance of a criminal trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">In addition, one must not lose sight of the fact that one object of the caution rule is to protect the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">58 I would sum up the position as I see it as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Ordinarily, a civil court should not intervene in those circumstances unless its failure to do so will result in irreparable injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">That strict rule need not be applied if the case involves undisputed facts and the issue raised gives rise to a question of pure law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Then a declaration can be a very useful remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">As Barwick CJ said in Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 19 ; (1972) 126 CLR 297, 305 that is the kind of case "which contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">"
 
59 The case at bar is a particularly good example of one in which the court should not interfere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">First of all, a criminal prosecution is on the cards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Second, the facts are not agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">On the contrary, if there is to be a trial, the Crown would be put to its proof on most issues and some of the "facts" to be asserted by the Crown are likely to be in contest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Third, there is potential for an adverse impact on the jury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The civil case will be decided on evidence that, for the most part, will not be available to the prosecutor in a criminal trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Imagine what would happen if a jury discovers that a civil court has ruled that Mr Berlowitz' conduct is illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The judge presiding over the criminal trial will be obliged to tell the jury to leave that out of account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">It is axiomatic in our courts that jurors can be trusted to leave out of their consideration things that they are instructed to leave out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Yet many regard this kind of instruction as little more than wishful thinking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Perhaps the jurors will have explained to them that the judge who made the ruling acted on evidence not before the jury and that in any event a lower standard of proof was required in the civil court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Whether those instructions will result in a fair criminal trial may be strongly doubted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Last, but by no means least, is the falsification point made by Fryberg J which, if it occurs, will bring the law into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">60 For the foregoing reasons I decline to entertain, on a final basis, the application for declaratory and injunctive relief against Mr Berlowitz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">I am, however, prepared to stand the matter over until a final decision is taken as regards a criminal prosecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">If Mr Berlowitz is to be charged I would dismiss this proceeding against him and leave it to the criminal court to decide his fate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">On the other hand, if the decision is made not to lay charges, this case can be brought back on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">61 I will hear the parties on what interlocutory orders, if any, should be made in the meantime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">There will, in any event, be an order that ASIC pay the fifteenth defendant's costs as a result of the discontinuance of the claim against that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">I certify that the preceding sixty-one (61) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
