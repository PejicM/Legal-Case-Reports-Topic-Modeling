<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant, Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd, is registered as the proprietor of a design under the Designs Act 1906 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The design is in respect of a particular style of mattress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Registration was effected on 2 September 1996 with a priority date of 26 July 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Chiropedic sues the respondent, Radburg Pty Ltd, for infringement of its design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Radburg denies infringement and also cross-claims for the cancellation of the registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">One of the grounds upon which it relies to support its cross-claim is that the design was not novel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">With the consent of the parties this issue is to be determined before the trial on infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 It is common ground that between 20 and 23 July 1996 (that is, before the priority date) Chiropedic exhibited a mattress to which the design was applied at the National New Products Parade Fair that was held at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The fair had been organised by the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia (Vic/Tas) (FIAA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The publication at the fair will invalidate the registration for want of novelty unless s 47 of the Designs Act is attracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Although this section does not appear in the current legislation, the validity of the design in suit is to be determined under the provisions of the superseded statute: Designs Act 2003 (Cth), s 151(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 As a general rule, any prior disclosure of a design destroys its novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There are a limited number of exceptions to this rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Under the 1906 Act one of the exceptions was found in s 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The section, along with the heading below which the section appeared, provided:
 
 "Exhibiting of designs at official or international exhibitions
 
 
 
 47(1) The fact that a design, or any article to which a design has been applied, has been exhibited at an official or officially recognized international exhibition, or that a description of a design has been published during the holding of such an exhibition, shall not prejudice or prevent the registration of the design or invalidate the monopoly therein, if the application for the registration of the design is made within six months after the opening of the exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A certificate by the Minister that an exhibition is an official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition, shall, for the purposes of this section, be conclusive evidence that the exhibition is an official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition, as the case requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">" 
 
 
 

4 Essentially, the section gave a six month grace period in the case of disclosure at an exhibition that is an "official or officially recognized international exhibition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Just what that means, though, is not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">First of all, it is not clear whether the exhibitions at which a non-prejudicial disclosure could be made were: (1) an official international exhibition and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition; or (1) an official exhibition (whether international or not) and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Secondly, each of the words or expressions "official", "officially recognized" and "international" have more than one meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">5 Despite the vigorous protests by Mr McGowan SC, the starting point for the resolution of these problems of construction is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property which was opened for signature on 20 March 1883.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Minister who introduced the Bill for the Designs Act 1906 said that cl 47 had been taken from the Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883 (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Perhaps he had been misled by the marginal note to cl 47, which referred to s 58 of the UK Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In fact, the corresponding section in England was s 57, but its wording was quite different from that of s 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Section 57 permitted prior publication at an industrial or international exhibition provided it had been certified by the Board of Trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 However that may be, it is clear s 47 was based on Art 11(1) of the Paris Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Article 11(1) provides: 
 
 "The country of the Union shall, in conformity with their domestic legislation, grant temporary protection to patentable inventions, utility models, industrial designs and trade marks, in respect of goods exhibited at official or officially recognized international exhibitions held in the territory of any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">"
 

 I acknowledge that Australia did not become a party to the Paris Convention until 1925.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Nonetheless, the conclusion that the operative language in s 47 is copied from Art 11(1) is inescapable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The alternative, that the similarity in language is mere coincidence, is one I simply cannot accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">7 It is necessary to go back to Art 11 because of the rule that when a statute incorporates a treaty as part of domestic law, it is presumed that Parliament intended to import into domestic law a provision that has the same effect as the provision in the treaty: Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168, 265; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225, 231, 240, 251-252, 272-273, 292.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">8 For the purposes of interpreting the expression "official or officially recognized international exhibitions" in Art 11(1) it is permissible to have regard to preparatory work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">While this kind of material can be used only to a limited extent to construe a domestic statute ( Acts Interpretation Act 1906 (Cth), s 15AB), in the international field "the practice of resorting to preparatory work is widespread": McNair, Law of Treaties (1938) at 412.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">For treaties which enter into force after 27 January 1980 see the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties , Arts 31 and 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 The idea of a convention to deal with industrial property was first raised at the Universal Exhibition held in Vienna in 1873.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Vienna Exhibition had been planned for 1859, but the war in France and the Austrian struggle for power with Prussia intervened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Then the Lower Austrian Trade Association proposed an international exhibition and it was approved by the Emperor, Franz Joseph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Vienna Exhibition had over 1700 exhibitors from more than 30 countries: J Findling (ed), Historical Dictionary of World's Fairs and Exhibitions, 1851-1988 (1990); J Allwood, The Great Exhibitions (1977).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">10 Five years later, at the Paris Exhibition (another major international exhibition this time organised by the French Government), it was agreed that a permanent commission would be established to draft the Paris Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The main object of the Paris Convention was to secure to foreigners the same protection for industrial property (patents, designs and trademarks) as was enjoyed by foreigners in their country of nationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">This was the so-called principle of equal protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">11 Of concern to a number of delegates was the risk of piracy of works on display at international exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Some States had passed laws to prevent this kind of piracy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">For example, the purpose of s 3 of the Designs Act 1850 (UK) (13 &amp; 14 Vict, 104) was to provide protection against piracy for foreign exhibitors at the Great Exhibition of 1851, sometimes called the Crystal Palace Exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It gave them the opportunity of finding "either manufacturers or capitalists" to take up their invention or design before going to the trouble and expense of obtaining registration: Minutes of Evidence of Select Committee of House of Lords to Consider the Bill for the Designs Act 1850, 12 March 1851, at 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In May 1855, France enacted similar legislation which provided protection for industrial inventions and manufacturing designs admitted to the Paris International Exhibition of 1855: Y Plasseraud and F Savignon, Paris 1883 Genes&#277; Du Droit Unioniste Des Brevets (1981) at 98.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">12 Article 11 required contracting States to enact legislation that would grant temporary protection to industrial property exhibited at certain exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The article was drafted in general terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It was intended to do no more than lay down the broad subject matter of legislation that contracting States were to introduce, leaving it to those States to decide upon the precise means of achieving the stated ends: Professor G Bodenhausen, Guide to the Application of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Properties (1968) at 149 (Bodenhausen).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 The discussions of the delegates involved in the drafting of the Convention suggests that the "exhibitions" referred to in Art 11 were all to be "international" in character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">For example, the Italian delegate, M Indelli, stated during the 12 November 1880 drafting session that although it might be difficult for treaty States to amend domestic legislation to give effect to the principle of reciprocal and equal protection required by Art 11 (which was at the time denominated Art 9):
 
 "it is to be observed that one must carefully consider the issue because the Exhibitions [within the meaning of Art 11], which are international events, need to be protected, and protected equally, so that there are no longer some countries privileged over others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">" 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Similarly, the Presiding delegate, M Bozerian of France, made the following comment during a debate in the same session on how specific the provisions of Art 11 should be read:
 
 "[A]n Exhibition [within the meaning of Art 11] is a non-recurring, transient event which only takes place every 8 or 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">"
 

 The French delegate M Jagerschmidt noted during the 12 March 1883 drafting session, in response to the Dutch delegate's reservations to accepting Art 11 in light of the fact they had no patent law and thus would not be in a position to give domestic effect to the provisions of Art 11: 
 
 "[I]t is unlikely that another international exhibition will take place in the near future like the one which is going to take place in Amsterdam [the International and Colonial Exhibition held from 1 May---31 October 1883]; until such time the Government of the Netherlands certainly will not have the opportunity to apply Article 11 even if it does accept the Article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">" 
 

14 I will not belabour the point with the quotation of additional extracts, but the net effect of these and similar statements found in the preparatory work is to make it clear that the drafters had in mind the indivisible concept of an "international exhibition" (whether official or officially recognized), not a binary concept of "exhibition" which might either be an "official international exhibition" on the one hand or an "officially recognized local exhibition" on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Moreover, the drafters understood "international exhibitions" as being infrequent, large-scale and multinational events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">15 It is my view, then, that in the expression "official or officially recognized international exhibition" the words "official" and "officially recognized" each modify "international exhibition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">If Mr McGowan's reading were correct Art 11 would not include "official international exhibitions" even though they were precisely the type of exhibitions being discussed by the delegates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">16 The 1883 Convention was also concluded in French, that text also being authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is permissible to have regard to the French text in the case of ambiguity or obscurity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The French version of Art 11(1) reads: 
 
 "Les pays de l'Union accorderont, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; leur legislation int&eacute;rieure, une protection temporaire aux inventions brevetables, aux m&#335;d&eacute;les d'utilit&eacute;, aux dessins ou mod&eacute;les industriels ainsi qu'aux marques de fabrique ou de commerce, pour les produits qui figureront aux expositions internationales officielles ou officiellement reconnues organis&eacute;es sur le territoire de l'un deux.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">"
 

 Mr McGowan says that in the French text it is clear that "expositions interationales officielles ou officiellement reconnues" means official exhibitions or officially recognized international exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In this connection he adopts the argument of a French lawyer who was asked to comment on the text.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Regrettably, the French lawyer was informed of Mr McGowan's preferred construction of Art 11 before putting forward his views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Although hard to make out, the lawyer's argument is as follows:
 
 "In the expression, 'expositions internationales officielles ou officiellement reconnues' the word 'ou' ('or') qualifies the exhibition as being neither 'an international official exhibition' or 'an officially recognised exhibition'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">This is because 'reconnues' has been conjugated from the verb 'reconna&icirc;tre' ('to recognise') which can be conjugated with the auxiliary 'to be' and, therefore, when taking the form of a past participle, takes the form of the object of the sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In this case 'reconna&icirc;tre' has been conjugated in the feminine case [sic] and plural form and must therefore be a reference to the word 'exhibition'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">'Exhibition' in French being a feminine noun and, in this case, it is plural.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">"
 

17 The basis for the contention that the word "reconnues" modifies "expositions" and not "expositions interationales" is not as clear as the lawyer would have it to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">For one thing, regardless of whether "reconnues" modifies "expositions" or "expositions internationales", it will be declined (the past participle is being used as an adjective, not a verb, and thus it is declined rather than conjugated) in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">For another thing, the structure of the sentence is not phrased so that "internationales" modifies "officielles" but rather so that it modifies "expositions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">On the lawyer's construction "internationales" is not attached to a noun.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I do not accept that the French text suggests a different construction of Art 11(1) from the one I prefer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">18 In any event, a problem with the French lawyer's interpretation of Art 11 is that, even on its own terms, it does not support the interpretation favoured by Mr McGowan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">As noted, Mr McGowan submits that the English version of Art 11 to be interpreted to read "official exhibition or officially recognized international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">" The French lawyer, on the other hand, interprets the French text to read "official international exhibition or officially recognized exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">" If each view is correct the two authentic treaty texts do not agree as to which type of exhibition must be international.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Established international law, codified in Art 33 of the Vienna Convention, requires that "when a comparison of the authentic texts [of a treaty] discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In this case, the only meaning which would reconcile the French and English texts is one in which "official or officially recognized" is understood to modify both "international" and "exhibition", so that the whole phrase reads "official international exhibition or officially recognized international exhibition" in both languages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">19 As regards the meaning of "official" the background to the Paris Convention suggests that it was a reference to State sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">All the great exhibitions of Europe, beginning with the Great Exhibition of 1851, had been organised or financially supported by a government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">For example, the Great Exhibition was managed by a Royal Commission chaired by Prince Albert and included the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The exhibitions in Dublin (1853), Paris (1885), London (1862), Dublin (1865) and Paris (1867) were also government run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The exceptions were the exhibitions held in the United States, such as the New York Exhibition of 1853-1854 and the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">They were privately organised but were hosted by cities which bore some of the not inconsiderable cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">20 Prima facie, then, s 47(1) is to be given the meaning that I have attributed to Art 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">But the prima facie meaning can be displaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">There are several features of s 47 which suggest that the prima facie meaning has been displaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The first is s 47(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">There one finds, twice used, the expression "official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">" This suggests that "official" and "officially recognized" are to be understood as modifying only "exhibition" and not the compound "international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">" It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the language of s 47(2) controls the construction of s 47(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It would be absurd to provide for a certificate from the Minister under s 47(2) that an exhibition was an "official exhibition" if such an exhibition were not covered by s 47(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">21 The second feature is the heading to s 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Ordinarily, the section headings in an Act form no part of the statute: Acts Interpretation Act, s 13(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">But, where, as here, a provision is ambiguous, the heading to the section may be looked at to resolve the ambiguity: Acts Interpretation Act, s 15AB(1)(b)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The heading to s 47 reads "official or international exhibitions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The disjunctive juxtaposition of "official" and "international" supports the view that an "official exhibition" is distinct from an "international exhibition", rather than a type of international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">22 The final point is that on the second reading of the Bill, the Minister said of s 47 that it covered "official or international exhibitions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It is true that the Minister was incorrect as to the source of s 47 --- the 1883 Act refers to an "industrial or international exhibition" and the 1850 Act to a "public exhibition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Nonetheless, the Minister's statement supports the view that Parliament understood the phrase "official or officially recognized international exhibition" to mean both officially recognized international exhibitions and non-international yet official exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">23 If the construction of s 47(1) is controlled by s 47(2) the result is not so "incongruous" or "irrational" as would require a court to correct an obvious legislative error: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1, 21-22; Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297, 305, 311, 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is evident that s 47 is a remedial or beneficial provision offering a registration grace period in order to encourage (or not deter) the participation of designers in exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It should, therefore, be construed broadly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Moreover it is, I suppose, possible that parliamentary counsel who drafted s 47 intended to broaden the scope of the European prior publication exception so as to further encourage designers to test the viability of their designs prior to registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The protection given by Art 11(1) is very narrow and many think it should be broader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">See V Di Cataldo, 'From the European Patent to a Community Patent' 8 Columbia Journal of European Law 19, 24-25 (2002); K M Curesky, 'International Patent Harmonization Through the WIPO: An Analysis of the US Proposal to Adopt a "First-to-File" Patent System' 21 Law and Policy in International Business 289, 298-99 (1989) (noting that the novelty requirements of continental patent and design law have been criticised as overly strict, particularly in comparison with US laws allowing a general registration grace period without regard to the form or manner of prior publication).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">24 The result is that s 47(1) should be read so that the publication of a design at either (1) an official exhibition or (2) an officially recognized international exhibition is not a novelty-destroying prior publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">25 I do not, however, accept that an official exhibition includes an exhibition organised by a private person or body, such as a private trade association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">First, it does not conform with the meaning of Art 11(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Second, it lacks any limiting principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">If "official" is taken to implicate any body having officers (as Mr McGowan would have it), an exhibition organised by a large private corporation, which of course has officers, might qualify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">So also might exhibitions organised by small corporations or neighbourhood associations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">At a minimum, the approach proposed by Mr McGowan would entangle the courts in difficult issues of fact while robbing designers and exhibitors of certainty as to whether a particular exhibition did or did not qualify for s 47(1) protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The net effect would be to encourage litigation without concomitantly encouraging designers to exhibit or test their designs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">26 The only suggestion that "official" is not intended to refer to the involvement of a government is in Phillips, Protecting Designs: Law on Litigation (1994).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There (at 287) the author suggests with regard to s 47 that "arguably an exhibition organised by [a] relevant trade or industry association will come within [the] ambit" of those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The history to which I have referred does not bear this out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The use of the word "official" is designed, in my opinion, to draw a distinction between public and privately organised exhibitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It refers to an exhibition that is organised by a government: see Oxford English Dictionary definition of "official" at [4a].</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The "government" may be federal or state or a local government authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">27 In the instant case, the fair was organized by an industry association, the FIAA, and not by a government authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Accordingly, it cannot qualify as an official exhibition for the purposes of s 47(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 This still leaves open the possibility that the fair was an "officially recognized international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" "Officially recognized" can be defined in opposition to "official," which effectively means "officially organized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" An exhibition will be "officially recognized" if it is recognized by the federal or state government or any local government authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Two obvious indicia of governmental recognition are: (1) the provision of public funds to fund the exhibition, particularly if given upon terms and conditions; and (2) the open participation of one or more ranking government officials at the opening, closing, or other formal ceremony or proceeding of the exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">While there will be other indicia of government recognition, it is neither necessary nor possible to provide an exhaustive list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The best indicia is that which may be readily ascertained ex ante from public information and thus provide prospective exhibitors with sufficient certainty as to whether an exhibition could qualify for protection under s 47(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">29 In the present case, the fair was funded by a $200,000 grant from the Victorian government upon various conditions, including that the exhibition be opened to the general public for at least one day and that no goods be sold to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The fair was opened by the Minister for Small Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">On these facts, it is clear that the fair was an officially recognized exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">30 The final issue is whether the fair was "international".</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The ordinary and natural meaning of "international" is "of or relating to different nations or their citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">" Mr McGowan submitted, based on this definition, that an exhibition could be characterized as international either by virtue of the nationality of the goods and exhibitors or by virtue of the nationality of the visitors to the exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Samargis, on the other hand, put the argument that the international character of an exhibition can be determined only by reference to the goods and exhibitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">31 Mr Samargis has the better argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">First, his approach is supported by what little authority there is: see Bodenhausen at 151.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Second, his argument has the great virtue of certainty and clarity --- any prospective design registrant or exhibitor would be able to ascertain with a glance at an exhibition guide or list of exhibitors the nationality of the goods and exhibitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">By contrast, lists of visitors and their nationalities are not so easily or publicly found, if at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">And one must not lose sight of the fact that the exhibitions which were the backdrop to the Paris Convention were international because of their exhibitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">32 In my view an exhibition is international if there are foreign exhibitors exhibiting foreign goods (with foreign being defined as a nationality other than that in which the exhibition is hosted).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">33 Mr Samargis also submitted that for an exhibition to be truly international it requires exhibitors from at least three nations (ie, the host country and two others).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">This is a departure from the ordinary dictionary definition of international.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">But it is an approach that sits comfortably with Professor Bodenhausen's views that for an exhibition to be international "it must include the exhibition of goods coming from foreign countries": Bodenhausen at 151.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">34 Even if Mr Samargis' approach is wrong, and an exhibition can be "international" where there are exhibitors from only two countries (the host and one other), the FIAA fair held in Melbourne in 1996 was not an international affair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">There were 257 exhibitors whose products were on display.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Out of the total exhibitors, 250 manufacturers were Australian and the balance were from New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Without wishing to be disrespectful, the New Zealand contingent was inconsequential, relatively speaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Whatever be the characteristics of an "international exhibition" they are not met by an exhibition which is essentially an Australian exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In my view, for an exhibition to be international in character there must at least be a significant foreign presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">35 I should explain what I mean by "significant foreign presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">" First, the quantitative presence of foreign exhibitors, both in relative and absolute terms (here 7 exhibitors out of 257), is a factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The greater the foreign presence, the more likely it is that an exhibition will be an "international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">" Second, the quality of the foreign exhibitors is a factor; and by "quality" I mean both the geographic location and the importance of the foreign state(s) in the relevant industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">For example, if an exhibition is held in Canada and the only foreign exhibitors or goods are from the United States (or if, as in this case, the exhibition is held in Australia and the only foreign exhibitors are from New Zealand), the exhibition is more likely to be a "regional exhibition" rather than an "international exhibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">" On the other hand, if a fashion exhibition is held in Australia and the only foreign exhibitors are from Italy or France (or, for example, if a computer software exhibition is held in the US and the only foreign exhibitors are from India or China), the exhibition is likely to be an "international exhibition" due to the importance of those countries in the fashion design field (or computer industry) and the geographic separation between the States involved.</sentence>
