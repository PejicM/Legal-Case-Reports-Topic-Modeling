 Introduction 
 
1 The appellant is an Indian national who was born on 22 July 1980 at Tamil Nadu in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He is of Tamil ethnicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 28 July 2000 the appellant entered Australia under a business visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He was travelling with an Indian passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 24 August 2000 he lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs refused his application on 7 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 23 November 2000 the appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Following a hearing on 24 May 2002 the Tribunal, on 31 May 2002, affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Tribunal's decision was the subject of a judicial review application to the Federal Court on 23 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 9 October 2002 the Court dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">However, the appellant appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court on 29 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 23 May 2003 the appeal was allowed, the decision of the Tribunal set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 On 29 September 2003 the second Tribunal, reconsidering the application for review, affirmed the original delegate's decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant then sought judicial review of that decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 24 January 2006 Barnes FM heard the application for judicial review and delivered judgment on the same day dismissing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant was ordered to pay the Minister's costs fixed in the amount of $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 13 February 2006 the appellant filed a notice of appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 10 May 2006 the appellant filed a motion seeking leave to further amend the grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The draft further amended notice of appeal sought leave to advance some grounds of appeal which did not reflect grounds of judicial review raised before the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">5 For the reasons that follow, although I have decided to allow the amendment of the notice of appeal, none of the grounds of appeal have any merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">They do not disclose any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal and the appeal will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Claims in Support of the Original Application for a Protection Visa 
 
6 In a statutory declaration which accompanied his application for a protection visa the appellant said that he had studied at National Higher Secondary School at Mannargudi until 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He graduated with a 'Diploma in Automobile' (sic) from the Shanmugha Polytechnic at Vallam in Thanjavur District.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">While a student, presumably at the Polytechnic, he said he became the College Students' Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He organised demonstrations in support of Sri Lankan Tamils because he believed that they were persecuted by the Sri Lankan government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 Because of his work at the College the appellant was contacted by the Tamil Tigers, members of the Tamil organisation known as LTTE, and asked to help them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He said that he readily accepted that obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He rented a house for Tamil Tigers where they could stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">After he finished his studies he worked for them collecting blood and purchasing clothes, diesel and medicines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">8 Tamil Tigers (presumably those staying at the house which he had rented) were arrested by police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appellant was also arrested 'on suspicion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">While in police custody at Thanjavur he was kept 'half naked and tortured'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He claimed that false charges were framed against him and that he was locked up for a month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">After he was released he went to Vedaranyam and tried to start a new life with some relatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However during this time his parents and sisters were constantly threatened by police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 On another occasion Tamil Tigers trying to smuggle diesel and medicine were arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Police suspected him also and arrested him again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">He was taken into custody and chained by both arms and interrogated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He claimed that police forced him to sign blank papers and asked him to confess to false charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He refused and was beaten cruelly and put into gaol at Cuddalore for three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Again he was released and then went to Mumbai and did casual work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Because of what he described as 'continuous torture' by the police and intimidation of the Tigers he decided to leave India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He obtained a visa to Australia with the help of some friends and on 28 July 2000 arrived in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">He said: 
 
 'I strongly believe that the Indian Police framed up new charges against me and involved me in old and new cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Therefore I appeal to you to sympathetically consider and grant me refugee status in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">' 
 

The statutory declaration did not set out any dates on which the appellant was arrested or the periods that elapsed between various incidents and movements referred to in the declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The First Tribunal's Decision 
 
10 In the reasons for decision of the first Tribunal, which were published on 31 May 2002, it was accepted that the appellant was sympathetic to the cause of the Tamil Tiger organisation, the LTTE, and that he had agreed to work for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He was well aware that the LTTE was a banned organisation in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The first Tribunal accepted that he was arrested and questioned by police and that during that time he was subject to beatings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It also accepted that within a few months, namely November 1999, he was again arrested on suspicion of being involved with the LTTE and held for a period of three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It was also 'prepared to accept' that during that time he was subjected to some mistreatment by police during interrogation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">11 The first Tribunal found that the appellant was arrested and detained on the two occasions mentioned for suspected breaches of the Indian Penal Code, a law of general application in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was satisfied that whilst he may have suffered some mistreatment by police in the past, and might fear some further mistreatment in the future either by the police or the LTTE, what he had suffered in the past was not persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It found that his mistreatment by police arose from their reasonable suspicions of his involvement in criminal activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The first Tribunal said (at [60]): 
 
 'While their methods may have been suspect, I am satisfied that the police were involved in the legitimate exercise of their police duties and were not subjecting the Applicant to persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I am also satisfied that subsequent inquiries by police about the Applicant of his family were also a legitimate exercise by police of their policing function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">' 
 

12 Even if what he had suffered before coming to Australia had been for a Convention reason the Tribunal was not satisfied that what the appellant had suffered in Tamil Nadu before his departure was serious enough to amount to persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">There was nothing of the nature of 'serious harm and systematic and discriminatory conduct' in the actions of police in arresting and interrogating the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Judicial Review of the First Tribunal's Decision 
 
13 On 9 October 2002 Wilcox J dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review of the first Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He did so on the basis that the privative clause provision, s 474 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), precluded the Court from intervening, even if jurisdictional error had been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">His Honour was of the view nevertheless that the first Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The most obvious example was its failure to deal with the appellant's claim that he was at risk of persecution by the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">14 His Honour said that the first Tribunal's conclusion that police had been involved in the legitimate exercise of their duties and did not subject the appellant to persecution for Convention reasons, was 'startling'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It was not apparent why the Tribunal member thought that police would, in the legitimate exercise of their duties, hold a person for weeks, or months, at a time, without charge, and assault him during detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Nevertheless his Honour held that the first Tribunal's conclusion was one of fact and not susceptible to review in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">As to the conclusion that the treatment or mistreatment received by the appellant did not amount to persecution within the meaning of the Convention, his Honour held that although he found it a startling conclusion, it was a conclusion of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">15 His Honour's decision was made before the judgment of the High Court in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. which held that decisions under the Migration Act were amenable to judicial review for jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">An appeal from his Honour's decision to the Full Court was allowed on 20 May 2003 --- NAPL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 94.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The decision of the High Court in Plaintiff S157/2002 had been delivered between the time at which Wilcox J delivered his judgment and the time at which the Full Court delivered its judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">16 The respondent Minister, before the Full Court, did not challenge the finding by Wilcox J that there had been jurisdictional error of law on the part of the first Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The decision of Wilcox J was set aside, as was the decision of the first Tribunal of 31 May 2002 and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Reasons for Decision of the Second Tribunal 
 
17 The second Tribunal, constituted by a different Tribunal member, reviewed the claims made by the appellant and the evidence relevant to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It referred to the statutory declaration dated 24 August 2000 which had accompanied the original protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">18 The appellant's claims at the hearing before the first Tribunal were summarised by the second Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">At that hearing on 24 May 2002 the appellant said he feared he would be killed if he returned to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He feared the police because he had opposed the police department in the past and supported the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He now also feared the LTTE because he felt that if he were arrested the LTTE would be concerned that he might reveal what he knew of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He told the first Tribunal that he had been approached by the LTTE to assist them in about May 1999 and had rented a house for them in about June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">He was first arrested in September 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">19 The appellant had told the first Tribunal that he was never put before a court or put on trial and that no sentence was imposed on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">During the first one month detention he had been beaten, not given regular meals and not provided with proper water or clothes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">20 The second Tribunal referred to the appellant's evidence in the first Tribunal hearing that he had been arrested at the end of November 1999 and held for three months and that the police had not preferred charges against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He had claimed, before the first Tribunal, that he had not been subjected to beatings on that occasion but had suffered mental distress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">He had not been arrested again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">His protection visa application had made a reference to 'continuous torture'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Asked about this he had told the first Tribunal that the police had approached his family on occasions asking about his whereabouts and threatening family members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">21 The appellant had told the first Tribunal that he had stopped helping the LTTE because of the torture inflicted on him by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The LTTE had not accepted this and had asked him to provide help which he declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">He was having trouble from both the police and the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">He agreed with a proposition put to him by the first Tribunal that he had been arrested because he was suspected of breaches of laws which applied to everybody in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He also agreed that it was not surprising that the police took a continuing interest in him because of his past involvement with the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">22 The appellant had told the first Tribunal that the LTTE would take revenge against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The fact that he no longer wanted to help them would be seen as a betrayal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Wherever he went in India they would seek him out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">While he had no difficulties leaving India and acknowledged that upon his return he might not have problems with the police, he would have trouble with the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Were he to approach the police for assistance he feared that officers who supported the LTTE might inform on him to the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">23 The appellant had agreed with a suggestion made by the first Tribunal that any mistreatment he suffered was because of his involvement in criminal activity in Tamil Nadu and not for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He had said however that he did not know at the time that what he was doing was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">His real problem was with the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">His life was in danger and Australia should give protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">24 The second Tribunal referred to the appellant's oral testimony before it on 17 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He told the second Tribunal that while he had obtained a business visa to come to Australia his real purpose had been to escape mistreatment experienced in India at the hands of the LTTE and the Indian police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He had worked at casual jobs in fruit shops in India and, while not employed in Australia at the time of lodging his protection visa application, he had since obtained work here in a food processing company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">25 The second Tribunal noted that the appellant's passport showed a departure stamp from Chennai airport in July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It asked the appellant whether he had experienced any difficulties in leaving India openly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It put to him that independent country information indicated that a person of interest to the Indian authorities, for example due to an outstanding charge, would not be able to leave in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The appellant said that he had come to Australia to attend a Hindu religious ceremony and had been dressed in special clothing with a group of similarly attired people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">He did not respond to the second Tribunal's further comment that despite being part of a religious group and dressed like its members, he had been able to depart India openly and in his own name without difficulties from the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">26 The appellant told the second Tribunal that a ceasefire had occurred in Sri Lanka between the government and the LTTE and had been in place for over 18 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Negotiations, complex and contentious, continued and there appeared to be some movement towards agreement on an autonomous region for Tamils in Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">27 The appellant said that the LTTE regarded the negotiations as unsatisfactory having regard to the rights that it had demanded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In the appellant's view the problems in Sri Lanka had not come to an end and there would not be a solution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In further discussion the Tribunal suggested that there had now been an absence of fighting for a considerable period and that the LTTE had dropped the crucial demand for an independent Tamil state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The appellant said the LTTE wanted to end the loss of lives and believed that the peace talks could lead to a solution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">However the Sri Lankan government was refusing to accept its demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">28 Asked why the LTTE needed his continuing assistance, the appellant said that they needed it to maintain a presence in Tamil Nadu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The second Tribunal noted that the LTTE in Tamil Nadu had been able to survive for the three years the appellant had been in Australia without the assistance he had previously provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The appellant said nevertheless he would be asked for help on his return and would be subjected to retribution by the LTTE for having ceased to help them before his departure from India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">As to the availability of police assistance with respect to attacks or threats by the LTTE, the appellant said he had not sought such assistance because the police were aware of his former assistance to the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">29 The Tribunal found that on two occasions in 1999 the appellant had been arrested and held in custody and interrogated by police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">However it held that while it was plausible that he might have suffered 'unpleasant treatment' that treatment did not amount to serious harm or mistreatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">30 The second Tribunal considered the appellant's claim that he was able to leave India only because he hid himself in a Hindu religious group was unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It concluded, on the basis of his testimony at the hearing, that he was able to leave India unhindered despite independent country information suggesting some capacity by Indian authorities to impede departure by persons wanted by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">31 The second Tribunal referred to the state of hostilities between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It took account of the peace process in Sri Lanka under which, since late 2001, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government had ceased hostilities and moved towards a settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It cited three documents in support of this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The first was from a BBC News World Edition item 'Timeline: Sri Lanka'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">This stated (at [51]): 
 
 'The election of December 2001 was narrowly won by the United National Party led by Ranil Wikramasinghe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In February 2002, following talks sponsored by Norway, the new government signed a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE, and in September a first round of talks began in Thailand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Prisoners of war were exchanged and the government lifted the ban on the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">' 
 

32 The second was a report from the Sunday Observer of 27 October 2002 (at [51]): 
 
 'The ceasefire of December 2001 has now held for almost two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">About 200,000 displaced people have returned to their homes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">' 
 

33 The third report was from a document dated 9 September 2003 in which it was stated (at [51]): 
 
 'Talks entered a new phase in mid-2003 with the LTTE putting forward new autonomy proposals in on-going discussions with the Sri Lankan government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">' 
 

34 The second Tribunal considered that the situation reflected in the country information considerably reduced any likelihood that Indian authorities would pursue the appellant in connection with his past pro-LTTE activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Sri Lankan government had embarked on a process of dialogue with the LTTE which had continued, although with continuing contention, for nearly two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Given these changed circumstances, the second Tribunal did not consider that Indian authorities were likely to show the same concerns about pro-LTTE activity in Indian as had been the case four years earlier when the neighbouring government in Sri Lanka was engaged in combating guerrilla warfare mounted by the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Moreover the appellant had been investigated and, in the second Tribunal's view, found not to have committed any offence requiring on-going action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Because of this the second Tribunal found that the appellant did not face a real chance of experiencing Convention-related persecution arising from his past association with the LTTE in India or his pro-Tamil political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">35 The second Tribunal also found the appellant's concerns about the possibility of action against him by the LTTE if he were returned were not well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">There was no reason, in view of the peace process, why the LTTE would wish to seek the assistance of the appellant or to 'punish' him for withdrawing that assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It suggested that the appellant might have an inflated idea of the assistance he provided to the LTTE as a 19 year old supporter of their cause and the extent to which they would now be concerned about his 1999 decision, following police action, to abandon that assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">36 The second Tribunal noted that the appellant's claims that his parents had sometimes been contacted by the LTTE asking about his whereabouts were unsupported by any material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It found that there was no real chance that the LTTE would either put pressure on him or provide assistance against his will or seek retribution from him for his past withdrawal of assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">If, contrary to that finding, there were some risk of action against the appellant by the LTTE, the second Tribunal found he would be able to obtain effective protection from the Indian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The action taken against the appellant himself over his LTTE associations suggested a readiness by the police to take action against illegal LTTE activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The appellant's contention that corrupt police paid by the LTTE might victimise him was not supported by evidence available to the Tribunal or by any material previously provided by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">37 The second Tribunal considered, given the appellant's stated views and his scepticism about the continuing peace process, that he remained sympathetic to the Tamil cause and that he might undertake pro-LTTE activity on his return to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However, in the circumstances applicable at the time of the decision and in the reasonably foreseeable future, there was no real chance of such conduct leading him to face Convention-related persecution by the Indian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">38 The second Tribunal concluded that the appellant's claims did not establish that he faced a real chance of serious harm or mistreatment on return because of his ethnicity, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Application for Judicial Review of the Second Tribunal Decision 
 
39 In an amended application for review filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 13 September 2004, the appellant set out the following grounds of review: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Firstly I would like to point out an inconsistency within the RRT's findings: in para 48 of the decision, it has stated that I didn't provide any material to support my claim that I was mistreated &amp; not properly clothed during my detention by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">But in para 49, it has concluded that my treatment did not amount to serious harm (or) mistreatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Like the above finding, the RRT has dismissed several of my claims purely on the basis that I was unable to provide additional material (08) detail (eg) findings in para 50 &amp; 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">There are 2 main reasons why I am unable to provide these materials (A) the police did not deal with me or detain me according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">In other words pro-LTTE activists were arrested &amp; mistreated without legally charging them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This makes impossible for persons like me to provide any legal evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">(B) If at all, I can provide any material now, I've to seek the assistance of my family in India who, since they live in Village doe not have enough exposure to help me with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' (sic)
 
 

40 After setting out the factual and procedural background and the decision of the second Tribunal, the learned Federal Magistrate identified the two grounds raised in the amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">As to the first of those grounds, namely inconsistency in the Tribunal's findings, the learned Federal Magistrate held no jurisdictional error was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He observed that in para 48 the second Tribunal accepted the appellant's testimony that his past activities had led to his being interrogated twice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It had recited the claims he made at the first hearing, the absence of detail or supporting material to support those claims and his evidence at the second hearing and explanation for what he had meant by 'torture'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In para 49 the second Tribunal had undertaken the task of assessing whether the appellant had suffered serious harm in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">41 The learned Federal Magistrate said (at [17]): 
 
 'The applicant takes issue with the Tribunal's factual findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The claim that the first Tribunal took a different approach to the evidence of the applicant is not such as to establish jurisdictional error on the part of the second Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It was a matter for the second Tribunal to weigh the evidence before it and to make findings on the basis of that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">' 
 

42 The second Tribunal's finding that the appellant had been interrogated by police on two occasions while detained was a reference back to its summary of his claims in the protection visa application relating to his mistreatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The second Tribunal accepted the elements of mistreatment claimed by the appellant in relation to his first detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Even if it found that such treatment did not amount to serious harm or persecution that was a conclusion of fact which did not establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The second Tribunal had regard not only to the absence of detail or additional material to support the elaboration of the claims about mistreatment during the first detention, it also had regard to the appellant's explanation that he had not been beaten during the second detention but suffered mental distress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In the circumstances there was no inconsistency in the second Tribunal's decision which could constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">43 The learned Magistrate held that the finding in relation to past mistreatment was not, in all the circumstances, critical to the Tribunal decision given its finding that circumstances had changed in India and that the appellant was no longer of interest to the Indian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">44 The learned Magistrate then turned to the second ground relied upon in the amended application namely that the second Tribunal had dismissed several of the claims on the basis of the absence of additional material or detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">This ground, however, was held not to establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">It was open to the second Tribunal not to accept the appellant's claim that Indian police were still arresting and questioning people who helped the LTTE in the past in the absence of material supporting that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It was not suggested that the appellant had in fact provided details in respect of his claim to be subject to new charges or any supporting documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It was open to the second Tribunal not to accept those claims without further detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In relation to the claim that the appellant feared harm from the LTTE, it was open to the second Tribunal to make the findings that it did on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In so doing it made no jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The appellant also challenged in written submissions the second Tribunal's finding that he could only leave India because he had been able to hide himself in a Hindu religious group was unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Again, this claim went to the merits of the decision and did not establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">45 The appellant took issue with the second Tribunal's reference to the peace process in Sri Lanka since late 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The appellant claimed there was news about recent developments in Sri Lanka that had put the peace process in jeopardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He referred to internet sources discussing events in Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The learned Federal Magistrate found there was no suggestion that this was material before the Tribunal or that it related to the situation in Sri Lanka as it stood at the time of the Tribunal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The information as to later developments in Sri Lanka would not assist the Court to determine whether or not the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The Amended Grounds of Appeal 
 
46 In a draft further amended notice of appeal the appellant advanced a number of particularised grounds which it is convenient to set out as follows: 
 
 '(1) The Tribunal made jurisdictional error as in finding that the applicant does not face a real chance of experiencing Convention-related persecution at the hands of the Indian authorities now or in the reasonable future, the Tribunal failed to ask two critical questions that it should have asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 Particulars 
 
 (a) Firstly it failed to ask "Since the Srilankan (sic) peace proposals have broken down now does the applicant have a well-founded fear on the basis that the civil war might start sometime in the future which might make him subject of persecution by both LTTE and Indian authorities" 
 
 (b) Secondly it also failed to ask "Though the Indian police had legitimate interest in pursuing the applicant, could the harm that the applicant was subject to because of his political opinion in support of LTTE, make the punishment he was subject to, a Convention-based harm" 
 
 (2) The Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it failed to consider the issue of whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to seek protection from police because of the past persecution/harm he encountered from police themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">
 
 Particulars 
 
 In assessing whether it is reasonable for the applicant to access state protection, the Tribunal must ask the question whether it is reasonable for the applicant to access that state protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In asking that question the Tribunal must look at the fact that the applicant was seriously harmed by the police and ask whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to seek the protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It failed to do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">
 
 (3) The Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that Tribunal made jurisdictional error in interpreting and applying what is meant by serious harm and held that what Applicant suffered was not persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 
 Particulars 
 
 In paragraph 18 of her decision (AB 151.80) Her Honour said that even if the conclusion that the treatment the applicant suffered was not serious harm or persecution could be called "startling one" it is a conclusion of fact and does not establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 
 The Tribunal said in para 48 at CB 96.20 that: 
 
 The Tribunal finds, on the basis of the applicant's testimony and the material he has put before the Tribunal as discussed above, that on two occasions in 1999 he was arrested, held in custody and interrogated but that, while it is plausible that he may have suffered unpleasant treatment, this treatment did not amount to serious harm or mistreatment as discussed in para 8 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 (4) The Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error in as it stated that in the absence of corroborative evidence it will not accept some of the applicants claims 
 
 Particulars 
 
 In Para 22 (AB 153.20) the learned Federal Magistrate said that: 
 
 The second ground relied on in the amended application is that the Tribunal dismissed several of the applicant's claims purely on the basis that he was unable to provide additional material or detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Reference is made to paragraphs 50 and 54 of the Tribunal reasons for decision which referred to the absence of supporting material in relation to police activities in India, in relation to the charges which the applicant claimed had been laid against him and in relation to incidents where the LTTE contacted people and sough (sic) the assistance of former helpers or as to any retribution against former helpers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Ground 5 
 
 (5)(a) Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error in making a critical finding without evidence 
 
 (5)(b) Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to make a critical finding without carefully considering the evidence it itself had which did not support the finding it made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 
 (5)(c) The Federal Magistrate also should have held that the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction in not considering the evidence it has at page CB 135.80 which said that " Tamil Tigers suspend their participation in peace talks, saying they are being marginalized " 
 
 Particulars for 5(a)-(c) 
 
 At 97.6 the Tribunal found that "The Srilankan (sic) government has embarked on a process of dialogue with the LTTE which has now continued (though with continuing contention) for nearly two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">' 
 
 

Grounds 3 and 4 of the draft amended notice of appeal reflected the terms of grounds 1 and 4 of the notice of appeal as originally filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The new grounds raised were grounds 1, 2 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The Merits of the Grounds of Appeal --- Actual and Proposed 
 
47 Three of the grounds of appeal set out in the proposed notice of appeal are new.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Much of the proposed grounds of appeal has little or any bearing on the grounds of review argued before the learned Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The appellant also seeks to put before the Court part of the transcript of the proceedings before the second Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">48 The threshold question in consideration of any proposed ground of appeal involving argument not advanced at first instance, is whether the ground has any merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In my opinion, the question of merit can be dealt with shortly in respect of each of the principal grounds and is dispositive of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">I shall consider each of the grounds set out in the proposed amended notice of appeal from that perspective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In my opinion none of the grounds has merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Each tries, in a different way, to attack the Tribunal's findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">None exposes jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Ground (1) 
 
49 The first ground relates to the second Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant did not face a real chance of Convention-related persecution at the hands of Indian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The jurisdictional error alleged is the failure to ask 'two critical questions' relevant to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">50 The first 'critical question' assumed the breakdown of the Sir Lankan peace negotiation at the time the second Tribunal made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The second Tribunal referred to country information in relation to the peace process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Counsel for the appellant said, in written submission, that the Tribunal had 'misconstrued the most recent country information'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He referred to an extract from the country information dated 9 September 2003, cited by the Tribunal, which said that 'Sri Lankan rebels moot proposals to revive peace talks' and 'Timeline Sri Lanka' in April 2003 said that: 
 
 'Tamil Tigers suspend their participation in peace talks saying they are being marginalized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">' 
 

The Tribunal referred to the peace process as 'contentious'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Its conclusions were of a factual character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">While there might be debate about how they were reached, no jurisdictional error is disclosed under this aspect of ground (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">51 The second question under ground (1) turned on the Tribunal's statement at [48] thus: 
 
 'The applicant acknowledged at that hearing that the reason for these arrests was that he was suspected of breaches of law applying to everyone in India; he agreed that it was not surprising the police took a continuing interest in him in view of his past association with the LTTE and that this interest was legitimate police work and not Convention-based persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">' 
 

52 Counsel for the appellant argued that in effect the Tribunal was addressing a false issue, namely whether the appellant's arrest and detention were Convention-related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It should have been asking whether the harm he had suffered at the hands of the police was Convention-related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">However, as was pointed out by counsel for the respondent, the Tribunal said (at [49]): 
 
 'The information available to the Tribunal suggests that the outcome of these investigations in 1999 was that the applicant was not convicted, further charged or subjected to any penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The applicant acknowledges that the effect of the investigations was to dissuade him from providing further assistance to the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The Tribunal finds, on the basis of the applicant's testimony and the material he has put before the Tribunal as discussed above, that on two occasions in 1999 he was arrested, held in custody and interrogated but that, while it is plausible that he may have suffered unpleasant treatment, this treatment did not amount to serious harm or mistreatment as discussed in para 8 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">' 
 

The reference to para 8 was a reference to the discussion earlier in the Tribunal's reasons of the requirement that the applicant for a protection visa must have a fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The concept of 'persecution' under the Convention is qualified by s 91R of the Act which requires that it must involve 'serious harm' to the applicant and systematic and discriminatory conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It is notable that the Tribunal did not make any finding of mistreatment beyond 'unpleasant treatment' at the hands of the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It referred to his claim that during his first detention he was beaten and not properly fed or clothed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">However in his second detention he was not beaten but suffered mental distress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The continuous 'torture' referred to in his documentary testimony was a reference to the emotional impact upon him of alleged police approaches to his family asking about his whereabouts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">53 Again, in my opinion, having regard to its findings of fact, the Tribunal has not failed to address the criteria which it was required to address for the purpose of determining the appellant's eligibility for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The conclusions it reached may be contestable as matters of fact, but not in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">54 Moreover, as counsel for the respondent points out in written submissions, that the learned Federal Magistrate observed that the Tribunal's decision did not depend upon its characterisation of the appellant's past mistreatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The learned Federal Magistrate said (at [19]): 
 
 'Moreover, the finding in relation to past mistreatment is not in all the circumstances critical to the Tribunal decision given its finding that circumstances had changed in India and that, on the basis of these changed circumstances and the limited involvement of the applicant in the past, he was no longer of interest to the Indian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Hence whether the applicant had suffered serious harm in the past was not determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">' 
 

As counsel for the respondent pointed out, the Tribunal's lack of satisfaction that there was a protection obligation towards the appellant depended upon its assessment of what the appellant had a real chance of facing in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Ground (2) 
 
55 Ground (2) raises the question whether the Tribunal failed to consider the reasonableness of the appellant invoking State protection having regard to the persecution he had previously encountered from police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">At [56] of its decision the Tribunal said: 
 
 'The Tribunal considers that if, contrary to its finding above, there is some risk of action against the applicant by the LTTE, he would be able to obtain effective protection from the Indian authorities...' 
 

Counsel for the appellant argued that the Tribunal must ask the question whether it is reasonable for the particular appellant to access that State protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">It failed to have regard to the antecedent history of treatment of the appellant by police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Counsel referred to part of the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In that part of the hearing the appellant expressed his lack of trust or belief in the police because many of them, he thought, helped the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">56 Counsel for the respondent contended that the question which was posed by the appellant was not a question which the Tribunal was jurisdictionally obliged to ask.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It was required to consider whether the appellant's fear was objectively well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">As was pointed out on behalf of the respondent, the Tribunal clearly found that the appellant was no longer of interest to the police as a result of his past activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In my opinion, there is no jurisdictional error disclosed under ground (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Ground (3) 
 
57 Ground (3) asserted a misinterpretation on the part of the Tribunal of serious harm in its holding that what the appellant suffered was not persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">This was a matter which had been raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">58 The learned Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal accepted the elements of mistreatment claimed by the appellant in relation to the first detention as alleged in the statutory declaration accompanying his protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">However, even if the Tribunal found that such treatment did not amount to 'serious harm' or 'persecution' within the meaning of the Convention, such a finding, as Wilcox J said of the first Tribunal's finding, while startling, would be a conclusion of fact and not reflective of jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">And as the learned Magistrate added (at [18]): 
 
 'Further the Tribunal in this instance had regard not only to the absence of detail or additional material to support the subsequent elaboration of his claims about mistreatment during his first detention, but also to his explanation that he had not been beaten during his second detention but suffered mental distress in its finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It also noted the absence of further clarification at the second hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">In these circumstances there is no inconsistency in its decision such as to constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">' 
 

59 Importantly, even if the past mistreatment in the first detention in 1999 had constituted persecution for a Convention reason, it had no real bearing upon the outcome of the Tribunal's decision which depended, in part, upon changed circumstances in India at the time of its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Ground (4) 
 
60 In support of ground (4) the appellant referred to para 22 of the judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate which has already been set out in the recitation of the proposed grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">61 The reference to the Tribunal's reasoning about corroborative material appears to be a reference to paras 50 and 54 of the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The Tribunal noted in para 50 that although the appellant had claimed in his protection visa application that Indian police had framed new charges against him and involved him in old and new cases, he gave no details such as the dates or the nature of the charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">At para 54 the Tribunal referred to the appellant's claims that his parents had been contacted by the LTTE from time to time asking about his whereabouts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The Tribunal noted that these claims were 'unsupported by any material put forward by the applicant and finds that there is no real chance that the LTTE would either put pressure on him to provide assistance against his will or seek retribution from him for his past withdrawal of his assistance'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">62 These paragraphs in the Tribunal's reasons do not involve any impermissible requirement that claims made by an applicant will not be accepted unless corroborated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">What they indicate is that in the circumstances of this particular case, absent any independent material, the Tribunal was not prepared to rely upon the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">There is no jurisdictional error in that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Ground (5) 
 
63 As to ground (5) this does not appear from the particulars or the submissions to raise any new issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Conclusion 
 
64 The appellant was unrepresented before the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">He had had representation on appeal in this Court and the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal were fully argued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">I have dealt with the merits of those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">In my opinion the proposed amendments to the notice of appeal should be allowed and the appeal dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">65 For the preceding reasons, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
