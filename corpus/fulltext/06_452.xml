 The nature of the proceeding 
 

 
1 This case is concerned with the validity of the nomination of Valerie Ann Butler for two offices in elections conducted within an organisation registered pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In order for her nominations to be valid, pursuant to the rules of the organisation, Ms Butler had to be a financial member attached to a particular divisional branch of the organisation, and had to have had that status for at least 12 months, at the date of closing of nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The question whether Ms Butler was a member attached to the relevant divisional branch is unusually complicated, because of difficulties of construction of the relevant rules, the failure of the rules to make provision for some matters, and failure to observe the rules in some respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union ('the Union') is an organisation, registered pursuant to the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The provisions of the WR Act governing the registration and conduct of the affairs of registered organisations are now found in Sch 1B of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Notwithstanding that those provisions are found in a schedule, they are designated as sections and subsections, as if they were provisions found in the body of the WR Act itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Accordingly, a reference in these reasons for judgment to a section, accompanied by a number, is to be taken to be a reference to a provision in Sch 1B of the WR Act, unless the contrary is indicated, in order to avoid the necessity to make constant reference to the fact that the provisions are found in Sch 1B. 
 

 
3 By written decision dated 21 March 2005, pursuant to s 189(3), a deputy industrial registrar recorded the fact that the Union had lodged in the Industrial Registry prescribed information in relation to the conduct of an election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Attached to the decision was a list of the offices within the Union for which prescribed information in relation to the conduct of elections had been lodged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Among the offices listed were three branch committee of management members from the Lines and General Divisional Section of the Victorian Postal and Telecommunications Branch ('the P&amp;T Branch'), and one divisional executive member from the Lines and General Divisional Section of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The deputy industrial registrar's decision pronounced that he was satisfied that an election for all the offices listed in the attachment was required to be held under the rules of the Union, and announced that he was making arrangements for the conduct of the election by the Australian Electoral Commission, in accordance with s 189(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The elections were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In Victoria, the returning officer was John Pepper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">After the returning officer had called for nominations, he received two nomination forms in respect of Valerie Ann Butler, each signed by two financial members of the Union attached to the Lines and General Divisional Section of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In one form, Ms Butler was nominated for the office of branch committee of management member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In the other, she was nominated for the office of divisional executive member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The returning officer received both forms on 2 May 2005, the closing date for nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 The applicant in the present proceeding, Ms Gail Cholosznecki, objected to the nominations of Ms Butler.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The returning officer made inquiries of Ms Butler, and of the branch secretaries of the P&amp;T Branch and Victorian Telecommunications and Services Branch ('the T&amp;S Branch').</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">After considering responses to those inquiries, the returning officer decided to accept the nominations of Ms Butler.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Ballots were conducted in relation to a number of offices, from 1 June 2005 to 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 5 July 2005, the returning officer declared the results of the ballots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He declared Ms Butler elected to both of the offices for which she had been nominated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In the ballot for three branch committee of management members, Ms Butler's vote tally was the third highest of five candidates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In the ballot for divisional executive member, Ms Butler defeated Ms Cholosznecki, the only other candidate, by 49 votes, 183 to 134.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Those who were successful in the elections took office on 1 August 2005, and are due to hold office until 31 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">6 On 30 September 2005, Ms Cholosznecki applied to the Court, pursuant to s 200(1), for an inquiry into the elections for the offices to which Ms Butler was elected, alleging that there had been an irregularity in relation to each election, because Ms Butler was not eligible to be nominated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There is no dispute that Ms Cholosznecki is a member of the union, and therefore has standing to apply pursuant to s 200(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">On 18 October 2005, in accordance with s 201, being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for the application, I fixed a time and place for the conduct of the inquiry, initially for directions only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I directed service of the application on a number of parties, including the two unsuccessful candidates for the office of branch committee of management member, the Union, the Communications Division of the Union, the P&amp;T Branch, and the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">At the first directions hearing, on 24 October 2005, there were appearances on behalf of Ms Cholosznecki, Ms Butler, the Australian Electoral Commission and the returning officer, and the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">An affidavit of service has now been filed, establishing that service on the other parties was effected in accordance with my order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">At the hearing of the inquiry, those representing the Australian Electoral Commission and the returning officer, and the Union, sought and were granted leave to withdraw from the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Leave to withdraw was granted to the representative of the Union, despite my misgivings about being deprived of any assistance the Union might have been able to give me with respect to the construction of its rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The issues were therefore argued between counsel for Ms Cholosznecki and counsel for Ms Butler.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Union's rules 
 

 
7 Rule 4 of the Union's national rules contains definitions of a number of terms, which are applicable 'unless the contrary intention appears'.</sentence>

<sentence id="s58">By r 6.1.1 of its national rules, the Union is to have divisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Rule 6.1.2 refers to three divisions, each apparently corresponding with a former registered organisation, which became part of the Union.</sentence>

<sentence id="s61">' Rule 6.1.3 provides that each member shall be attached to a division or divisional group as the case may be.</sentence>

<sentence id="s63">10 Rule 23.1 of the Union's national rules requires that each division or divisional group shall, in accordance with the rules of the division, keep a membership register.</sentence>

12 It should be noted that the provisions of r 32(d) appear to have been designed to reflect the provisions, now found in s 174, in which Parliament has specified the content of the rules of registered organisations as to resignation of membership, for which the rules of an organisation are required by s 141(1)(b)(viii) to provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">13 Rule 44 of the rules of the Communications Division provides relevantly as follows:

 Ms Butler's membership history 
 

 
19 From 16 December 1994 until 2 September 2005, Ms Butler was an employee of Telstra Corporation Ltd at its call centre at Burwood in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In July 1999, she submitted an application for membership of the Union to the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">She was accepted as a member and attached to the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Within the T&amp;S Branch, she was allocated to the Technical Divisional Section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Thereafter, until March 2005, Ms Butler paid her dues to the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">On 8 July 2003, she was elected as a branch committee of management member of the T&amp;S Branch, and she continued to attend meetings of the branch committee of management of the T&amp;S Branch until March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">20 Ms Butler submitted a further application for membership, dated 18 July 2003, to the P&amp;T Branch on or about that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In response, she received a letter dated 31 July 2003 from the then Victorian Branch Secretary of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The letter, so far as relevant, informed her as follows:
 

 
 'Your membership application has been received in this office, and in accordance with the registered rules, you were accepted as a member from that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">May I extend to you a very warm welcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 
 So that you derive the benefits and privileges of membership, it is most important that you remain financial at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 
 Financial membership entitles you to: 
 
 ... 
 
 I wish you a long and happy association with this union, and assure you of our co-operation at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 
 

21 The branch committee of management of the P&amp;T Branch met on 12 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The agenda for that meeting contained the following item:
 

 
 ' NEW MEMBERS: 
 
 
 POSTAL 33 
 DAVIDS 10 
 POST LOGISTICS 1 
 TELSTRA 1 
 
 TOTAL 45' 
 
 
 

22 Counsel for Ms Butler informed me that Ms Butler was the single Telstra employee to which the agenda item referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The minutes of the branch committee of management meeting record the passage of a resolution in the following terms:
 

 
 'That the Secretary be authorised to admit 45 new members without them being required to pay a joining fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">' 
 
 

23 According to an affidavit of Ms Butler, filed during the hearing of the proceeding, the letter of 31 July 2003 was accompanied by a membership card.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The card was not in evidence, but was said to have been in terms that indicated that Ms Butler was a member of the Union attached to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Within the records of the P&amp;T Branch, she was shown as having been allocated to the Lines and General Divisional Section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Ms Butler then continued to pay dues to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Her name appeared in its register of members and she was treated by the P&amp;T Branch as being a member of the Union attached to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Shortly after the events described in [20]-[22], Ms Butler was appointed a part-time industrial officer of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It is unclear whether anyone in the administration of the P&amp;T Branch was aware that Ms Butler's name continued to appear on the register of members of the T&amp;S Branch, or that she continued to pay dues to the T&amp;S Branch, in addition to those she paid to the P&amp;T Branch, and to attend meetings of the branch committee of management of the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Ms Butler herself was unaware of r 5.1.3 of the national rules of the Union until March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">24 By letter dated 20 March 2005, addressed to the Branch Secretary of the T&amp;S Branch, Ms Butler informed the Branch Secretary in the following terms:
 

 
 'I wish to resign my membership of the CEPU (Victorian T&amp;S Branch) effective immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 
 Please cease direct debit payments from my bank account at the earliest possible convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 Thankyou for your prompt attention to this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">' 
 
 
 The issues to be determined 
 

 
25 Ms Cholosznecki's case was based on the assumption that, because Ms Butler was attached to the T&amp;S Branch from the time she became a member of the Union, she could not become attached to the P&amp;T Branch otherwise than in accordance with the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Rule 5.1.3 of the national rules expressly prohibited her from being attached to more than one divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The only provision in the rules under which Ms Butler could have become attached to the P&amp;T Branch was the provision in r 5.1.5, allowing her to be transferred to another divisional branch, and this had not occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Accordingly, Ms Cholosznecki contended that Ms Butler had not been attached to the P&amp;T Branch for the requisite period of 12 months prior to the close of nominations, and was consequently ineligible to be nominated for the positions to which she was purportedly elected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">26 Counsel for Ms Butler drew attention to the authorities which established the existence of the principle known as the doctrine of incompatible offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Ultimately, the argument on behalf of Ms Butler was based on the principle of surrender by implication, which is said to underlie the doctrine of incompatible offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">On this view, if Ms Butler became attached to the P&amp;T Branch, she impliedly surrendered her attachment to the T&amp;S Branch, because r 5.1.3 expressly made it clear that she could not retain both, and the accession to the second nullified the first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">This leaves open the question whether Ms Butler did validly become attached to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It may be that the doctrine of implied surrender applies even where there is an invalid attempt to take up a new position that is incompatible with a position already held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">If that principle were to be applied to the facts of the present case, the result would be that Ms Butler would be attached to neither the P&amp;T Branch nor the T&amp;S Branch, unless she became attached validly to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Accordingly, it was necessary for counsel for Ms Butler to contend that she had been transferred to the P&amp;T Branch, in accordance with r 5.1.5, or that even in the absence of such a transfer, by her own actions she had become attached to the P&amp;T Branch, without the necessity for a formal transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">27 Both of the relevant parties accepted, and it seems to be clear beyond argument, that the effect of r 5.1.3 was to prevent Ms Butler from being attached to more than one divisional branch at the same time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It was also accepted that her attachment to the T&amp;S Branch, from the time she joined the Union in 1999, was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It therefore became necessary to determine whether Ms Butler was transferred from the T&amp;S Branch to the P&amp;T Branch, in accordance with r 5.1.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">One difficulty relating to this issue is the absence of any rules of the 'appropriate division', ie the Communications Division, providing for transfer from one divisional branch to another, and the absence of evidence as to any recognised process for such transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">There is a question whether Ms Butler's unilateral actions, or the actions of the P&amp;T Branch in accepting her application of 18 July 2003, could result in her being transferred for the purposes of r 5.1.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">There is then a question whether, in any event, r 5.1.5 is to be read as a provision exhaustive of the circumstances in which a member may cease to be attached to one divisional branch and become attached to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In particular, there is a question whether this can be effected by unilateral action of the member, or by acceptance of such action by the recipient divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If such a process of unattachment and reattachment be possible, there is a question whether it occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">28 Underlying a number of these issues are questions as to the nature and content of the principle of implied surrender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It is to those questions that I turn first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The principle of surrender by implication 
 

 
29 The principle known as the doctrine of incompatible offices was recognised by the Full Court in Egan v Maher (No 2) (1978) 35 FLR 252 as applicable in circumstances in which a person attempted to hold two elected offices in a registered organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">All three judges of the Full Court, Smithers J at 256, Evatt J at 260 (agreeing with Northrop J) and Northrop J at 262-263 accepted the existence of the doctrine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The majority (Evatt and Northrop JJ) held that the doctrine even applied to a situation in which the holder of one office attempted to assume a second, incompatible, office, but the attempt was unsuccessful because the second office was not vacant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Smithers J disagreed on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Northrop J, in the passage to which I have referred, relied on the Iron Ship Coating Co Ltd v Blunt (1868) 3 LR CP 484 as authority for the existence of the doctrine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The doctrine has since been applied in Mellor v Horn (1988) 25 IR 157 at 159-161, and in Johnson v Beitseen (1988) 41 IR 395 at 412-413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It has been mentioned in Sherrif v Townsend (1980) 48 FLR 20 at 54 by Northrop J (dissenting on the relevant issue), and in Price v Hodgson (1992) 41 IR 178 at 179.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">30 In the Iron Ship case at 488, Willes J, one of the three judges constituting the Court of Common Pleas, quoted from earlier authority in the following terms:
 

 
 '"the grant of an office to one who has another office incompatible, is not good; for, the first office will thereby be void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">As, if a forester, by patent for life be made justice in eyre of the same forest pro h&acirc;c vice, the office of forester will be void; for, it is incompatible, being subject to correction by the justices in eyre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">" Several other illustrations are there put: amongst them, that "the chief justice of C.B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">cannot be prothonotary or clerk of the papers in the same Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">" This is founded upon a principle which runs through the whole of the law, and is applicable to surrenders by implication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 

31 I take this statement to mean that the doctrine of incompatible offices is simply an illustration of a wider principle, whereby the occupant of any position, whether an 'office' or not, who assumes a second position, incompatible with the first, relinquishes the first position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">There appears to be no reason why this broader principle should not apply to membership of a registered organisation or, as in the present case, to attachment of a member to a division or divisional branch within a registered organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">That being so, the central assumption of Ms Cholosznecki's case, that Ms Butler could not become attached to the P&amp;T Branch, because of her continued membership of the T&amp;S Branch, is demonstrated to be false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Rather, if Ms Butler became attached to the P&amp;T Branch, in the absence of anything in the rules of the Union to the contrary, her membership of the T&amp;S Branch ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">32 It is apparent from the authorities that the relinquishment of the first position does not depend upon the existence of a subjective intention to relinquish it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The only intention required is the intention to assume the second position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Although the doctrine of incompatible offices has sometimes been put in terms of implied resignation from the first office, it is clear that the first office is lost by operation of law, not by any determination on the part of the person concerned to lose it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In Egan , the national assistant secretary of a registered organisation allowed himself to be appointed as the national secretary, when there was thought to be a vacancy in the latter office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The appointee deliberately refrained from resigning as national assistant secretary, because he was aware that the resolution declaring the office of national secretary vacant might not be valid, as turned out to be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">He was consciously attempting to hold both offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Because the Court found the offices to be incompatible, in the sense that the same person could not hold the two at once, he was held to have abandoned the office of national assistant secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">At 262-263, Northrop J emphasised the proposition that the doctrine applies by operation of law, by comparing it to the doctrine of election between inconsistent rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">33 The proposition that the implication in the principle of surrender by implication arises from the operation of law, rather than as a matter of fact from the nature of the conduct, or as a matter of presumed intention, of the person concerned, is important in the understanding of the relationship between the principle and any express provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Of course, any implication must be subject to what is provided expressly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Determining whether the principle of surrender by implication is ousted by express provision in a particular case involves examining the relevant express provisions from the standpoint of whether they are inconsistent with the implication by law, rather than whether they are inconsistent with an implied intention on the part of the person concerned to produce a particular outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Thus, in Johnson , the presence of an express rule of the registered organisation, in accordance with which the person concerned could have resigned the first office, was held to be insufficient to oust the application of the doctrine of incompatible offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This was so, notwithstanding authority that a purported resignation that did not accord with the express rule concerning resignation would have been ineffective to bring about a resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">At 412-413, I said:
 

 
 'The doctrine of incompatible offices applies to a registered organisation by way of implication arising from the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It is an implication which arises by operation of law, where incompatible offices exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Like all implications, it may be excluded by the express terms of the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It is not, however, to be regarded as an implied term, arising from the presumed intention of all parties to the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">A party asserting that the branch rules contain an implication that more than one office cannot be held validly may find that such an implication is only to be found together with an implication that the assumption of a second office vacates the first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In accordance with the doctrine of incompatible offices, this must be so, unless it is excluded by clear words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The words of r 29 do not refer to the doctrine of incompatible offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">They contemplate an express attempt to resign, rather than one which arises by operation of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">They may operate to prevent a resignation from taking effect where the person resigning simply states an intention to refuse to continue to hold the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">That was the position in Hassett v Harding .</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Rule 29 does not have the appearance of a complete code, governing all types of resignation, including those arising by operation of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">' 
 
 

34 The authorities relating to the doctrine of incompatible offices also make it clear that the incompatibility need not arise from an express provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It is sufficient if, by their nature, the two positions are incompatible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The illustrations cited by Willes J, in the passage I have quoted in [30] make this plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">So do the facts of the Iron Ship case itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In that case, there was an express provision in the articles of association of the company that a director could not be appointed to any other office in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The person concerned held the office of secretary of the company, which he was held to have vacated by accepting appointment as a director, although the articles of association made no express provision about this order of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The express provision illustrated the incompatible nature of the two offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In Egan , Mellor and Johnson , there were no express provisions that could be called in aid in determining whether the relevant offices were incompatible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In each case, the two offices involved membership of deliberative bodies, the members of which were elected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">It was the implication, gathered from the relevant rules, that it was not intended that one person should have more than one vote on such a deliberative body, which led to the conclusion that there was incompatibility involved in one person holding more than one of the offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">35 With this understanding of the principle of surrender by implication in mind, it is necessary to turn to the specific issues in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Was Ms Butler transferred?</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 

 
36 The construction of the phrase 'be transferred' in r 5.1.5 of the Union's national rules is not easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The task of determining whether Ms Butler was transferred from the T&amp;S Branch to the P&amp;T Branch is not made any easier by the absence of any other provision in the national rules of the Union, or the Communications Division rules, for the process by which the transfer is to be effected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">37 Dictionary definitions are not particularly helpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Macquarie Dictionary defines 'transfer', when used as a transitive verb, as 'to convey or remove from one place, person, etc., to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">' As an intransitive verb, the Macquarie Dictionary defines 'transfer' to mean 'to transfer oneself', or 'to be transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">'
 

 
38 The process of transfer of a member pursuant to r 5.1.5 has three components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The first is the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch from which the member is being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The second is the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch to which the member is being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The third is the member himself or herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">As a matter of logic, it might be said that the process of being transferred could involve action by the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch from which the member is being transferred, action by the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch to which the member is being transferred, action by the member who is being transferred, or some combination of those three elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">In the present case, the question is whether Ms Butler was transferred from the T&amp;S Branch to the P&amp;T Branch by a combination of action on her part and action on the part of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">It seems clear that the T&amp;S Branch played no part at all in the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It is therefore necessary to construe the phrase 'be transferred' in r 5.1.5, in order to determine whether what Ms Butler did, and what the P&amp;T Branch did, resulted in Ms Butler being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">In order to construe the phrase 'be transferred', it is necessary to see what clues as to its meaning might lie within the Union's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">39 The first clue is the fact that the verb is expressed in the passive voice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The rule does not say that a member may transfer from one division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The use of the passive voice suggests that being transferred is something that someone other than the member concerned does to the member concerned, not something that the member concerned does himself or herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The question, therefore, appears to be whether a member is to be transferred by action by the transferor division, divisional branch or sub-branch, action by the recipient division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch, or combined action by both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">40 It is important to note that r 5.1.5 applies to transfers between divisions, as well as between divisional branches and divisional sub-branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">There is nothing in the rule to indicate that the phrase 'be transferred' should bear a different meaning, according to whether the transfer is between divisions, divisional branches or divisional sub-branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">This point has some importance, because there are some indications in the national rules of the Union that provide clues as to how the phrase 'be transferred' should be construed when the transfer concerned is one between divisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">41 The first such indication is found in r 5.1.5 itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">A transfer is to be 'in accordance with the rules of the appropriate division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">' According to the definition in r 4.1, the appropriate division is the division to which a member has been attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">This suggests that, whatever might be the content of the process of transfer, it is a process to be initiated by the division from which the member is being transferred, and not by the recipient division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The absence of any rules of the Communications Division governing any process of transfer of members does not nullify the point that r 5.1.5 contemplates that a transfer between divisions is to be conducted according to a process prescribed by rules of the transferor division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In turn, this suggests that a transfer between divisional branches or divisional sub-branches is to be a process initiated in and controlled by the transferor divisional branch, or divisional sub-branch, as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">42 Support for this view is to be found in r 23 of the national rules of the Union, which imposes on each division or divisional group the obligation to keep a membership register, and in r 50 of the rules of the Communications Division, which devolves the obligation to keep the register of members onto the secretary of each divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">As a practical matter, for a member to be transferred from one divisional branch to another would require that his or her name be removed from the register of members of the transferor divisional branch and placed on that of the recipient divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This process could not occur without at least the involvement of the secretary of the transferor divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Similarly, r 32(a) of the rules of the Communications Division provides for payment of contributions to the branch secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">A transfer to another divisional branch would involve a transfer of this obligation, so that it became an obligation to pay contributions to the branch secretary of the recipient divisional branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">If the rules provided for a single national register of members, and for payment of contributions to a national official, it might be easier to imagine that a transfer process could operate without the involvement of the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch from which the member was being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">43 Counsel for Ms Cholosznecki contended that Ms Butler could not have been transferred from the T&amp;S Branch to the P&amp;T Branch unless she had resigned from the T&amp;S Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The difficulty with this argument is that r 5.1.4 of the national rules of the Union provides that, upon resignation from a division, the member shall be deemed to have resigned from the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It is apparent from this rule that a member could not be transferred from one division to another by a process involving resigning from the transferor division, because the act of resignation would bring about the member's resignation from membership of the Union altogether.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">If resignation cannot be part of a transfer from one division to another, it is difficult to see how it could be part of the process of being transferred from one divisional branch to another, because the one rule, r 5.1.5, provides for each kind of transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">44 I have considered whether some guidance is available from r 5.5 of the national rules of the Union, under which clearances are to be granted in accordance with the rules of the appropriate division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">As I understand the expression, a clearance is normally something granted by one trade union, if a member wishing to resign and join another trade union has paid all dues owing in respect of the trade union from which the member is resigning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Armed with the clearance, the member may then present his or her application for membership of a new trade union and be treated as having good standing with the trade union from which he or she has recently resigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">This understanding appears to be consistent with the provisions of r 32(b) of the rules of the Communications Division, under which an applicant for membership of the Union through the Communications Division is excused from any obligation to pay an entrance fee if he or she has a clearance from a bona fide industrial organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">There is no evidence in the present case as to whether clearances are granted for a transfer between divisions, or between divisional branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">In the absence of such evidence, it is difficult to call in aid r 5.5 in the construction of r 5.1.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">45 Slight though the indications found in the rules are, they tend to suggest that the process of being transferred, contemplated by r 5.1.5, is intended to be a process in which the division, divisional branch or divisional sub-branch from which the member is being transferred is, at the very least, to be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">In the present case, it appears clear that the T&amp;S Branch was not involved in any process of transferring Ms Butler to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">What was done appears to have been done entirely by Ms Butler herself, by submitting her fresh application for membership of the Union to the P&amp;T Branch, and by the P&amp;T Branch, in accepting and processing that application for membership and allocating Ms Butler to the Lines and General Divisional Section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The fact that Ms Butler continued to carry out the functions attached to the office of member of the committee of management of the T&amp;S Branch, to which she had previously been elected, and continued to pay dues to the Branch Secretary of the T&amp;S Branch, suggests that the T&amp;S Branch was not at all involved in any process of transferring her to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">It is unlikely that those administering the T&amp;S Branch would have chosen to act contrary to the rules of the Union by continuing to treat Ms Butler as a member of the T&amp;S Branch, if they had been aware that she had become a member of the P&amp;T Branch, and if they had been aware of the provisions of r 5.1.3 of the national rules of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">It is therefore necessary to conclude that Ms Butler was not transferred from the T&amp;S Branch to the P&amp;T Branch in accordance with r 5.1.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">No action taken by Ms Butler, the P&amp;T Branch, or both in conjunction, could be effective to transfer her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Attachment otherwise than by being transferred 
 

 
46 The question remains whether what was done by Ms Butler, and by the P&amp;T Branch, was nonetheless effective to attach Ms Butler to the P&amp;T Branch more than 12 months before the closing date for nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The document Ms Butler submitted to the P&amp;T Branch in July 2003 was an application to become a member of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Such an application would ordinarily be submitted by a person who is not already a member of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Further, the application was dealt with by the P&amp;T Branch as if it were an application by a person not already a member of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">If the P&amp;T Branch had dealt with the application as if it were an application by an existing member of the Union to become attached to the P&amp;T Branch, it might have been necessary to consider whether a member could become attached to a divisional branch, and thereby impliedly surrender any attachment to a previous divisional branch, by indicating an intention to change attachments, which was accepted by the divisional branch to which the intention was signified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">As a matter of fact, this was not what occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Plainly, no-one involved in the administration of the P&amp;T Branch was aware that Ms Butler was already a member of the Union, attached to the T&amp;S Branch, when her new application was processed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">She was treated as an entirely new member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">47 Nothing in the rules of the Union appears expressly to prevent one person holding two memberships of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Dual, or multiple, memberships are contrary to the structure of the Union's rules, however.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">If they were to be regarded as being permitted by the rules, dual or multiple memberships would enable a single person, with sufficient resources to pay all necessary dues, to exercise more than one vote in elections within the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Such a situation would tend against the achievement of the object found in s 5(d) , in accordance with which the provisions of Sch 1B of the WR Act are intended to 'provide for the democratic functioning and control of organisations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">' In accordance with this object, s 141(1)(b)(iv) requires that the rules of an organisation provide for the control of committees of the organisation and its branches respectively by the members of the organisation and branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">If the rules of an organisation permitted multiple membership, and therefore multiple voting, they would very likely be held to impose on members conditions, obligations or restrictions that, having regard to the objects of Sch 1B and the WR Act, and the purposes of the registration of organisations, were oppressive, unreasonable or unjust, in contravention of s 142(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The provisions of s 143(1)(a), in conjunction with the definitions of 'direct voting system' and 'collegiate electoral system' in s 6, would be violated by rules of an organisation that permitted one person to hold more than one membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In theory, a person with sufficient resources, could hold sufficient memberships to acquire effective control of an organisation or a branch of an organisation by dominating the elections of its officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">It follows that, while not expressly prohibiting dual membership, the rules of the Union must be read and construed on the basis that each member of the Union will be a separate person and each person can only hold one membership of the Union at one time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">48 Once this is accepted, it follows that the conferment of a second membership on a person is incompatible with the continued holding of that person's previous membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">By operation of law, in accordance with the principle of implied surrender, the person must be taken to have relinquished the previous membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">In accordance with that doctrine, it cannot be said that the holding of the first membership renders it impossible for the person to acquire a second membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Rather, the correct analysis is that the acquisition of the second membership involves implied surrender, by operation of law, of the first membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">49 The principle of implied surrender can only apply to the extent to which it is not excluded by express provisions of the Union's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In this respect, the provisions of r 32(d) of the rules of the Communications Division are highly relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">As I have said, those provisions reflect the requirement of s 141(1)(b)(viii), that the rules of an organisation must provide for the resignation of members under s 174, and s 174 itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Although r 32(d) is expressed in permissive terms, it may be taken to be a code as to the manner in which a person intending to effect a resignation from membership of the Union may do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">In accordance with authorities like Hassett v Harding (1976) 27 FLR 457 at 460-461, it would probably be held that an attempt to resign otherwise than in accordance with r 32(d) would be ineffective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The fact that r 32(d) is a rule, and is in a form, required by the WR Act reinforces this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">50 The principle of implied surrender effects a surrender by operation of law, as I have said in [32].</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It does not operate to effect a surrender as a result of the implication of an intention on the part of the person concerned to surrender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">There is therefore a question whether the principle of implied surrender is inconsistent with an express rule applying only to the manifestation of an actual intention to resign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">51 On this point, I take the same view as I took in Johnson at 412-413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Despite the existence of r 32(d) of the Communications Division rules, it is my view that an attempt to acquire a second membership automatically vacates the first membership of the person making the attempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">52 It follows that, by making her application by means of her form dated 18 July 2003 to the P&amp;T Branch, and by the manner in which the P&amp;T Branch dealt with that application, Ms Butler again became a member of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Her accession to this membership had the effect of bringing about the cessation of her previous membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">At the same time, it had the effect of causing her to cease to be a member attached to the T&amp;S Branch and to become a member attached to the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">No issue of an entrance fee arose because the committee of management exercised its power, derived from r 32(c) of the Communications Division rules, to waive such a fee, in respect of all those it admitted to membership at its meeting on 12 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The conclusion that Ms Butler became a member of the Union, attached to the P&amp;T Branch, would follow even if there had been no provision such as r 5.1.3 of the national rules of the Union, because of the inherent impossibility of holding two memberships of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">53 To the extent to which Ms Cholosznecki attempted to rely on r 46(c) of the rules of the Communications Division, her case must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It is not clear at precisely what point in time Ms Butler was allocated to the Lines and General Divisional Section in the P&amp;T Branch, but it is safe to presume that the rules were complied with (the presumption of regularity) in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and therefore that the allocation was made prior to Ms Butler's appointment as an industrial officer of the P&amp;T Branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Rule 46(c) operated to cause that allocation to continue after Ms Butler was appointed an industrial officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Her earlier allocation to the Technical Divisional Section in the T&amp;S Branch did not survive her implied surrender of her earlier membership of the Union, and could not be revived by operation of r 46(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Conclusion 
 

 
54 For the foregoing reasons, Ms Butler became a member of the Union, attached to the P&amp;T Branch in July or August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">This was more than 12 months prior to the closing of nominations in the elections for the offices for which she was a candidate, and to which she was elected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">She complied with the requirement of r 66(a) of the Communications Division rules that she be a 'continuously financial member' of the P&amp;T Branch for a period of not less than 12 months immediately prior to the closing date of nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Accordingly, there was no irregularity in the returning officer accepting her nominations for both of those offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">55 It follows that the application for an inquiry into the elections must be dismissed; an order pursuant to s 206(4) can only be made if the Court finds that an irregularity has happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">56 At the conclusion of the hearing of the inquiry, I raised the question whether Ms Cholosznecki would be entitled to a certificate pursuant to s 325(1), if her application were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Counsel for Ms Cholosznecki was not at that stage in possession of instructions to seek such a certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">There seems little doubt that such a certificate ought to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The issues raised by the application for an inquiry are complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The returning officer found them to be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">They have caused me to have to reserve my judgment, in order to reach a conclusion about them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">I am therefore prepared to certify that Ms Cholosznecki acted reasonably in applying for an inquiry into the elections the subject of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">If it should turn out that Ms Cholosznecki does not wish to avail herself of the certificate, she need not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">57 Otherwise, s 329(1) applies to the proceeding, and no order for costs can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">I certify that the preceding fifty-seven (57) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray.</sentence>
