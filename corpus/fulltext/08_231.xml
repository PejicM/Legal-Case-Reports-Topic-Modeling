 BUCHANAN J: 
 
 1 On 22 February 2008 I made an order dismissing an application for an extension of time in which to appeal, and other, consequential orders, including an order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I did not, at that time, give reasons for the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">What follows are my reasons for making the orders on 22 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The applicant wished to bring an appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMCA') ( SZHXH v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2007] FMCA 915) which was delivered on 5 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She took no step to do so until 24 September 2007 when she filed an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a Notice of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The procedural difficulties which face the applicant before any appeal can be heard are greater than she appears to appreciate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The decision of the FMCA was a decision under Rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules to dismiss an application as one not disclosing an arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Rule 44.12(2) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules indicates that such a judgment is an interlocutory one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Authority in this Court supports that conclusion (see Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 38 at [17] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Apart from an extension of time leave is required to file the appeal which the applicant wishes to pursue ( Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 24(1A)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">No application for such leave has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Although, in a draft Notice of Appeal attached to her affidavit in support of the application for an extension of time, the applicant suggests that leave to appeal was granted on 5 June 2007 (the date of the decision of the FMCA), I am satisfied that this is an error due to the applicant's misunderstanding of the necessary procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It may be assumed that the applicant would make an application for leave if she appreciated it was necessary to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In the circumstances I will treat her application for extension of time as also indicating a desire to obtain leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 The application before the Court was accompanied by an affidavit in which the only substantive content was as follows:
 
 'I was advised by the recipient that they received outcome letter from the Federal Magistrate Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">But it is too late for me to lodge application to the Federal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I am late to lodge the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I applied for extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Hope you could take my application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I fear to go back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I was persecuted in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">If I return, I would be put in jail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 
 

5 There was no basis disclosed by the application, therefore, on which an application for an extension of time could be granted or leave to appeal be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">No explanation for the delay was offered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Under O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court of Australia Rules an application for leave to appeal must be made within 21 days after judgment was pronounced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant did not make an application until more than three months had passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Her present application to this Court was liable, for that reason alone, to be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">6 The applicant did not appear at the hearing of her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I permitted the Minister's representative to file material showing advice of the date for hearing the application and service of the Minister's written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Minister's representative asked that I dismiss the application pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I was satisfied that was an appropriate course as it allows a further opportunity to engage the jurisdiction of the Court should the absence of the applicant prove to be by reason of circumstances beyond her control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">However, in my view, it was desirable that any such right be exercised within a reasonable time --- i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">before the end of April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I made an order to that effect and directed that further documents not be accepted for filing from the applicant after that time unless the leave of a judge was obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">7 At the request of the Minister's representative I made an order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In the circumstances as these appear at the moment such an order is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Associate:

 Counsel for the Applicant: The applicant did not appear 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: DLA Phillips Fox
