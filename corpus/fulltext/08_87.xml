<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 20 December 2007 on the application of the cross-respondent, Brivis Australia Pty Ltd (Brivis), I made an order that the cross-claimant, Seeley International Pty Ltd (Seeley), make further and better discovery of customer complaint files and service repair records of Seeley for the period between 1992 and April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">At that time I said that I would provide brief reasons for that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These are my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The cross-respondent's application for further and better discovery was particularised in a letter from its solicitors to the cross-claimant's solicitors dated 19 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Relevantly, the cross-respondent sought:
 
 Complaint files and service repair records discovered by the cross-claimant and referred to at page 295 of the Judgment of O'Loughlin J in the proceedings between the cross-claimant and Newtronics in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">

3 The cross-respondent was in fact referring to [295] of the reasons for judgment of O'Loughlin J in Seeley International Pty Ltd v Newtronics Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1862.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I will return to that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The cross-claim in this proceeding was brought after the cross-claimant was successful on the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The cross-claimant asserts that the cross-respondent, by claiming that it had valid patents, had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) or made false or misleading representations in contravention of s 53 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The cross-claimant claims, as a result of those contraventions, that it has suffered loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In particular, it claims that, by reason of the cross-respondent's false claims that it had a valid patent, the cross-respondent's share of the Australian market for domestic fixed evaporative airconditioners increased and the cross-claimant's market share decreased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Further, it claims that the cross-claimant has suffered loss and damage by reason of the diversion of sales from the cross-claimant to the cross-respondent and a consequential loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 In paragraph 8 of the cross-claim it is pleaded:
 
 The cross-claimant has since 1994 manufactured and offered for sale a range of rooftop evaporative air conditioners incorporating a sloping base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Between 1994 and December 1998, the Breezair EM and ES series;
 (b) Since December 1998, the Breezair Mirage range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 

6 The cross-claim asserts that the false and misleading conduct occurred between September 1997 and April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 At the hearing of this application, counsel for the cross-respondent, Mr Caine SC, stated that the cross-claimant's claim for damages was confined to the period December 1998 and April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">That, of course, is consistent with paragraph 8 of the cross-claim, although paragraph 8 recognises that the cross-claimant has manufactured units since 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">8 The proceeding before O'Loughlin J was brought by the cross-claimant against a third party for damages arising out of the supply of defective parts was the cross-claimant's claim in that proceeding that a number of units caught fire as a result of the supply of defective parts which gave rise to the necessity to recall the units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was said that the recall gave rise to adverse publicity, as a result of which it was said the cross-claimant suffered damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">9 In that proceeding, the Court was called upon to consider the quality of the product manufactured by the cross-claimant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">O'Loughlin J said at [295]:
 
 Seeley maintained records of the complaints that they received about their units ("the complaint files").</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They also maintained details of all warranty services that their dealers and distributors carried out to their units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is not a pretty picture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Seeley's Service Repair Records ("SRRs") were the company's computerised internal records of the occasions when the company was required to organise repairs to their products during a warranty period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">A CD-ROM containing the particulars of the SRRs from 1992 to 1998 was discovered by Seeley and its contents were analysed by Newtronics' advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Seeley, who was cross-examined about the resulting analyses, admitted that he was not familiar with the detail of the SRRs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">However, he did accept certain propositions that were put to him by the cross-examiner which, in my assessment, were quite significant, as the following passage from his evidence reveals:
 
 
 "If I was to put to you that in 1993-1994, though you sold 11,000 units there were only 466 warranty claims, would you know whether that sounds right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It wouldn't sound right to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It's the sort of thing I would hope for but not what I would expect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 What about 1994-1995 where there was 15,859 units sold, according to the disk, and 4668 warranty calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Does that sound right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">... Yes, that could be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 So it's about one in three.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Would that be right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It could be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 So would you expect then one in every three units sold would require a warranty call within 12 months or two years, depending on the length of the warranty?</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">... Would I expect ... 
 
 Would you expect that to happen?</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I expect that could happen, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 So something goes wrong with one out of every three units within the warranty period?</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">... Yes, that could happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 Is that what happens?</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">I'm saying it could.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I'm not that close to the business, I've stepped back from it, but it would not surprise me that that was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 If it was, however, 16,542 units and 9252 warranty calls, would that surprise you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">... That would be high but I think it has to be looked at with respect to two considerations, and one is that we did increase warranty periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Originally they were one year and subsequently it was increased to two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It has subsequently been increased to three.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">That extends your warranty rate substantially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 When do you say it was increased to three years?</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">When did I say it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 When was it increased to three years?</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">...I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I can't give you a precise date but I'm saying that that's my understanding of where it is at the moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 So that if in 1996-97 there were 16,000 units sold and 15,000 warranty calls that could be because some of the warranties were for previous years, or even two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Is that what you're saying?</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" 
 

10 It is clear from his Honour's reasons that service repair records existed at least between 1992 and 1998 because they were discovered in that proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">11 In this proceeding the cross-claimant has discovered in paper form, customer complaints records for a period between December 1998 and April 2004 which is said to be the period over which the cross-claimant has suffered damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">12 The cross-respondent argued, however, that notwithstanding the cross-claimant had limited its claim for damages for the period December 1998 to April 2004, the quality of the cross-claimant's product prior to that time was relevant in determining whether the cross-claimant's share of the market was already in decline prior to the impugned conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It was contended that, having regarding to O'Loughlin J's remarks and findings, it could not be assumed that the cross-claimant's product was reliable during the period with which O'Loughlin J was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">13 The cross-claimant contended that the defence to the cross-claim did not raise the issue for which further and better discovery was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It was put that there was simply a bare denial that the cross-claimant had suffered damage which was not sufficient to raise any other issues: O 11 r 10 of the Federal Court of Australia Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">14 The cross-respondent indicated that it would be applying for leave to amend the defence to include a positive plea which would assert that any loss of market share suffered by the cross-claimant was not caused by any representations made by the cross-respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However, the cross-respondent asserted that, on the pleadings as they presently stand, even where the cross-respondent has raised only a bare denial, the documents sought were discoverable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">15 I was of the opinion that the documents were discoverable because, where there is a bare denial that the cross-claimant has suffered the loss of market share for the reasons complained of, these documents were likely to be documents which might adversely affect the cross-claimant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">16 It was put by the cross-claimant that the cross-claimant will need only to establish that the cross-respondent's conduct was "a cause" of the cross-claimant's damages: I&amp;L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The cross-claimant, of course, will not have to establish that the cross-respondent's conduct was the only cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The question will be whether the contravention was a cause of the cross-claimant's loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the plea as it presently stands allows the cross-respondent to say that the issue whether the cross-respondent's conduct was "a cause" has been raised and, in those circumstances, documents which might be adverse to the cross-claimant's case should be discovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">17 For those reasons, I made the order to which I have already referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
