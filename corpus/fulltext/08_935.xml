<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Companies have always been required to keep registers of their members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The register is a public document which is open for inspection by a member without charge and by any other person upon payment of a fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">When copies are requested they must be provided in exchange for a fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The provisions dealing with the maintenance of and access to registers are currently found in Chapter 2C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">According to the Attorney-General these provisions were intended to facilitate "rapid and easy access" by the public to a company's register and to do so "at reasonable cost": Second Reading Speech, First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 (Cth) (House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (1995) vol HR 199), pp 709, 712.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The issue in this case is about the quantum of the fee that can be charged for a copy of the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Each side engaged senior counsel to put its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Experts have been called to give their views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Witnesses have been examined and cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The cost to each party is in the tens of thousands of dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">So much for easy access at a reasonable cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">2 The facts, so far as they are relevant, are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The defendant, AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd, is a public company whose shares are quoted on the ASX.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The plaintiff, Direct Share Purchasing Corporation Ltd, makes unsolicited offers to purchase shares in listed companies, usually at below market price or on terms that are unfavourable to the selling shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Only the very vulnerable or unsophisticated would ever accept these offers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The offers are in writing and posted to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">To discover the identity and addresses of the shareholders the plaintiff needs access to the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">3 On 7 January 2008, the plaintiff's agent wrote to AXA requesting a copy of its register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Enclosed with the letter was a cheque for $20,000 to cover the fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The letter stated that the amount would significantly exceed the maximum prescribed amount under the Act and requested a refund of the difference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">4 AXA does not maintain its own register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It has retained Computershare Investor Services Pty Ltd to keep the register on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The propriety of a company arranging for some other person to keep its register has been recognised at least since the Uniform Companies Acts 1961 : see ss 152 and 154 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">AXA notified Computershare of the plaintiff's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It told Computershare: "At this stage, we are trying to work out how we can legally refuse to provide the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" In the meantime it obtained from ASIC an extension of the time within which to comply with the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 173(3) of the Act provides that a copy of the register must be provided within seven days unless ASIC extends the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The reason for ASIC's intervention is not known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I guess it was because for good reason ASIC does not look with favour upon Mr Tweed, who is behind the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">5 As events turned out, the plaintiff withdrew its request and made another request on 16 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This time it requested that the copy of the register be provided "on floppy disk (or CD Rom), in Microsoft [E]xcel format, comma delineated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">AXA instructed its lawyers to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">They advised the plaintiff that their client was "mindful of its obligations under Part 2C.1 of the Act and is entirely supportive of the proper use of the information contained in the company's register of members".</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Nonetheless they sought from the plaintiff an undertaking not to use the register except as "is relevant to the holding of the interests recorded in the register or the exercise of the rights attaching to them".</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">No doubt the solicitors had in mind s 177(1) which limits the use of information contained in the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It is interesting to compare this section with rules laid down in R v Wilts and Berks Canal Navigation (1874) 29 LT 922; compare R v Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Railway Company (1852) 21 LJQB 284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">6 In due course the plaintiff gave the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Then, on 23 January 2008, AXA provided the plaintiff with a CD Rom containing the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The CD Rom was not in comma delineated format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Instead, the CD Rom was in PDF format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">AXA charged a fee of $17,195.39 for providing the CD Rom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It received payment by deducting that amount from the money in hand and returning the difference to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The question in issue is whether AXA was entitled to charge this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">7 No question arises regarding the permissibility of AXA providing the CD Rom in PDF format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I observe that s 1306(1) permits a company to maintain all registers on a computer and that s 1306(4) provides that where a copy must be provided it must be in "a document containing a clear reproduction in writing" of the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">However, s 173(3) states that "[i]f the register is kept on a computer and the person asks for the data on floppy disk, the company ... must give the data to the person on floppy disk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The data must be readable but the floppy disk need not be formatted for the person's preferred operating system".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">8 A floppy disk is a portable computer storage device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It stores data magnetically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">These discs are flexible, low in cost and easy to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">But they have been rapidly replaced by newer and better technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Since the late 1990s the CD Rom has become the standard means of storing and transferring data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">USB flash drives and DVD Roms are also gaining popularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">If it is not yet entirely obsolete soon the floppy disk will be a thing of the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Fortunately, the parties here have proceeded on the basis that the statutory obligation to provide a copy of a register that is kept on a computer can be satisfied by the provision of the register on a CD Rom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">9 Access to a register which is stored on a computer has obvious advantages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">One is the ease with which the information can be used and manipulated, especially if it is in a comma delineated format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">On the other hand, if the information is reproduced in a different format, such as PDF, it is not capable of being used and manipulated as easily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It requires specialist software for that purpose which may be quite expensive to acquire and time consuming to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">10 There are many circumstances in which a company may not want a person to have easy use of its register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Some may be morally defensible and some may not be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Several examples follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Shareholders may be the target of an unwelcome off-market bid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">A director in dispute with the board may wish to write to shareholders to advance his or her position or to attack an opposing view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">If a company refuses to convene a meeting of members following a requisition for that purpose, a shareholder may wish to convene the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In each of these examples (and many others can be thought of) the company may wish to make it difficult for the person wanting to contact members and so may supply the register in a difficult to use format.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It is, I think, quite unsatisfactory that the legislation allows a company to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">On one view it is inconsistent with the purpose of having a public register of members that a company can decide when and to whom it will provide a useful copy of its register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I appreciate that the original object of access to a register was to enable creditors to discover the identity of shareholders and the extent to which they were liable to contribute to the company's capital: Oakes v Turquand (1867) LR 2 HL 325, 366.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Things have moved on since then and the legitimate reasons for access are now much wider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">11 The problem with the legislation that is in issue in this case is of a different order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The fee that a company is permitted to charge for a copy of its register is regulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Section 173(3) provides the company must give a person a copy of the register (or a part of the register) if a person asks for a copy and "pays any fee (up to the prescribed amount) required by the company".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) (the Regulations) specify that in the case of a register kept on a computer the fee that can be charged is "a reasonable amount that does not exceed the marginal cost to the company of providing a copy": reg 1.1.01 and sch 4, item 3(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In other words, the fee must satisfy two conditions: (1) it must be a reasonable amount; and (2) the amount must not exceed the marginal cost to the company of providing a copy of the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">12 I propose to deal first with the second condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">On this topic, I have had the assistance of Dr Williams, formerly Professor of Law and Economics in the Melbourne Business School and now chairman of Frontier Economics Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He was called by AXA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">That it was necessary to call Dr Williams, one of Australia's leading economists, for purposes of deciding what is an appropriate fee to charge for a copy of a register is the fault of the legislation, not the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">13 According to Dr Williams, and it could hardly be challenged, the term "marginal cost" is a technical term of economics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He explained that its meaning has been settled for over 100 years and is not the subject of any debate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I would go so far as to say almost every student of elementary economics (and many judges who know only a little of economics) understands what the concept means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Marginal cost is the cost of producing or supplying one more unit of output, whether the output is a good or a service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">While it seems to be a simple enough concept, its application is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">First of all it is necessary to know something about cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The cost of production or supply can be divided into two categories: fixed costs and variable costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Fixed costs are those that do not vary with output; they would continue even if there was no output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The cost of plant and equipment, tax, interest on loans, depreciation and fixed overheads are common examples of fixed costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Variable costs, by contrast, change with output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Typically they include raw materials, wages, transportation costs and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Marginal cost, then, is a function of variable costs alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">14 Marginal cost may be easy to define in theory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">But it is notoriously difficult and exceedingly expensive to calculate in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Two of the problems, among many, are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">First, it is necessary to decide which costs are to be classified as fixed and which are variable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">This is a topic about which views will differ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The second problem is how one should account for joint or common costs when multiple products or services are supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Moreover, for analytical purposes marginal cost has its shortcomings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The problem is that marginal cost will vary from one moment to the next and between wide extremes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">One reason is that the cost of production constantly changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Another is that the circumstances of production may differ from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">15 All competition lawyers are familiar with the concept of marginal cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">At one time predatory pricing was defined as charging a price below that of marginal cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That approach did not survive for long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">According to Professor Hovenkamp the reason was that "[m]arginal cost generally cannot be computed in litigation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He explained that "[t]he primary value of marginal cost ... is conceptual": H Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and its Practice (2 nd ed, 1999) at 337.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">See also William Inglis &amp; Sons Baking Co v ITT Continental Baking Company Inc 668 F 2 d 1014 (1982).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">When Dr Williams was giving his evidence I suggested that "marginal cost" found its way into the Regulations because its difficulty of application was not appreciated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Prompted by my comment, Dr Williams said: "It is astonishing [that marginal cost] is in the statute at all".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">16 The facts of this case put in stark relief the problem of having marginal cost stand as a cap to a reasonable fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As I have mentioned, AXA's register is kept by Computershare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">This imposes upon Computershare both the obligation to make the register available for inspection and to provide a copy to any person entitled to receive a copy: s 174.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is, I think, implicit in the legislation that the satisfaction by Computershare of its obligations is the means by which the company itself satisfies its duty to do those things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">17 As the evidence shows the marginal cost to Computershare of providing a company register is not great, but the marginal cost to AXA is substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is necessary to explain why.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">For Computershare the work involved in producing a CD Rom containing the register consists of keying instructions into a computer, waiting for the report to run, downloading the information onto a CD Rom and sending the CD Rom to AXA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The variable costs incurred are the cost of an administrative staff member operating the computer, the cost of purchasing a CD Rom and the cost of delivering the CD Rom to the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The evidence of Ms Guyer, Computershare's State Manager for Victoria, suggests that the cost is likely to be no more than $100 --- $150.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">18 On the other hand, the cost to AXA is much higher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Dr Williams explained that the marginal cost to AXA of providing a copy of the CD Rom is the cost of acquiring the copy of the register on the CD Rom plus the cost of making the arrangements to obtain the copy and send it to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The cost of the CD Rom is regulated by the Registry Services Agreement pursuant to which Computershare provides share registry and other services to AXA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">According to that agreement Computershare was entitled to charge $17,195.39 for supplying the CD Rom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Why is the fee so high?</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I do not think there is a sinister explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">AXA has online access to the register as part of the services provided by Computershare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">If it needs to send information to shareholders Computershare undertakes the task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Thus AXA has no need for a copy of its register, save in exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Indeed, in the last four or five years it has only requested four copies, one for its major shareholder and the other three for the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In the first example the fee charged by AXA was passed on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In these circumstances AXA has little incentive to bargain down the rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">19 By the same token I am sure Computershare would have agreed to take less for providing a copy of the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Under its contract, Computershare receives around $1.3 million per annum for its services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Ms Guyer suggested that charging a high fee for one service was an example of cross-subsidisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It is true that on the demand side, multiple products or services are often used to subsidise one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I do not, however, accept that there was any expectation for cross-subsidisation from a service so rarely used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">20 We can now see the problem of applying the concept of marginal cost to the facts at hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The marginal cost to Computershare of producing a copy of the register on a CD Rom is less than $100 (my own calculation based on the evidence of Ms Guyer is that it is around $50).</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The marginal cost to AXA is in excess of $17,195.39; the price paid to Computershare is only part of the marginal cost, the balance has not been worked out either because the amount is so small or because the task is too difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">This is in circumstances where AXA does nothing more than receive the CD Rom from Computershare and send it to the plaintiff, the cost of which cannot be more than a dollar or two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">21 I can now deal with the principal issue in dispute which is whether the fee charged by AXA is a reasonable amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Ordinarily one would begin by examining the market price for CD Roms containing a register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">There is no evidence, however, of any market for the supply of such a product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">22 In the absence of a market price, the price paid by the supplier of the product can sometimes be a useful guide to what is a reasonable fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That price would, however, only be useful if it were arrived at in negotiations where the supplier was attempting to purchase the product at the lowest possible price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Self-evidently that is not true of the price paid by AXA, at least as regards the provision under its agreement with Computershare of a copy of the register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">23 Another method of determining what is a reasonable fee to charge is the cost of production plus (if it were not otherwise included) a reasonable return on capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">That is how price is set in a competitive market to give the producer enough profit to maintain his or her investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It would, of course, be necessary to specify what costs are to be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The costs might be limited to variable costs or, as I would prefer, include fixed costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">There is simply no evidence in this case upon which such a calculation can be based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">24 What I do have is the evidence of Mr Farrelly, an information technology expert called by the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Farrelly has considerable experience in managing document databases for clients which are of similar size to AXA's register of members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">A typical fee charged to supply a CD Rom copy of the data is between $50 and $300.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Mr Farrelly also undertook a rough assessment of what it would cost Computershare to produce a copy of the register (if the work was performed by an employee).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">His estimate was a rather generous $480.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He also made an assessment of how much an external consultant would charge Computershare for producing a copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">He assumed the external consultant would charge a one day fee regardless of how long the task took.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">He said the fee would be between $1500 and $2200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">25 In my view a reasonable (if somewhat generous) fee to charge for the CD Rom supplied to the plaintiff is $250.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I accept that this amount is something of judicial guesswork but the evidence does not permit me to be any more precise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In arriving at a fee of $250 I have had regard to the fact that the CD Rom was in PDF format and difficult to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">26 In the circumstances there will be orders that AXA refund the plaintiff the sum of $16,945.39 and pay the costs of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
