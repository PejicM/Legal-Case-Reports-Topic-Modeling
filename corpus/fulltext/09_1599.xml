<sentence id="s0">
 Vulcan Resources Ltd ( Vulcan ) wishes to merge with Universal Resources Ltd ( Universal ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In order to achieve that purpose, Vulcan hopes to complete a Scheme of Arrangement between it and its ordinary share holding members pursuant to the provisions of Pt 5.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Approval of the Court is sought today under s 411 of the Act to enable that process to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The application is supported by affidavits from Mr Hughes who is Vulcan's Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary and Mr Cardaci, Solicitor for Vulcan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The evidence in support of Vulcan's application indicates that Vulcan's Directors and Universal's Directors have agreed upon the merger and have formed the opinion that the most efficient method of securing that outcome is pursuant to the Scheme for which s 411 of the Act approval is sought so as to put the Scheme to shareholders in Vulcan for their consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">An 'arrangement' under a Scheme is a broad notion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">As observed in Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137 at [26]; it may extend to any subject matter which is something a company is able to agree with its members, and is likened to a contract between a company and its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Typically, such a scheme will have some elements that are compulsory for its members, if it is approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In this case, there are such elements, such as the requirement that all members transfer their shares in exchange for new shares in a new holding company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">This will be on a ratio of 1 Vulcan share to 6.85 Universal shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">If the Scheme becomes effective and the merger is achieved, Vulcan will thereby become a 100 per cent subsidiary of Universal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) has received the requisite notice and information under s 411(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It has been provided with the Scheme Booklet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Scheme Booklet contains a proposed Scheme, a final draft Explanatory Statement with annexures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It contains the relevant independent expert's report and the proposed Notice of Meeting and form of proxy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I am satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the materials and ASIC has indicated that it does not oppose the making of the orders which are sought nor does it wish to be heard in relation to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I take into account these facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I am satisfied that the Scheme Booklet which comprises the Explanatory Statement appears to comply with the provisions of the Act in the sense of giving the necessary information such that a member could make an informed decision whether or not to approve the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Over and above that, it provides additional information consistent with that which would be required under Ch 6 of the Act in the context of a takeover bid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is an independent expert's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That report confirms the Scheme is fair and reasonable and that it is in the best interests of Scheme participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">As Mr Hughes deposes, Vulcan and all its option holders as well as Universal have entered into private treaties by which Vulcan and the option holders in Vulcan have agreed to the cancellation of their options in consideration for Universal issuing fully paid ordinary shares in Universal to each option holder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The completion of that transaction will occur if the Scheme becomes effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is also confirmed that if orders are made today that a meeting of creditors will be held to approve the Scheme, the Scheme Booklet will be registered with ASIC and sent together with the Notice of Meeting and form of proxy to all Vulcan members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is nothing in the Constitution of Vulcan which is apparently inconsistent with or contrary to the terms of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There is no reason to think that the Scheme has been proposed by either Vulcan or Universal for the purpose of enabling those companies to void the operation of Ch 6 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There are a number of other aspects concerning the Scheme to which the Court's attention has appropriately been drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">For present purposes, there is no reason to believe that any of them raise a difficulty, nor does it appear that ASIC is of that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">They include the mechanics of the mutual obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The warranty of unencumbered title is high-lighted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The reciprocal 'break-fees' in the merger implementation agreement arise from normal commercial merger negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">They are apparently within the reasonable bounds of the Takeover's Panel Guidance Note 7, (that is, not more than one per cent of equity value).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The parties have each been separately advised and represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The 'no-shop' constraints in the merger implementation agreement are subject to an exception for performance of fiduciary duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">CONCLUSION 
 In the circumstances, this ex parte application being a first stage of the process, I am satisfied that the proposed Scheme, if it achieves the statutory majority at the members' meeting is one which the Court would be likely to finally approve on an unopposed hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Accordingly, I will make the orders as sought in the minute as follows: Pursuant to section 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 ("Act"), the Plaintiff convene a meeting of its Shareholders ("Scheme Meeting") at King Street Room, Rydges Perth, Corner King &amp; Hay Streets, Perth, Western Australia at 10.00 am (WST) on Friday 29 January 2010 for the purpose of considering and if thought fit approving, with or without modification, the Scheme, a copy of which is attached as Annexure 2 to the final draft document entitled "Scheme Booklet" (Vulcan Resources Limited ACN 100 072 624) ("Scheme Booklet") which is annexed as annexure "EEH6" to the affidavit of Eric Edwards Hughes sworn 10 December 2009 in support of the Originating Process; Pursuant to section 1319 of the Act, the Scheme Meeting be convened, held and conducted in accordance with the provisions of:
