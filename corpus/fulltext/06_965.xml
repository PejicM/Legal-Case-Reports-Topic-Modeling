1 Michael Seymour was found guilty of professional misconduct and struck off the roll of solicitors by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In 1990 he was convicted of driving with a 'high range PCA', fined $800 and disqualified from driving for 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In 1993 he applied to become a migration agent under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') falsely stating in his application that he had never had a conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His application was granted in April 1994 and he has practiced as a migration agent ever since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In September 1994, Mr Seymour consented to an injunction by the Supreme Court restraining him from acting or purporting to act as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In 1997 he was acquitted of a charge of contempt of that injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The acquittal was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">But in 2000, Mr Seymour acted as a solicitor in a conveyancing transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He was again charged in the Supreme Court with contempt of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He pleaded guilty on 31 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In his plea, Mr Seymour also gave evidence to Buddin J that he had never had a conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Buddin J convicted him and imposed a suspended sentence of 9 months imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 In the meantime on 1 May 2004 he had made his annual application for renewal of his registration as a migration agent in which he stated, relevantly, that he had not been found guilty of a criminal offence and that he was not currently the subject of any criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He did not inform the Migration Agents Registration Authority of his conviction by Buddin J after that had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Authority refused to reregister Mr Seymour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal came to the same conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It found that Mr Seymour's contempt was a criminal offence and he had been obliged to disclose to the authority, first, in his 2004 application the then pending charge and, later, his conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The tribunal decided that Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person to be registered as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">4 In that context Mr Seymour has raised the following as questions of law in this appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') namely:
 
 
 (a) Was his conviction for contempt by the Supreme Court of New South Wales a conviction ' of a criminal offence ' pursuant to s 290(2)(c) of the Act or ' of an offence under a law ... of a State ... ' pursuant to s 312(1)(e) of the Act?</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">(b) Did the tribunal have power, after it held that the original decision maker acted without power, to review, on the merits, and to exercise the original decision maker's power to refuse to renew Mr Seymour's registration as a migration agent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 

(c) Was the tribunal's decision the correct and preferable decision?</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">BACKGROUND 
 
5 The ultimate question for the tribunal was whether it was entitled to form the view that it was not satisfied that Mr Seymour was a fit and proper person to give migration assistance or was not a person of integrity so that it was not entitled to register him as a migration agent pursuant to s 290(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The circumstances in which that issue fell to be determined were as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 On 14 April 1982 Mr Seymour had been struck off the rolls as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales after he had been found guilty of professional misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 On 1 November 1990 Mr Seymour had been convicted of driving with more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol, the offence being known as a ' high range PCA ' and was fined $800 and disqualified from driving for 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 On 8 February 1993 Mr Seymour applied to the Migration Agents Registration Board ('the Board') for registration as a migration agent under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">That application was granted after the Board, without disclosure by Mr Seymour, became aware through its enquiries of the high range PCA offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">As part of his application, Mr Seymour had consented to the Board obtaining information from the Australian Federal Police, both from its own records and any other police force or other authority, of any criminal charge involving him or pending before any court together with details of any conviction or finding of guilt which may have been recorded against his name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The information about Mr Seymour's high range PCA offence and possible bankruptcy was received by the Board on or about 16 March 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 On 18 March 1994, Mr Seymour attended a meeting with five members of the Board in Canberra which lasted for approximately 31/2 hours during the course of which no reference was made to the Board's information that he had been convicted of the high range PCA offence, notwithstanding that in his application he had falsely said that he had not been the subject of a conviction or finding of guilt or a pecuniary penalty before a court that was not spent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 On 15 April 1994 Mr Seymour was registered, and thereafter continued to remain registered and to practice as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">11 On 5 September 1994 Mr Seymour agreed to orders being made by to the Supreme Court of New South Wales that he would not in future act or purport to act as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding the giving of those orders were not before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The consent orders made by Blanch J on 5 September 1994 included an order in the following terms:
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">[Mr Seymour] be restrained, from acting, or purporting to act, as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 


 
 12 By letter dated 1 May 2004 Mr Seymour applied for 'repeat registration' as a migration agent to the Authority, which had succeeded to similar functions to that of the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mr Seymour completed the questionnaire for re-registration, critically, giving the following information in relation to Item 23:
 
 
 ' 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The following statements relate to section 290 of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 
 
 
 
 i.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">There has not been a finding of guilt against me for a criminal offence that has not previously been declared to the Migration Agents Registration Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I am not currently the subject of any criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">' (emphasis in original) 
 
 
 
 

13 By an internal memo dated 28 May 2004, the Authority was informed of the fact that the Law Society had ' taken ' Mr Seymour to the Supreme Court for acting as a solicitor of which fact, the Authority noted, he had not informed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">14 On 3 June 2004 Buddin J, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales found Mr Seymour to be guilty of contempt pursuant to a statement of charge filed in accordance with Pt 55 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), on a plea of guilty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The basis of the finding of guilt of contempt was that Mr Seymour had breached the order set out above made by that court in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">His Honour sentenced Mr Seymour to a term of imprisonment of 9 months, the execution of which was suspended upon condition that he entered into a good behaviour bond for the period of 9 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">His Honour ordered Mr Seymour to pay the costs of the proceedings before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It will be necessary to return to the details of that matter below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">15 On 14 February 2005 the Authority refused Mr Seymour's application for re-registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">16 On 17 February 2005 Mr Seymour brought an application for review of that decision in the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The application asserted that the Authority had wrongly decided that Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person pursuant to s 290 of the Act in refusing to re-register him as a migration agent and that in doing so he had been denied procedural fairness and natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">17 In the proceedings before the tribunal, Exhibit R3 was a statement by an officer of the Authority, which noted that when Mr Seymour was advised by letter dated 30 September 2003 that his application for re-registration had been successful and reminded him of his obligations to inform the Authority in writing of any events prescribed in s 312(1) of the Act as soon as reasonably possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The statement went on to assert that the records of the Authority had been examined including for the period prior to 30 September 2003 and that they did not contain any written advice from Mr Seymour to the Authority of any proceedings having been brought against him by the Law Society of New South Wales or of the decision by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, namely that of Buddin J which had been the basis of the Authority's refusal of his application for re-registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">18 On 27 January 2006 the tribunal ordered that the decision under review be set aside, because it was a nullity since the original decision maker had had no delegation to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The tribunal then substituted in lieu its own decision that Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person to be registered as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">STATUTORY BACKGROUND

<sentence id="s60">' 
 


 THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS 
 
20 The tribunal commenced its reasons by setting out the relevant portions of s 290 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It then referred to the explanation of what the term ' fit and proper person ' connoted in the decisions of Hill J in Davies v Australian Securities Commission (1995) 59 FCR 221 at 232D-233B; (131 ALR 295 at 305) and Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 380.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">21 The tribunal then set out what it described as the " specifics " of the complaint against Mr Seymour contained in paragraph 5 of the Authority's statement of facts and contentions, which it noted read:
 
 
 '5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That decision was supported by findings made in relation to the following four areas of conduct: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.1 The applicant's conduct that led to his being sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months [suspended under s.12(1)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.2 The applicant's conduct in declaring that he was not the subject of any criminal proceeding, when in fact he was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.3 The applicant's conduct in not disclosing a conviction in his 1993 registration application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.4 The applicant's conduct in not notifying the Authority that he had been convicted of an offence as required by s.312(1)(e) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 
 
 

22 The tribunal noted that at the commencement of the hearing Mr Seymour challenged the validity of the decision that had been made by a body which described itself as the Professional Standards &amp; Registration Sub-Committee of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The tribunal referred to its earlier ex tempore decision in which it had ruled that the sub-committee had not been given a delegation in writing pursuant to s 319A of the Act and that therefore its decision was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The tribunal noted that pursuant to Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 41 FLR 338; 41 ALR 307 and Z ubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 it had jurisdiction to review the impugned decision and in doing so could exercise all the powers and discretions of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Tribunal dealt with the first of the Authority's contentions by reciting the facts the subject of the institution of the contempt proceedings before Buddin J and noting the plea of guilt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">After recording his Honour's orders, the Tribunal continued: 
 
 '12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Buddin J in his judgment refers to the circumstances of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It would appear that the Applicant acted for a client in the purchase of a property and that the solicitor for the vendor assumed that the Applicant was a solicitor and the Applicant did not disabuse the vendor's solicitor of that assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">As Buddin J said in his judgment at paragraph 6: 
 
 
 
 "...</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I have no difficulty in accepting Ms Doolin's evidence that had she known that the offender was not a solicitor, she would have approached her dealings with him quite differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I accept that she would not have, for example, permitted him to act as her firm's agent on settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Nor is it likely that she would have forwarded the signed transfer to him in the circumstances in which she did, or at least not without having first obtained instructions about the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">" 
 
 
 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The circumstances which led to the orders of Blanch J were not before me and the Applicant was vague when asked to recount the events leading to the proceedings before Blanch J in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I find that a clear inference is that the Applicant did purport to act as a solicitor, hence the nature of the orders made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In the course of his judgment, Buddin J referred to proceedings before Barr J in 1997 where the Law Society of New South Wales had sought orders from the Supreme Court that the Applicant was in contempt of that Court for failing to comply with the orders of Blanch J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">There were in those proceedings, three transactions in which the Applicant's conduct was alleged to have constituted breaches of the orders made by Blanch J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">That Notice of Motion was dismissed by Barr J and an appeal against his decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 3 May 1999 (see Law Society of New South Wales v Seymour [1999] NSWCA 117).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">As Buddin J pointed out, the significance of those proceedings was that only just over 12 months after those proceedings were brought to finality in his favour, the Applicant embarked upon the activities which gave rise to the proceedings before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">' 


 
23 The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course, including Attorney General (NSW) v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314; Whitham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been brought with the purpose of punishing Mr Seymour noting that it had been common ground, as Buddin J recorded in his reasons, that the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term, as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The tribunal then said:
 
 '24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Therefore whilst not free from doubt, I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs 5.2 and 5.4 of the Respondent's Statement of Facts and Contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">' 


 
24 There was debate in the submissions before me as to whether this was a finding that the contentions of the authority in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 had been accepted by the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I think that this is the better view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That is to say that the tribunal appears to have accepted that, once it resolved that the proceedings had been criminal, the complaints in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 had been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">25 The tribunal then discussed the contention put forward by Mr Seymour that he had believed that the proceedings before Buddin J were not criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The position adopted by Mr Seymour before the tribunal had been that the contempt for which he had been found guilty by Buddin J was in the category described in the authorities as ' civil contempt ' as distinct from criminal contempt and that by reason of that matter Mr Seymour asserted that he believed that their outcome did not fall within the definitions within the meaning of the expression ' criminal offence ' in either of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The tribunal found that it did not accept that that belief should have resulted in Mr Seymour failing to notify the Authority of either the fact that the proceedings were on foot or of the conviction or sentence (see [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">26 The tribunal then went on to say: 
 
 '27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As pointed out by Fitzgerald JA who gave the judgment of the Court in Law Society of New South Wales v Seymour (supra), the present Applicant objected to the competency of the Law Society to appeal based on the premise that the proceedings for contempt, in which the Law Society had sought to have him found guilty and punished was a criminal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It was further argued that he had been acquitted of the charge of contempt and that no appeal lay from such a verdict (see paragraph 5 of the judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Unfortunately for the present purposes, the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to rule upon that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Whatever the Applicant's real belief may have been, if he was to be regarded as a person in whom the Respondent could place reliance, it was incumbent upon him to make full disclosure of the proceedings against him and of the findings and orders of Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">One of the Applicant's character witnesses referred to his taking a technical approach to the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Although it may be regarded as consistent with that approach, to argue before the Court of Appeal that he had been convicted of a criminal contempt and then to argue before me that the contempt was civil and therefore he was under no obligation to notify the Respondent pursuant to ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(c) [scil: (e)] of the Act, I totally reject that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 
 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">I find that such a narrow and opportunistic approach regarding his responsibilities to the Respondent indicates a lack of candour and openness which negates a finding that that Applicant can be regarded as a person of integrity and fit and proper to be licensed as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">' 


 
27 Again there was debate before me as to whether the findings set out above were ones which related to paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 of the Authority's contentions or whether they represented an independent consideration by the tribunal of the overall fitness of the applicant in circumstances where the tribunal was considering the alternative situation were its conclusion incorrect that the proceedings before Buddin J had resulted in a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Such a consideration would be relevant to the ultimate question under s 290(1) and to the fact that s 290(2)(h) must require the tribunal to take into account ' any other matter relevant to the applicant's fitness to give immigration assistance '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I am of opinion that the tribunal in this part of its reasoning was considering the matter as a true alternative to its earlier finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">28 Next, the tribunal considered the Authority's contention in paragraph 5.3, namely the failure to disclose the high range PCA offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Tribunal said that it did not regard the offence itself as having any materiality whatsoever, but, it went on to say that it was no answer to the gravamen of the charge that Mr Seymour had not disclosed this conviction even though he had consented to the Australian Federal Police checking his criminal record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The tribunal found that that was not the disclosure required by s 290(2) of the Act and that the high range PCA offence was, in 1993, a conviction which Mr Seymour was required then to disclose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 The tribunal noted that Mr Seymour had adduced a large number of referees attesting to his fitness to practice as a migration agent and found that he was a person whom his contemporaries regarded as having real moral worth, after referring to Malindi v The Queen [1967] 1 AC 439 at 451.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The tribunal concluded as follows: 
 
 '37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Notwithstanding his referees' views as to his character, and I note that at least one was most discomforted when the full import of Buddin J's decision was made known to him, the Applicant cannot escape his history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">He is a person who in 1982 was struck off as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In 1994, for reasons not explained to me, he gave undertakings to the Supreme Court of NSW that he would not in future act or purport to act as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In 2004 he was convicted and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond, for purporting to act as a solicitor in breach of his undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">As far as I am concerned, those facts alone would be sufficient to render the Applicant not a fit and proper person whether the contempt was criminal or civil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Added to those facts are the other facts that the Applicant committed his contempt not only after giving undertakings but within 12 months of proceedings regarding other alleged similar breaches of his undertaking, albeit those proceedings were resolved in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Then, although having previously argued that the similar contempt proceedings were criminal, he declined to notify the Respondent of his conviction for contempt on 3 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Previously, he had neglected to inform the Respondent himself of a conviction in 1990 for a driving offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">
 
 39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Taken all together, I find that the Applicant is not a person of integrity nor is he a fit and proper person for the purposes of s 290 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">' 
 
 SUBMISSIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS 
 
30 On behalf Mr Seymour it was submitted that the procedure used before Buddin J followed the scheme in SCR Pt 55 r 6-13 and that the proceedings were in the civil jurisdiction in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">It was said that contempt proceedings are sui generis , particularly where the proceedings were themselves taken within the original 1994 proceedings in which the undertaking had been given by Mr Seymour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Those proceedings arose out of the earlier 1982 disciplinary proceedings in which Mr Seymour had been found guilty of professional misconduct and struck off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Accordingly, it was argued that having regard to the fact that disciplinary proceedings both under the relevant legislation and in the exercise of the Supreme Court's inherent jurisdiction were not criminal proceedings but sui generis because the Court was called upon to examine the conduct of solicitors as explained by Mason J in Weaver v Law Society of New South Wales [1979] HCA 35 ; (1979) 142 CLR 201 at 207, that the contempt proceedings brought before Buddin J were of the same character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">31 Mr Seymour relied upon the statement that all proceedings for contempt ' must realistically be seen as criminal in nature ' as Deane J pointed out in Hinch v Attorney General (Vict) [1987] HCA 56 ; (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 49 and as approved by Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It was said that, accordingly, the tribunal's finding that the contempt charge determined by Buddin J was criminal was an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Next he argued that that error of law affected the tribunal's finding that Mr Seymour demonstrated a lack of candour and openness by his apparently contradictory stances taken before the Court of Appeal in the earlier contempt proceedings (namely that the Law Society should not be allowed to appeal against his acquittal) and his stance in the proceedings before the tribunal (that the proceedings before Buddin J were not criminal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">32 Mr Seymour also argued that contempt being within the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a superior court of record, a conviction for it was not a conviction ' of an offence under a law of ... a State ' within the meaning of s 312(1)(e) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">This was because in Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 a number of justices had held that the offence of contempt by scandalizing the court, which had been originally been triable on indictment, was not an ' ... offence against any law of the Commonwealth ' so as to require trial by jury pursuant to s 80 of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">This was because the source of the Family Court's power to deal with contempts was derived from Ch III of the Constitution , which was not, within the meaning of s 80 of the Constitution , ' a law of the Commonwealth '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">So, it was said, the source of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to punish for contempt, being inherent in its establishment as a superior court of record, the same reasoning applied to deny proceedings for contempt the character of resulting in a conviction of an offence under a law of the State of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">33 Mr Seymour also submitted that because a conviction for contempt could not become spent under Pt VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) within the meaning of s 290(2)(c) of the Act, that section manifested an intention to exclude from its purview convictions for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">34 The Authority submitted that the tribunal was correct to classify the proceedings before Buddin J as having involved a conviction of a criminal offence by reference to the character of the jurisdiction invoked under Pt 55 rr 7 and 13 of the Supreme Court Rules , the fact that the proceedings were to seek the punishment by imprisonment of Mr Seymour and the nature of the inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Authority submitted that the character of the contempt charged before Buddin J was that of disobedience, in the sense of a defiance of the authority of the Supreme Court and that there was a public injury occasioned by such defiance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It was said that, the purpose of the proceedings was to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, to advance the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, relying on that class of contempt as being within a class of criminal contempt as explained in Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR at 531.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">35 The Authority submitted that the reasoning in Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386, did not affect the construction of s 312(1)(e) despite the fact that this might mean that similar wording in that section would create different results were the contempt alleged one that had been determined in a court established under Ch III of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">This result was supported because it was said that a law of a State could include that State's common law and its statute law, including ss 22 and 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) and the fact that in Attorney General v Whitley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314 at 320A-D, to which Buddin J had referred, it appeared that the finding of guilt in effect of the charge of contempt was a conviction of the criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">SUBMISSIONS AS TO PCA HIGH RANGE OFFENCE 
 
36 Mr Seymour contended that because the Board was aware of the conviction, though not by any direct answer of his and had not raised his non-disclosure or false answer to the Board with Mr Seymour before registering him in 1994, it was not open to the tribunal to rely on that matter over ten years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">37 It was submitted that pursuant to the operative provisions of the Act as they were in 1993 and 1994 prior to the Board's approval of Mr Seymour's application, the secretary of the Board had to refer, if the PCA high level offence were relevant, that offence to the Board, pursuant to the then provisions of s 114T(1)(a) and (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">And that it was said that because the Board knew of the conviction through Mr Seymour's having consented to the Federal Police's check of his criminal record, it had taken that matter into account in registering him and it was not open to the tribunal on the review to revisit the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">38 The Authority argued that the review by the tribunal was a merits review on all grounds and that it was open to the tribunal to conclude that the failure of Mr Seymour to disclose his conviction in 1993 went to his fitness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Moreover, the tribunal noted that Mr Seymour had made a similar denial of previous convictions to Buddin J who had made an adverse finding in his judgment about that issue, again going to the question for the ultimate consideration of the Authority under s 290(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">SUBMISSIONS AS TO THE EFFECT OF THE INVALIDITY OF THE ORIGINAL DECISION 
 
39 Mr Seymour argued that because the original decision was invalid the tribunal either had no jurisdiction to embark upon a review, or that if I were minded to uphold the appeal to the Court I ought to remit the matter directly to the original decision-maker rather than the tribunal pursuant to s 44(4) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">He made a formal submission that Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307, 41 FLR 338, was wrong but acknowledged that I am bound to follow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The Authority submitted that the approach of the tribunal applying well known authority was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">SUBMISSIONS AS TO THE CORRECT AND PREFERABLE DECISION 
 
40 Mr Seymour submitted that the reasoning of the tribunal as set out in paragraph 37 and the first sentence of paragraph 38 of its reasons (see [29]) demonstrated that the tribunal had failed in its statutory task of assessing the subjective and objective circumstances of Mr Seymour's offending behaviour in the way explained by the High Court in A Solicitor v Law Society (NSW) [2004] HCA 1 ; (2004) 216 CLR 253 at 267-268 [19] - [22] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">That submission was based on characterizing the tribunal's reasoning that Mr Seymour's history of having been struck off as a solicitor in 1982, having given the undertaking to the Supreme Court that he would not in future act or purport to act as a solicitor in 1994 and his 2004 conviction and sentence for contempt were facts which ' alone would be sufficient to render [Mr Seymour] not a fit and proper person whether the contempt was criminal or civil ' (see [38] of the tribunal's reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">41 The Authority submitted that the tribunal had been referring in this passage of its reasoning to the earlier findings which it had set out recounting the nature of the proceedings leading up to Buddin J's decision and his Honour's findings in that decision, including matters that were set out in the decision but not necessarily referred to directly in the tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The Authority said that there was a number of freestanding findings by the tribunal each of which would justify its ultimate conclusion, first, the findings which I have just set out, secondly, the findings relating to Mr Seymour's change of position as to whether contempt was a criminal offence depending on whether he was before the Court of Appeal or the tribunal (see [26]-[31] of the tribunal's reasons [26] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Thus the Authority argued that even if the tribunal had been wrong to take account of the balance of material referred to in [38] of its reasons, having concluded that by reference to the matters in [37] alone, Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person, that was a finding of fact on the merits in respect of which there was no error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">42 Moreover, the Authority relied on what Allsop J had said in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [231] - [233] (Weinberg J agreeing at [155]) that even if a jurisdictional error had been established, that may not vitiate the decision if there were a separate and independent reason which supported it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Likewise, the Authority referred to the observations by McHugh J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at 184 [80] that discretionary relief for cases in which jurisdictional error had been established may be refused if the applicant had in fact suffered no injustice, for example, because the statutory law compelled a particular outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">43 Next the Authority submitted that Mr Seymour's argument was misconceived because it amounted to a collateral attack against his conviction which was impermissible ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 240-245; NSW Bar Association v Somosi (2001) 48 ATR 562 at 577 [80]-[81] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller and Giles JJA agreeing).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It was submitted that the tribunal had to accept the conviction and the essential facts, that is, the ingredients of the offences found by Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That being so, it was said that there was no need in [37] of the tribunal's reasons to engage in an evaluation process of the matters to which it there referred particularly as the Authority argued that [37] incorporated a reference to the earlier findings at [8]-[15] of the tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">WAS MR SEYMOUR CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENCE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 
44 This issue raises two principal questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">First, do the two different descriptions of the concept of ' conviction of a criminal offence ' in ss 290 and 312 of the Act have different meanings?</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Secondly, was Mr Seymour's conviction of contempt within either or both of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">
 
45 In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69] - [71] McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said:
 
 
 '[69] The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute (see Taylor v Public Service Board (NSW) [1976] HCA 36 ; (1976) 137 CLR 208 at 213 per Barwick CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The meaning of the provision must be determined "by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole" ( Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320, per Mason and Wilson JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">See also South West Water Authority v Rumble's [1985] AC 609 at 617, per Lord Scarman, "in the context of the legislation read as a whole".).</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos ((1955) 92 CLR 39), Dixon CJ pointed out that "the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed ( Toronto Suburban Railway Co v Toronto Corporation [1915] AC 590 at 597; Minister for Lands (NSW) v Jeremias [1917] HCA 41 ; (1917) 23 CLR 322 at 332; K &amp; S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48 ; (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 312, per Gibbs CJ; at 315, per Mason J; at 321, per Deane J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">
 
 
 
 
 
 [70] A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals ( Ross v The Queen [1979] HCA 29 ; (1979) 141 CLR 432 at 440, per Gibbs J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Where conflict appears to arise from the language of particular provisions, the conflict must be alleviated, so far as possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve that result which will best give effect to the purpose and language of those provisions while maintaining the unity of all the statutory provisions (see Australian Alliance Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Q) [1916] St R Qd 135 at 161, per Cooper CJ; Minister for Resources v Dover Fisheries Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 565 at 574, per Gummow J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court "to determine which is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, and which must give way to the other" ( Institute of Patent Agents v Lockwood [1894] AC 347 at 360, per Lord Herschell LC).</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">
 
 
 
 
 
 [71] Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision ( The Commonwealth v Baume [1905] HCA 11 ; (1905) 2 CLR 405 at 414, per Griffith CJ; at 419, per O'Connor J; Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigraiton Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 12-13,, per Mason CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">In The Commonwealth v Baume ((1905) [1905] HCA 11 ; 2 CLR 405 at 414) Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet ((1688) 1 Show KB 106 [89 ER 480]) to support the proposition that it was "a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">' 
 
 

46 Their Honours held (194 CLR at 384 [78]) that the duty of the court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">47 In ascertaining what meaning the differing expressions in ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) were taken by the Parliament to have, it is important to bear in mind that each section is concerned with the impact which a conviction may have upon the Authority's performance of its functions in relation to the registration of a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">First, s 290(2)(c) appears in the principal provision dealing with the function of registration, which is an annual event for every migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Secondly, s 312(1)(e) is relevant to the ongoing function of the Authority under s 303 pursuant to which it has a discretion to cancel or suspend the registration of a migration agent or to caution him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The occasion for the exercise of that discretion arises if the Authority is satisfied, inter alia, that:
 
 '303 ... 
 
 
 
 (f) the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance;' 
 
 
 

48 The evident purpose of s 312 is to cast an obligation on the migration agent to notify the Authority of the events there enumerated so that the Authority can consider whether to revisit, pursuant to s 303 and the scheme of natural justice in Part 3 of Division 3 of the Act, the question of registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Thus under s 312(1)(a) the migration agent's bankruptcy must be notified and s 303(e) makes bankruptcy a matter which enlivens the Authority's powers to cancel or suspend the migration agent's registration or to caution him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">And, s 290(2)(g) requires the Authority to take into account an applicant's bankruptcy at any time in considering whether to register him or her as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">49 Additionally, s 312(1) deals with events which occur after registration but which, had they occurred beforehand, would have been relevant for the Authority's consideration in deciding whether to register the person as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">However, it is important in construing these provisions to consider the fact that a contravention of s 312(1) is an offence of strict liability (s 312(2)), while s 290 creates no offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">50 The other relevant provisions of Division 3 of Part 3 of the Act and s 312, which is in Division 5 of Part 3, evince the intention of protecting the public by regulating who should be, and remain entitled to be, registered as migration agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Those provisions are also penal in nature (even though not each of them creates a criminal offence), particularly s 303, in the sense that they expose persons already registered as migration agents to a penalty for the reasons given in Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 esp at 146 [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The penal aspect is attached to these provisions for the purpose of better securing protection of the public from persons who ought not be registered as migration agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">51 By s 15AA(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) a purposive approach to the construction of the Act is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">That section provides:
 
 '(1) In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">' 
 

52 In Waugh v Kippen [1986] HCA 12 ; (1986) 160 CLR 156 at 164-165 Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ said (I have added in the following passage the interpolation in square brackets which McHugh J inserted when citing it in Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd [1997] HCA 53 ; (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 109 and see too per Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 102-103; Chew v The Queen [1992] HCA 18 ; (1992) 173 CLR 626 at 632):
 
 'The modern approach in construing penal statutes was stated by Gibbs J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">(as he then was) in Beckwith v. The Queen ((1976) [1976] HCA 55 ; 135 CLR 569 at 576) as follows: 
 
 
 
 "The rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences: see R. v. Adams ((1935) [1935] HCA 62 ; 53 CLR 563 at pp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">567-568); Craies on Statute Law , 7th ed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">(1971), pp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">529-534.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The rule is perhaps one of last resort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">" 
 
 
 
 In the course of argument, the question arose whether the two principles of interpretation to which we have referred [ie a purposive interpretation which furthered industrial safety and the rule that penal provisions should be strictly construed] come into conflict in the present case and if so, how the conflict is to be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">If such a conflict was to arise, the court must proceed with its primary task of extracting the intention of the legislature from the fair meaning of words by which it has expressed that intention, remembering that it is a remedial measure passed for the protection of the worker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It should not be construed so strictly as to deprive the worker of the protection which Parliament intended that he should have: Harrison v. National Coal Board ([1951] AC 639 at p. 650), per Lord Porter; John Summers &amp; Son Ltd. v. Frost ([1955] AC 740 at p. 751), per Viscount Simonds; McCarthy v. Coldair Ltd. ([1951] 2 TLR 1226 at pp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">1227-1228), per Denning L.J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In such a context the strict construction rule is indeed one of last resort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Furthermore, the process of construction must yield for all purposes a definitive statement of the incidence of an obligation imposed on the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The legislature cannot speak with a forked tongue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">' 
 

53 One substantive difference between s 290(2)(c) and s 312(1)(e) is that the former provides a relevant consideration to which the Authority must have regard and which, on its face, does not require the applicant for registration to do anything, while the latter imposes a positive obligation on a registered agent to bring an event to the notice of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">54 There are also textual differences between ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) which suggest that each may operate independently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">First, s 290(2)(c) has no geographic limitation and so, on a literal reading, can apply to convictions which occurred outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Indeed, a conviction in another country for some offence involving deliberate dishonesty could well bear on the question to which s 290(2)(c) requires the Authority to have regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Secondly, s 290(2)(c) classifies the convictions to which regard must be had to the classes of those relevant to either the fitness and propriety or the integrity of the applicant for registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Thirdly, s 312(1)(e) catches all convictions within the geographic area, regardless of whether they were for offences of the classes identified in s 290(2)(c) or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Thus, s 312(1)(e) would require notification of a conviction for jaywalking or for parking offences involving no question of character or integrity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">55 One reason why s 312(1)(e) may be framed as it is, is so that once notified the Authority is able to consider for itself whether the conviction enlivens or affects the exercise of its powers under s 303, which is a similar function as s 290(2)(c) creates, albeit in respect of convictions wherever made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">That is, under s 290(2)(c) the Authority would be unlikely to be capable of regarding as relevant to the question it poses that an applicant for registration had been convicted of jaywalking or parking offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Likewise, although a registered migration agent would have to disclose such a conviction under s 312(1)(f), it is equally unlikely that by having regard to it the Authority would be able to form the satisfaction required by s 303(f) to authorize it to take one of the steps in s 303(a)-(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">56 What s 312(1)(e) catches is a conviction '... of an offence under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">This wording is similar to but distinct from that in s 80 of the Constitution which deals with trials on indictment of '... any offence against any law of the Commonwealth' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">57 In Western Australia v The Commonwealth (the Native Title Act case) [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373 at 487 Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said:
 
 'A "law of the Commonwealth", as that term is used in the Constitution , cannot be the unwritten law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It is necessarily statute law, for the only power to make Commonwealth law is vested in the Parliament (Consitiution, s 1 ; see also Covering Clause 5 and ss 51 and 52 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">But the common law is not itself a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">' 
 

58 In Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 the Court considered whether the power of the Family Court to punish for contempt was derived from a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">By s 35 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth), the Family Court was declared to have the same power to punish for contempt as had the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">And s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provided that the High Court had the same power and authority to punish contempts as had the Supreme Court of Judicature in England at the commencement of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">59 Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 397 [25]) held that the term 'law of the Commonwealth' in s 80 of the Constitution refers to laws made under legislative powers of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They held that an obligation or liability which had its source in the Constitution itself did not arise under a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">They continued (200 CLR at 397 [25]):
 
 'The fact that there are laws made by the Parliament which are declaratory of the power implicit in Ch III of the Constitution or which make provision under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution incidental to the exercise of that power does not bring the case within s 80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">' 
 
 Hayne J agreed with Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 428 [108], 429 [113]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">

60 McHugh J disagreed saying that even though the content of the contempt power of the Family Court could only be ascertained by reference to the common law, its source was a law of the Commonwealth (200 CLR at 399 [36]-[37]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">He held that s 35 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) was that source (200 CLR at 403-405 [48]-[50] Kirby J agreed with McHugh J on this point (200 CLR at 416 [80]-[81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">It is clear that Callinan J also considered that s 35 created an offence against a law of the Commonwealth (200 CLR at 431-433 [121]-[126], 439 [136]; see too Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [13] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">61 Accordingly, the Court was evenly divided on the question as to whether contempt of a Ch III court was an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">However, Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 is not decisive of the question of construction of ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) of the Act in relation to a contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Rather, that case involved for Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ the application of the principle that the common law is not a law of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">62 I am of opinion that the common law is a law of each State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The reasoning underlying the decision in the Native Title Case [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373 at 487 was that the Constitution was the only source of the laws of the Commonwealth and it identified the Parliament as the mechanism by which such laws came into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">But the nature of the federation created by the Constitution recognized that a body of law, separate from statute, existed in the former colonies which became States on 1 January 1901.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">That body of law, the common law, undoubtedly exists today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">It forms part of the 'single system of jurisprudence constituted by the Constitution , federal, State and Territory laws and the common law of Australia' identified by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36 ; (2000) 203 CLR 503 at 534 [66] (see too Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 at 562).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">63 Although their Honours referred to the 'common law of Australia', that law derives its unity through the role of the High Court under s 73 of the Constitution which enables that Court to harmonize differences in the earlier common laws of the various States by establishing common principles (see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 at 29-30 per Brennan J; ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at 71 [38] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; Blunden v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 73 ; (2003) 218 CLR 330 at 349 [59] per Kirby J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Nonetheless, the source of that 'common law of Australia' in relation to the inherent power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to punish for contempt of court can only be the common law of that State, because, as the Native Title Case (1995) 183 CLR at 487 held, the Commonwealth itself has no such source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">64 The jurisdiction exercised by the Supreme Court in applying the common law, whether in a proceeding for contempt, or in an action for breach of contract or for the tort of negligence where no matter under Ch III of the Constitution arises, is an exercise of applying the law of the State to the adjudication of the proceeding or cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">65 A source of the jurisdiction and, thus, of the power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to punish for contempt is to be found in ss 22 and 23 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) which provide:
 
 '22 The Supreme Court of New South Wales as formerly established as the superior court of record in New South Wales is hereby continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 
 23 The Court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">' 
 

66 That court's rules included Part 55 which dealt with contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Division 3 of Part 55 created a procedure for a motion on notice to be filed seeking punishment for a contempt committed in connection with proceedings (SCR Pt 55 r 6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">A statement of charge had to be subscribed to or made part of the motion and it had to specify the contempt of which the contemnor is alleged to be guilty (SCR Pt 55 r 7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">67 Mr Seymour was proceeded against before Buddin J under Division 3 of Part 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">68 In Young v Registrar, Court of Appeal [No 3] (1993) 32 NSWLR 262 at 281D-282G Kirby P and at 288A-D Handley JA held that Pt 55 r 14 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), which contained a power to discharge a convicted contemnor from prison, was authorized by an Act, namely the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">They held that this was because, first, the rule had been made as delegated legislation under the Act and, secondly, in The Queen v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia [1956] HCA 10 ; (1956) 94 CLR 254 at 280 Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ had approved of the explanation given by Dixon J in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd and Meakes v Dignan [1931] HCA 34 ; (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 101-102 that a statute may authorize the Executive to make a law --- i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">to make delegated legislation --- and that such a law is made under the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">69 The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court of record so constituted, such as the Supreme Court of New South Wales, includes a power to punish for contempts out of court which are committed not just of that court but against any court over which the superior court exercises a supervisory jurisdiction: John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v McRae [1955] HCA 12 ; (1955) 93 CLR 351 at 364-365 per Dixon CJ, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Earlier their Honours said:
 
 'A party disobedient to the order or process of a court is often said to be "in contempt".</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">In these cases each court has its own appropriate means of enforcement, and such "contempts" are not criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Criminal contempt consists in contumelious behaviour to a court, and is divided into two broad classes--contempt in the face of the court and contempt out of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">All criminal contempts are indictable offences at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Contempts in the face of the court have, however, from time immemorial been punishable summarily (i.e.</sentence>

 (see too James v Robinson [1963] HCA 32 ; (1963) 109 CLR 593 at 612 per Windeyer J) 

70 The significance of their Honours' judgment is that in cases of 'criminal contempt' all such contempts are indictable misdemeanours at common law but are also capable of being punishable summarily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That result followed from the undelivered judgment of Wilmot J in R v Almon (1765) Wilm 243; 97 ER 94; see too: James v Robinson [1963] HCA 32 ; (1963) 109 CLR 593 at 600-602, 612.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">An indictable misdemeanour was triable as an ordinary criminal offence, on indictment before a jury (see Rex v Tibbits [1902] 1 KB 77 at 87).</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">It is a common law criminal offence which was once described by Lindley LJ as '... the only offence that I know of which is punishable at common law by summary process' ( O'Shea v O'Shea &amp; Parnell (1890) 15 PD 59 at 64, cited with approval in Australian Building and Construction and Builders' Labourers' Federation v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 48 at 52; 40 ALR 518 at 521.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">) And it must follow that where the misdemeanour is punished by summary process, it is no less a punishment that follows conviction for a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">71 Nowadays, all charges of contempt are invariably heard by a judge or a full court sitting on a summary trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The procedure for trial by jury of such a charge or indictment has fallen into desuetude ( Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1987) 7 NSWLR 588 at 595A-D per Street CJ, Hope, Glass, Samuels and Priestly JJA; In re Lonrho Plc [1990] 2 AC 154 at 177B-C; Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 at 393-394 [12] ; Borrie &amp; Lowe: The Law of Contempt (3 rd ed) p 469).</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In Attorney-General (NSW) v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (1985) 6 NSWLR 695 at 707C-E McHugh JA referred to Rex v Tibbits [1902] 1 KB 77 as the last reported case in England of a trial for contempt on indictment and he said there had not been such a trial in New South Wales in the twentieth century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">72 The current mode of proceeding for criminal contempt by the summary procedure is the product of historical development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Whatever procedure be employed to prosecute a charge of criminal contempt, in my opinion, cannot change the essential nature of that charge from being a criminal charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">As McHugh JA pointed out in Attorney-General (NSW) v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd (1985) 6 NSWLR 695 at 707E-708E, the overwhelming preference has been in recent times to use the summary procedure and its utilization need not be justified, unlike attempts in the past to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">As he said (6 NSWLR at 707E) '... the summary procedure is a departure from the ordinary course of law for criminal proceedings' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">But that procedure does not change the character or incidents of criminal contempt from being at common law a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Lord Russell of Killowen CJ explained the then state of the law in Reg v Gray [1900] 2 QB 36 at 40-41 saying that the summary jurisdiction was '... not a new-fangled jurisdiction; it is a jurisdiction as old as the common law itself, of which it forms part' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">But his Lordship pointed out at that time it was exercised '... only when the case is clear and beyond reasonable doubt' and where that feature were not present he said that the courts left it to the Attorney-General to decide whether to proceed by criminal information; i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">indictment: see R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The reporter noted in Reg v Gray [1900] 2 QB at 43 that the procedure then used was to issue an order on the Crown side of the Queen's Bench Division directing the accused to appear and show cause why he or she should not be committed for contempt as laid out in affidavits: see Onslow's and Whalley's Case ; (1873) LR 9 QB 219 at 219-220; see too Skipworth's Case (1873) LR 9 QB 230 at 232 per Blackburn J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">73 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 all justices considered the historical classification of contempts as 'civil' and 'criminal' to be unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the differences upon which the distinction of classification is based as being in many respects 'illusory' (183 CLR at 534) while McHugh J said the case for abolishing the distinction 'is a strong one' (183 CLR at 549).</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">74 Nonetheless, the distinction had been recognized in the High Court as recently as Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">75 The reliance on the distinction in a case like the present, where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended, for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred?</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Did it remain so or did it transmute, as the seriousness of, and contumaciousness of, his conduct was proved in evidence or found by Buddin J when giving judgment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleon-like character demonstrated, in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108-109 and in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525, that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The High Court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between 'civil' and 'criminal' contempt should be abolished (see 183 CLR at 549).</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">76 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534, Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that because of the illusory nature of the differences said to exist between the 'civil' and 'criminal' classes of contempt and the fact that the usual outcome of all such proceedings is punishment, all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">77 That does not result in all contempt proceedings themselves being now seen to be for a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Indeed, their Honours went on to say (183 CLR at 534):
 
 'However, to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">There are clear procedural differences, the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury, whereas charges of contempt do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">There is no basis, in our view, for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty, given in a jury trial, to be quashed on appeal, but did not permit of an order for retrial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Moreover, the issue, so far as contempt is concerned, is not whether there should be a retrial, but whether there should be a rehearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">' 
 

78 That reasoning reflected what the Court had said in Hinch v Attorney-General (Vict) (No 2) [1987] HCA 56 ; (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 89 where it noted:
 
 'Notwithstanding that a contempt may be described as a criminal offence, the proceedings do not attract the criminal jurisdiction of the court to which the application is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">On the contrary, they proceed in the civil jurisdiction and attract the rule that ordinarily applies in that jurisdiction, 
 namely, that costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">' 

79 The Full Court of this court has held in Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 48; 40 ALR 518 that the court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a verdict of acquittal on the merits on a charge of criminal contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">That case had applied an earlier decision of a Full Court in Thompson v Mastertouch TV Service Pty Ltd [No 3] (1978) 38 FLR 397; 19 ALR 547 which had held that the court under s 24(1)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a verdict of acquittal on the merits of a criminal charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">This line of authority was subsequently approved in Davern v Messel [1984] HCA 34 ; (1984) 155 CLR 21 (see esp at 46 per Mason and Brennan JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">As Bowen CJ, Evatt and Deane JJ pointed out in Australian Building Construction and Builders' Labourers' Federation v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 48 at 53; 40 ALR 518 at 522:
 
 'A finding of guilt of criminal contempt is a "conviction" (see Izuora v R [1953] AC 327 at 334-5) of an "offence" (see Shamadasani v King-Emperor [1945] AC at 264 at 270: "so grave an offence as contempt of court").</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">In Re James W Thompson (1893) 19 VLR 286, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Williams, Holroyd and Hood JJ) held that an appeal against an order attaching the appellant for contempt of court in publishing certain articles in a newspaper commenting on pending proceedings was incompetent for the reason that the proceedings for attachment were "a criminal matter, and therefore there is no appeal to this court".</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Their Honours commented that the purported appeal was "virtually an appeal from a punishment inflicted by a judge presiding in the criminal court for a criminal offence" (see, also, the equally strong comments of Cussen J in Re Dunn [1906] VLR 493 at 501-2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Acquittal of a charge of criminal contempt after a hearing on the merits is, in our view, an acquittal in criminal proceedings for the purposes of the established principle that no appeal lies from an acquittal on the merits of a criminal charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">' 
 

80 And in Shamadasani v King-Emperor [1945] AC 264 at 270 (in a passage approved by the Court in Hinch v Attorney-General (Vict) (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">2) [1987] HCA 56 ; (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 90), Lord Goddard also said, in explaining why the Privy Council ordered the Crown to pay costs contrary to the usual practice in criminal cases where the Crown appeared to uphold a conviction:
 
 'Although this matter is one which is known as criminal contempt it obviously is in a different category from an ordinary criminal case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">' 
 

81 In Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) [1999] HCA 19 ; (1999) 198 CLR 435 at 453 [58] Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ observed that a contempt proceeding which was criminal in nature was not a criminal prosecution, and so ordered costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">82 Relevantly for present purposes in Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 497-498 Windeyer J in obiter dicta (Owen J agreeing on this aspect at 112 CLR at 516) said:
 
 'In Scott v. Scott ([1913] AC 417) Lord Atkinson, after referring to several cases, said: "It was contended that these cases show that the disobedience of an order of Court constitutes in itself a crime, a criminal contempt of Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Unfortunately for this contention, however, they do something more than that; they show I think, conclusively, that if a person be expressly enjoined by injunction, a most solemn and authoritative form of order, from doing a particular thing, and he deliberately in breach of that injunction, does that thing, he is not guilty of any crime whatever, but only of a civil contempt of Court" ([1913] AC at p 456).</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">And in New South Wales, more than sixty years ago Walker J. spoke of "the mistaken view that all the offences generically known as contempts stand on the same footing, and that all contempts are criminal and must be dealt with as though they were the subject of a criminal indictment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">"This", he said, "is not so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">" Dealing with an application for the sequestration of the property of a trade union that had disobeyed an injunction he said, "This is not an application by the plaintiff that the Court should exercise its criminal jurisdiction, and punish the union for a criminal offence; it is a step in the suit by which the plaintiff endeavours, by the only means open to him, to enforce against the union the injunction of the Court": Keogh v. The Australian Workers' Union ((1902) 2 SR Eq (NSW) 265 at pp 281, 282).</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">' 
 

83 Subsequently in Doyle v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 46 ; (1985) 156 CLR 510 at 516, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ applied Windeyer J's remarks saying that:
 
 '... disobedience of an injunction is not a criminal offence ... and a proceeding for the committal of a person who has wilfully disobeyed an order of the Court is not a criminal proceeding (see La Trobe University v Robinson and Pole [1973] VR 682 at 688) except possibly where the proceedings are grounded upon a contumacious or defiant contempt of the Court....' 
 

84 The elusiveness of the distinction Windeyer J identified is demonstrated by the result in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">There the question was what standard of proof applied, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">civil or criminal, in proceedings which fell squarely within Lord Atkinson's 'civil' classification, namely, charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached (what was then termed) a Mareva injunction, (this is now known as a Mareva order: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 393-394 [25] [-26]) by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (183 CLR at 533-534):
 
 'Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given, also, that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking, it is necessary to acknowledge, as it was in Mudginberri ((1986) [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108), that punitive and remedial objects are, in the words of Salmon LJ "inextricably intermixed" ( Jennison v Baker [1972] 2 QB 52 at 64).</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">
 
 Moreover and, perhaps, of more importance, nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as " punitive " and others as " remedial or coercive ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Punishment is punishment, whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines, the usual sanctions for contempt, constitute punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company's failure to comply with an order or undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">' 
 

85 More recently in Rich v ASIC [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at 145 [32] , [33], 148 [41], six justices referred to the difficulties in attempting to classify all proceedings as either civil or criminal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">They noted the elusive distinction between 'punitive and 'protective' proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">And in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 112-113, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said that lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">They held that a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or undertaking would constitute such wilful disobedience unless it were casual, accidental or unintentional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">They said (161 CLR at 113) that such a deliberate commission or omission:
 
 '... went beyond a matter of mere civil contempt there opening up ... a jurisdiction in the Federal Court to adopt such measures in its discretion, whether punitive or coercive, which would best deal with the contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">' 
 

86 They said of that jurisdiction (161 CLR at 115):
 
 'Contempt of Court is a distinctive offence attracting remedies which are sui generis : Morris v Crown Office [1970] 2 QB 114 at 129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">' 
 

87 Although Mr Seymour argued that the Supreme Court's disciplinary jurisdiction over solicitors was sui generis , as Mason J had said in Weaver v Law Society of New South Wales [1979] HCA 35 ; (1979) 142 CLR 201 at 207), I do not consider that to be relevant here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The charge of contempt related to disobedience of an order of that Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The judicial source of the order, even if, sui generis , is not of any significance to the charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The charge related to the conduct of Mr Seymour in contravening an order of the Court which was valid and binding on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">And while it may be that the offence of contempt of court attracts remedies which are also sui generis , the uniqueness of the remedies is not decisive of the question whether contempt is properly to be characterized as a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">88 The tribunal referred (at [16]) to Buddin J's reference ([2004] NSWSC 493 [12] to Attorney-General (NSW) v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314 at 320B-C where Clarke, Meagher and Handley JJA said that a conviction for contempt was a conviction for an offence which is criminal in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">However, the Court of Appeal was dealing with a case in which the contempts alleged were, if proved, 'criminal' on any view because they amounted to interferences in the course of justice by improperly attempting to influence a judicial officer hearing a matter and bringing improper pressure to bear on a party to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">89 The Court of Appeal there held (31 NSWLR at 321C-D) that the provisions of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) applied to a conviction for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Mr Seymour argued that such a conviction cannot become spent under Pt VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) within the meaning of s 290(2)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">However, the conviction is either of a criminal offence or it is not, whatever the provisions of Pt VIIC may provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">90 Under s 85ZM(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a conviction for an offence is spent at the end of 10 years after conviction if a person is not sentenced to imprisonment at all or if the sentence is for less than 30 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In s 85ZL 'State law' is defined as meaning '... a law in force in a State (other than a Commonwealth law)' and 'State offence' as meaning '... an offence against a State law'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">In contrast, in s 85ZL , 'Commonwealth law' is defined by reference to an Act, an instrument or other legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">I am of opinion that the definition of 'State law' is intended to include the unwritten law of the States and Territories as well as written laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">91 It follows that convictions for contempt under State law can become spent under s 85ZM and so this argument has no substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">92 As the above review demonstrates, it is no mean feat to ascertain whether what Mr Seymour was found guilty of was a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The task is as exacting and uninformative as seeking to find the answer to the old enquiry as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">93 In Attorney-General v Newspaper Publishing Plc [1988] Ch 333 at 377, Lloyd LJ tellingly observed that it was nonsensical for the law to classify as a criminal a stranger to the litigation who aided and abetted a party bound by an injunction to breach the injunction, while leaving the principal not as a criminal at all but as only 'guilty' of 'civil' contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">He would have classified each as 'civil'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">In contrast, Sir John Donaldson MR also found the classification between civil and criminal contempt no longer to be appropriate and suggested an, apparently criminal classification ([1988] Ch at 362B-D; see too: Borrie &amp; Lowe : The Law of Contempt (3 rd ed) pp 630-664).</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Of course, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ had debunked the example of the stranger being liable on a different standard as 'an absurd proposition' in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">94 For my part, were I free to do so, I would regard all contempts which interfere with the course of justice or the due administration of the law ( Lane v Registrar of Supreme Court of NSW [1981] HCA 35 ; (1981) 148 CLR 245 at 257-258; Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 107) as criminal offences because they denote a qualification or impediment on (e.g.</sentence>

<sentence id="s348">When the Court enjoins a person from acting in a particular way, it is undoubtedly saying that it will be a breach of the law so to act thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Why, when the person breaches the injunction is his or her behaviour any less serious or different in character than a breach of a statutory prohibition to which criminal sanctions also attach?</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">95 When the Court quells a controversy by ordering that a party do or refrain from a particular act or activity, it defines the rights and obligations of the parties as an aspect of the way in which our society is governed (cf: D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 755 at 761-762 [31] - [36] , 763 [43] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">A breach of such an order interferes in the administration of the law because it evinces an intention not to obey the law, as it affects the parties, which has been determined by the Court as a branch of government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">That is so whether the injunction is final or interlocutory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">96 Of course, an order for the payment of money as damages or compensation is of a different character.</sentence>

<sentence id="s356">Injunctions, however, ought always be framed so that it is possible for the party enjoined to obey their commands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">97 And a failure to obey the injunction does interfere with the administration of the law because it evinces an intention that the command by the Court can be ignored.</sentence>

<sentence id="s370">But where the liberty of the subject may be in jeopardy as part of the range of sentencing or remedial options open to a court on a finding that a charge of contempt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, I am firmly of opinion that such a proceeding is a criminal proceeding whether or not a sentence imprisonment ultimately be imposed (cp: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 49 ; (2003) 216 CLR 161 at 204-207 [131] - [139] per Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreeing at 166 [1], [3]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">102 A person charged with contempt should never be exposed to the duplicitous, almost schizophrenic, nature of a charge of 'civil' contempt which, during the course of the hearing may change into a 'criminal' charge.</sentence>

<sentence id="s373">It is unfair to the point of being unjust that a person defending proceedings does not know at the outset of the hearing the full nature of the case against him or her where liberty may be in jeopardy (cf: Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108-109).</sentence>

104 Accordingly, I must decide whether Mr Seymour was found by Buddin J to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">A 'civil' contempt can become 'criminal' where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order ( Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 541 per McHugh J citing Warrington J's well known dictum in Stancomb v Trowbridge Urban Council [1910] 2 Ch 190 at 194).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">A breach of an injunction or undertaking to the Court can also be criminal if it is '... an obstinate disregard' of the obligation imposed by or owed to the Court ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 111-112).</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The hallmark of a classification of 'criminal' contempt of this nature is contumacy or defiance ( Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 489 per Barwick CJ, 501-502 per Windeyer J; Doyle v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 46 ; (1986) 156 CLR 510 at 516).</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">105 Buddin J found that the facts revealed '... a matter of considerable objective gravity' ([2004] NSWSC 493 [7].</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">In imposing sentence he said ([2004] NSWSC 493 at [24]:
 
 'This is a case of clear disobedience of a court order by a man of considerable maturity who well appreciated the consequences of his actions, and who was nonetheless prepared to take the risk that he could so conduct himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">' 
 

106 Buddin J also found that the disobedience had occurred in the context of the dismissal of an appeal against Barr J's dismissal of three earlier charges of contempt against Mr Seymour for breaching the same injunction about 1 year before ([2004] NSWSC 493 [4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">And his Honour held that it was apparent to Mr Seymour from an early stage in the dealings the subject of his conviction that he was understood to be a solicitor by those in the office of the solicitors for the vendor of property dealing with him, yet he did nothing to disabuse them of their error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">107 I am of opinion that the conviction by Buddin J was for a 'criminal' contempt consisting of contumacious or defiant disobedience by Mr Seymour of the injunction not to act as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">I draw from his Honour's findings of fact that Mr Seymour knew exactly what he was doing in letting others with whom he was dealing think was a solicitor and he knew this was in flagrant disregard of the restraint which the court had imposed by the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">This conduct was not merely casual, unintentional or accidental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">There was a deliberate intention to disobey the injunction which was contumacious in the sense used in characterizing 'criminal' contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">108 It follows that Mr Seymour was convicted of a criminal offence by Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">109 And, Mr Seymour recognized his guilt at an early stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">As soon as he was confronted with the allegation, he acknowledged his wrongdoing (see per Buddin J at [2004] NSWSC 493 at [1] , [16]-[19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">I am of opinion that this ready acknowledgment carried with it the realization by Mr Seymour that the offence clearly had been committed by his deliberate and contumacious defiance of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Thus, when he was charged he was aware of all of the material facts and, despite the legal difficulties referred to above, must be taken to have been aware that he had been charged on 24 November 2003 ([2004] NSWSC 493 at [18]); with a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">110 Certainly he knew of the importance to the Authority of the charge listed before the Supreme Court on 31 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">He made submissions to Buddin J that a conviction might affect the Authority's view as to his fitness, propriety or integrity for the purposes of ss 290 and 303 of the Act as a matter for his Honour to take into account on sentence ([2004] NSWSC 493 at [14]-[15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">111 It follows that Mr Seymour falsely declared to the Authority in his application letter of 1 May 2004 that 'I am not currently the subject of any criminal proceedings'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">112 That brings me back to the question as to whether the conviction for contempt was a conviction of a criminal offence within the meaning of each of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">WHETHER THE CONVICTION FOR CONTEMPT WAS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT 
 
113 For the reasons given above, I am of opinion that the conviction being, as I have held, of 'criminal' contempt was a conviction '... of a criminal offence' within the meaning of s 290(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The conviction was relevant to each aspect to which s 290(2)(c) relates --- viz: Mr Seymour's fitness and propriety or his integrity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">A person who deliberately contravenes a court order not to act as a solicitor in circumstances as found by Buddin J is capable of being found both not to be a fit and proper person to give migration assistance and not to be a person of integrity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">114 I am also of opinion that s 312(1)(e) required Mr Seymour to notify the Authority of his conviction of the offence of contempt which is an offence under the law of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">For the reasons above, I am of that opinion whether the contempt power was inherent in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and so was part of that State's unwritten law, or was created under the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) or SCR Part 55 rr 7, 13 (see Young v Registrar Court of Appeal [No 3] (1993) 32 NSWLR 262 at 281D-282G, 288A-D).</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">115 Accordingly, the tribunal committed no error of law in finding that Mr Seymour had been convicted of a criminal offence by Buddin J and that he had not declared that he was the subject of a criminal proceeding in his 1 May 2004 application to the Authority when he ought to have declared that he was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">It was also correct to have decided that Mr Seymour failed to notify the Authority in accordance with s 312(1)(e) after his conviction by Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">PCA HIGH RANGE OFFENCE 
 
116 It was open to the tribunal in coming to a view as to whether or not Mr Seymour was a person of integrity or was a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance to consider his conduct in making the original application in 1993 for registration as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">The tribunal found, correctly, that there was no question at that time that the PCA high range offence conviction had not been spent by reason of the Criminal Records Act 1991 (NSW) ss 7 and 9 (see [34]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">117 On a review, the tribunal may exercise all the powers the discretions conferred on the person who could make the original decision pursuant to s 43(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Formation of the opinion required by s 290(2)(c) could relevantly be affected by the tribunal's perception of Mr Seymour's conduct in making his original application to the predecessor of the Authority, the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">118 A person who knows that he has been convicted of an offence, such as the high range PCA offence committed by Mr Seymour, and is asked whether he or she has any previous convictions, can fail to disclose the defence for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">There may be some genuine lapse of memory, for example, but the person in the position of the original Board or now the Authority, who receives an answer that there have been no previous convictions of the person, when that is incorrect, can take the view, after affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard, that the failure to answer candidly reflects on either or both of that person's integrity or their fitness and propriety to give immigration assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Under the now repealed ss 291 and 292(1)(a) (which were in force in 1993) Mr Seymour's application for registration had to be referred to the Board itself for its consideration because he had been convicted of the high range PCA offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">119 A person's candour about his or her faults or misdeeds in circumstances in which direct questions are asked that, if honestly answered, would reveal those past events, may be critical to the formation of the opinion required under s 290(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">In the case of a legal practitioner, a failure to disclose a previous conviction for dishonesty, can have very serious consequences upon the person's entitlement to retain the right and privilege of admission to practice in the profession once it is later found that there had been such a failure: In Re Davis [1947] HCA 53 ; (1947) 75 CLR 409.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">As Dixon J there said (75 CLR at 426) albeit in the context of the more serious crime of housebreaking for the purpose of theft, a prerequisite for admission to the legal profession would be a complete realization by the applicant of his or her obligation of candour to the Court in which he or she desired to serve as an agent of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">His Honour continued:
 
 'The fulfilment of that obligation of candour with its attendant risks proved too painful for the appellant, and when he applied to the Board for his certificate he withheld the fact that he had been convicted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">
 
 In those circumstances the conclusion that he is not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Bar is confirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">' 
 

120 Obviously each case involves the need for the relevant decision-maker to pay close attention to the conditions laid down in the relevant legislation and to have regard to the circumstances in which the failure to disclose occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">121 I am of opinion that it was open to the tribunal to have regard to the false answer which Mr Seymour had given in his original application to the Board lodged on 8 February 1993 in which he denied ever having been convicted even though he had been the subject of a criminal conviction a little over 2 years beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Mr Seymour's answer to the accusation of having failed to disclose the high range PCA offence in the initial application for registration was that he had consented to the Board making enquiries of the Police for a criminal records check which would have revealed the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">122 As is implicit in the tribunal's finding, it was not satisfied that that was a sufficient explanation for the failure to disclose in the first place (cf: Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 592).</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">There was no error of law in the tribunal's approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">EFFECT OF INVALIDITY OF THE ORIGINAL DECISION 
 
123 Ordinarily, where the legislature has given a party aggrieved by an administrative decision a full statutory right of appeal on facts and law, that is indicative of a legislative intention that that right is the party's only means of redress against the failure of the original decision-maker to follow, according to law, the rules of procedural fairness in coming to the decision: The Queen v Marks; Ex parte Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers' Federation [1981] HCA 33 ; (1981) 147 CLR 471 at 484 per Mason J, with whom Murphy J at 489, Aickin J at 493 and Wilson J at 494 agreed on this point; Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 113-117, esp at 117; Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 354 [31] - [32] (and see too at 353 [29] where Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307, 41 FLR 338; was followed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">124 On the administrative 'appeal', the reviewing body, be it the tribunal, or some other body, is in the position of exercising afresh the powers of the original decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">125 In Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307 at 314-316, Bowen CJ and Smithers J at 337 (Deane J dissenting at 344) held that s 25 of the AAT Act allowed the tribunal to review a 'decision' where the person who purported to make the decision had no power to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Both Bowen CJ and Smithers J pointed out that a construction of s 25 of the AAT Act which required the decision the subject of an application before the tribunal for review to be legally valid and effective would create practical problems and inconvenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">And as Hely, Gyles and Allsop JJ held in Minister for Immigration v Ahmed [2005] FCAFC 58 ; (2005) 143 FCR 314 at 322 [33] it is clear that, unless a statute provides otherwise, the tribunal can review a decision which was not authorized by law or by statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">126 Here, on 14 February 2005 the Authority wrote to Mr Seymour notifying him that '... the Authority has made the decision to refuse your application for registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">At that time, no one was aware that there had been no formal delegation to the actual decision-maker to make that 'decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Mr Seymour immediately applied on 17 February 2005 to the tribunal to review the 'decision' and on 14 April 2005 the tribunal granted a stay of the 'decision' which had the effect of permitting Mr Seymour to continue to act as a migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">127 Only a court can decide authoritatively whether or not an administrative decision was legally valid or effective: Plantiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 505-506 [75] - [76] , 513-514 [104]; cf Minister for Immigration v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 605 [13] per Gleeson CJ, 614-615 [51] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ, 618 [63] per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">128 One reason why prerogative relief or constitutional writs issue when a decision is found to have been affected by jurisdictional error, even though it is 'regarded in law, as no decision at all' ( Plaintiff S157/2001 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] ) is to provide an authoritative and legally binding judicial determination which recognizes that the decision has no legal effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Of course, it could be said that any such relief or writ is unnecessary because the presence of the jurisdictional error entails the result that there is nothing to quash or upon which to prohibit further proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">But the availability of these remedies enables the Court to perform its function of quelling controversies and authoritatively determining that the decision cannot be given effect thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">129 Now when a person such as Mr Seymour, is confronted with a decision which affects him or her or it, two possible avenues of legal challenge are available: one involving the executive power of the Commonwealth through a review in the tribunal under the AAT Act, the other involving the judicial power through proceedings under s 75(v) of the Constitution or s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) or the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">130 It would produce great uncertainty if the result of the majority decision in Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307; 41 FLR 338, which has stood for over 27 years, were now to be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">An example of a consequence of ignoring the settled course of authority in this Court suffices to show the unlikelihood that the Parliament intended such a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">If the original decision were found by the tribunal to have been made by a person without authority to make it or to have been infected by jurisdictional error, and the tribunal then made a decision using its powers under s 43(1) of the AAT Act to stand in the stead of the original decision-maker, the original decision-maker could set the tribunal's decision at nought by making a new decision on the basis that, notwithstanding that the tribunal had a full hearing on the merits, its decision was no decision at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Rather than providing the subject with an effectual means of redress against the use of the executive power, the AAT Act would be turned into an instrument of uncertainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">Such a result cannot have been intended by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Rather, I am of opinion that the intention of the Parliament in enacting the AAT Act was to enable the tribunal to review decisions which were affected by jurisdictional error as well as ones where there was some, even unknown, defect in the decision-maker's capacity to make the decision in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">131 Even though Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 was decided on different legislation, I am of opinion that Mason J (136 CLR at 116) enunciated the approach which is appropriate to apply to a case like the present when he said:
 
 'But if the right of appeal is exercised and the appellate authority acts fairly and does not depart from natural justice the appeal may then be said to have "cured" a defect in natural justice or fairness which occurred at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Certainly this view has been taken in a number of cases--notably by the Privy Council in De Verteuil v. Knaggs ([1918] AC 557); Pillai v. Singapore City Council ([1968] 1 WLR 1278 at p 1286) and by the Supreme Court of Canada in Re Clark and Ontario Securities Commission ((1966) 56 DLR 92d) 585) and King v. University of Saskatchewan ((1969) 6 DLR (3d) 120); cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Denton v. Auckland City ([1969] NZLR 256) and Leary v. National Union of Vehicle Builders ([1971] Ch 34) where the contrary view was taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">In this conflict of authority my preference is for the approach taken by the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of Canada: first, because the party affected has elected to treat the administrative decision as a valid, though erroneous decision, by appealing from it, in preference to asserting his right to a proper performance by the authority of its duty at first instance; and secondly, because in some cases the court will be compelled to take account of the public interest in the efficiency of the administrative process and the necessity for reasonably prompt despatch of public business and balance that interest against the countervailing interest of the individual in securing a fair hearing--in appropriate cases that balance will be achieved if the individual secures a fair hearing on his appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">' 
 

132 By applying for a review in the tribunal, Mr Seymour elected to treat the original decision of the Authority as valid and, having proceeded with the full review, he has lost any right he had to challenge the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">He should not be allowed to have the opportunity to approbate a favourable review or reprobate an unfavourable result as he chooses (see too: Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) [1993] HCA 27 ; (1993) 182 CLR 26 at 41-42 per Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Meyers v Casey [1913] HCA 50 ; (1913) 17 CLR 90 at 99 per Barton ACJ, at 116 per Isaacs J (with whom Rich J agreed at 148)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">THE CORRECT AND PREFERABLE DECISION 
 
133 The reasons for administrative decisions are not to be pharsed and analysed as if they are judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Their role is to explain in the decision-maker's own words why he or she or they arrived at the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Administrative decision-makers are not necessarily or, I apprehend, usually trained lawyers with a keen eye to what court might find revelatory of an error of law (cf: Immer (No 145) Pty Ltd v Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) [1993] HCA 27 ; 182 CLR 26 at 41-42 per Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Meyers v Casey [1913] HCA 50 ; (1913) 17 CLR 90 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The court cannot acquire jurisdiction to review a decision if the tribunal merely makes an error of fact ( Waterford v The Commonwealth ((1987) [1987] HCA 25 ; 163 CLR 54 at 66 per Mason and Wilson JJ, 77 per Brennan J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">134 Here, the tribunal had the benefit of the judgment of Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">That revealed not only matters which went to the issues under s 290(2)(c) but also to those under ss 290(2)(h), namely any other matter relevant to Mr Seymour's fitness to give immigration assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">It would be open to the tribunal to rely, as it did in [37]-[38] on the objective facts of Buddin J's decision and sentence irrespective of the technical, legal issue which it addressed, and I have also considered, as to whether the contempt was a 'criminal offence' for the purposes of either or both of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Even if the contempt was not a criminal offence, I am of opinion that the tribunal did not err in having regard to the findings and conclusions of Buddin J in his judgment (cf: Minister for Immigration v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 244-245 [42] - [48] per Branson, Lindgren and Emmett JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">135 And, the tribunal's reasons show that it did examine 'the whole position': A Solicitor v Law Society (NSW) [2004] HCA 1 ; (2004) 216 CLR 253 at 266 [18] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Despite Mr Seymour's submissions, I am not satisfied that the tribunal made any error of law in approaching its task of making an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances before it concerning him and in making its decision as to its satisfaction under s 290(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The tribunal considered the detailed subjective and objective circumstances of Mr Seymour's offending behaviour (cf: 216 CLR at 268 [22]) in the context of the whole of its reasons, before expressing its conclusion at [37]-[38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The tribunal is not obliged to set out every detail of its reasoning process ( Re Ruddock; Ex parte S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 449 [54] per Gummow and Heydon JJ, Gleeson CJ agreeing at 438 [1] applying Commissioner for Australilan Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 592.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">There Northrop, Miles and French JJ held that a decision-maker could rely on an obvious and natural evaluation of admitted facts to decide that an applicant was not a fit and proper person).</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">136 Of course, the tribunal's 'satisfaction' as to Mr Seymour is not unexaminable, but its decision as to that matter is of a subjective nature: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 275-277 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">And, in exercising its functions, the tribunal stood in the Authority's shoes and, pursuant to s 43(1) of the AAT Act that included the requirements in considering Mr Seymour's application, to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case free from technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence (see s 311 of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Here, the question was the tribunal's personal satisfaction and it was free to attribute such weight to factors as it saw fit (185 CLR at 281).</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">137 I am of opinion, having regard to the reasons it gave, that when the tribunal made its evaluation of Mr Seymour at [37]-[38] it did so on a separate and independent basis from the vexed question of whether the contempt was a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">That is clear because the tribunal at [38] put the question of the nature of the contempt to one side and referred to the objective facts before Buddin J and the seriousness which his Honour attached to the conduct of Mr Seymour as reflected in the substantial sentence imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">There is no error of law in what the tribunal did in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">138 It was for the tribunal to form its own state of satisfaction under s 290(1) as to the fitness and propriety or integrity of Mr Seymour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">In doing so, it took into account matters under s 290(2)(c) and (h) independently of one another; that is, first, it considered that the contempt was a criminal offence thus enlivening ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) but secondly, and separately, it considered the objective facts revealed by the judgment of Buddin J, thus acting under s 290(2)(h).</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">139 In the second of these approaches to forming an opinion under s 290(1) the tribunal was entitled to have regard to, and form its own view as to, Mr Seymour's behaviour, as revelatory of the issue under s 290(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">It considered how he submitted, as it suited his own apparent self interest, in the Court of Appeal that contempt of the injunction was a criminal offence --- thus having the benefit of the principle that there is no appeal against an acquittal --- and in the tribunal, that it was not a criminal offence --- and so avoiding ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Of course, each of those stances may have been legally open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">But it was for the tribunal to be satisfied that a person who could adopt such flexibility about the very serious matter affecting him in the different contexts of the Court of Appeal and the tribunal, where different and opposite characterizations suited his purpose, was a person of integrity or was fit and proper within the meaning of s 290(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">140 There is no error of law in the evaluative process which the tribunal took.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">It had regard to both the unmeritorious and the meritorious factors under s 290.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">It referred to the fact that Mr Seymour's contemporaries regarded him as a person having real moral worth but it weighed that against his history of being struck off as a solicitor, the lack of explanation for and the fact of the consent injunction in 1994 and the conviction and sentence by Buddin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">141 It was open to the tribunal to have regard to Mr Seymour not explaining why he consented to injunctions 12 years after his striking off that he would not act as a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Again, it was open to the tribunal to see this lack of explanation, in combination with the other matters it took into account in [37]-[38] as revelatory of integrity and of fitness and propriety, just as in In Re Davis (1947) 75 CLR 407; and see too A Solicitor v Law Society (NSW) [2004] HCA 1 ; (2004) 216 CLR 253 at 267-268 [20] - [21] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Moreover, the underlying facts of the 1994 injunction were relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The tribunal had earlier found ([13]) that Mr Seymour was vague when asked to recount them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">142 I can see no error of law (and a good deal of common sense) in the clear inference drawn by the tribunal that Mr Seymour had purported to act as a solicitor before Blanch J made his order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Mr Seymour had knowledge of the facts and he cannot complain that having failed fully and clearly to provide them to the tribunal, it drew inferences against him: cp: Blatch v Archer (1774) 1 Cowp 63 [98 ER 969]; R v Burdett (1820) 4 B &amp; Ald 95 [106 ER 873]; Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 225 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, 233 per Brennan and Toohey JJ; Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25 ; (2001) 205 CLR 50 at 74-75 [65] - [67] per Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; see too Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418E-G per Handley JA; Temora Shire Council v Stein (2004) 134 LGERA 407 at 424 [52] per Giles JA, [56] per Hodgson JA, 425 [62] per Pearlman AJA; see too Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121 at 142-143 [51] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">143 I am satisfied that in [38] the tribunal was expressing an independent and freestanding reason for being satisfied, pursuant to s 290(1), that Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person regardless of the proper characterization of whether his contempt was a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Since there is no error of law in the way in which the tribunal arrived at this conclusion, even if it and I be wrong as to the nature of the contempt, the tribunal's decision should stand: SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at 184 [80] per McHugh J, 212 [211] per Hayne J with whom Kirby J agreed at 203 [174]; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [231] - [233] per Allsop J, Weinberg agreeing at [155].</sentence>
