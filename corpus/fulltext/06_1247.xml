 1 The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') in which the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to cancel a Global Special Humanitarian (Class BA) Visa which had been granted to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 At the commencement of the hearing an application was made by Counsel for the applicant for the publication of his name to be suppressed on the ground that, if the authorities in a particular country became aware of his circumstances, his safety and that of his family would be in jeopardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Counsel for the Minister did not oppose the application and I granted it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The same concerns render it necessary for me to outline the relevant background facts in somewhat less detail than would customarily occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These facts are not in contention and the outcome of the case, as will become apparent, does not turn on any of those facts which relate to the merits of the applicant's visa claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The applicant applied for a visa to enter Australia at an Australian Embassy in a European city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant gave a false name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He nominated a false country of citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The application was supported by a series of false claims and by some false documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The visa was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant came to Australia in 2002 and, in the following year, married an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">His wife has two children from a previous relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 Shortly after the applicant's arrival in Australia the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Department') became aware of information which cast doubt on the various claims made in support of the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Investigations were commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Following those investigations, in May 2003, the applicant was interviewed by departmental officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He continued to claim that the information which he had provided was accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Following the interview he was given a Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The notice was given pursuant to s 109 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant was advised that cancellation of his visa was in contemplation because he might not have complied with ss 101 , 102 and 103 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He was given the opportunity to comment on the allegations that he had failed to comply with ss 101 , 102 , 103 and 105 of the Act and to make submissions as to why his visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant responded, again asserting that the information that he had provided was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He maintained this position until 30 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 14 November 2003 a delegate of the Minister decided to cancel the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She did so because she considered that the applicant had made false claims relating to his citizenship and other matters in support of the original visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">On 30 December 2003 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">That application was made in his true name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">5 It is the subsequent procedural history of the application before the Tribunal which gives rise to the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The application remained undetermined on 25 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On that day the Tribunal received a lengthy letter containing submissions from solicitors acting for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The letter had attached to it various supporting documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The submissions contained an admission that the applicant had used a false name and provided other false information and documentation in support of his visa application and on subsequent occasions when he was asked by Departmental authorities to provide information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 On 3 February 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant inviting him to 'a face to face hearing' to be held on 25 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Under cover of a letter dated 15 February 2005 the applicant's solicitors returned a 'Request for Hearing' form to the Tribunal confirming that the applicant proposed to appear before the Tribunal and requesting that the Tribunal take oral evidence from his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">At some time between 15 and 24 February 2005 the Tribunal vacated the hearing date which had been scheduled for 25 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I was told from the Bar table that this vacating had been effected by a telephone communication from the Tribunal to the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">7 On 28 February 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant seeking further information relating to his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The applicant was told that the information was sought pursuant to s 359(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The details sought included the applicant's date and place of birth, addresses outside Australia where he had lived during the past 15 years, a description of how he left his home country and travelled to the country in which he made the visa application, his parents' personal details and a statement indicating why he contended that the visa would have been granted had he supplied the correct information in support of his original application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is evident that the Tribunal was seeking to ascertain information which had not been available to the Minister's delegate when she had made the decision to cancel the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In substance what was being asked for was further and better particulars of the submissions which had been made on 25 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The letter concluded with these paragraphs: 
 
 'You are invited to provide the requested information, in writing, within 28 calendar days of date of notification of this invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As this letter has been posted, you will be considered to have been notified of this information 7 working days after the date of this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Please note that "working days" do not include weekends or public holidays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 If you are unable to provide the requested information within this period, you may request in writing that you be allowed additional time in which to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Such a request would need to include reasons for the extension and to be received before the end of the above period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal will consider any request for an extension carefully, and advise you in writing, whether an extension of time has been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 If the Tribunal does not receive any additional information within the period allowed or as extended, it may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the information or to invite you to appear before the Tribunal' 
 
 
 8 It was accepted by counsel for the Minister that the time period allowed by the Tribunal for the provision of additional information was more generous than that prescribed by the Migration Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Had the correct requirements been stipulated the applicant's response would have been due on or before 17 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The deadline imposed by the Tribunal's letter required the additional information to be submitted no later than 6 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">These calculations are matters to which I will return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">9 The applicant provided a written response on 14 April 2005 and supplemented that response with documents which were given to the Tribunal on 18 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">10 By 18 April 2005 the Tribunal had realised the error which it had made when writing to the applicant on 28 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This resulted in the Tribunal writing to the applicant as follows: 
 
 'I refer to the Tribunal's letter of 28 February 2005 which indicated that you had 28 calendar days and 7 working days in which to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This period was incorrect and the Migration Regulations required you to respond within 12 working days of the date of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 Due to this error in the Tribunal's letter, the Tribunal would have accepted a response within the time period outlined in the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">However the response you have provided to the Tribunal was received on 14 April 2005 some 8 days after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 Accordingly pursuant to s 359C of the Migration Act 1958 the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 However, the Tribunal will allow you a further 2 weeks from the date of this letter to make further submissions if you wish to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">' 
 
 
 11 On 22 April 2005 the applicant's solicitor sent a facsimile letter to the Tribunal requesting that the Tribunal allow a further extension of time so that the applicant could obtain translations of some of his documents that had earlier been submitted to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">On 2 May 2005 the Tribunal advised the applicant's solicitor that it had granted the request for an extension of time and asked that the additional material be provided within 12 working days following the date of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The translations were provided within the time allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">12 On 8 August 2005 the Tribunal sent a further letter to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It was sent pursuant to s 359A of the Act and invited comment on 'particulars of any information that the Tribunal consider[ed] would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision which [was] under review ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The applicant's comment was then invited on certain information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">An explanation was given as to why the information was potentially relevant to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The comments were sought 'within 12 working days' of the date of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Tribunal received a timely response from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">13 The Tribunal handed down its decision on 12 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">14 Given the grounds relied on by the applicant in the present proceeding it is only necessary to make reference to one passage in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">That passage deals with its reasons for not according an oral hearing to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It reads: 
 
 '[45] The review applicant did not provide the information requested pursuant to s 359 of the Act before the time allowed for responding had passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Tribunal finds that the letter complied with s 379A(4) as it was sent within 3 working days of the date on the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Therefore pursuant to s 360(2)(c) the review applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal and pursuant to s 363A cannot be permitted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 
 
 15 The Tribunal further advised that it had made its decision based on the documentary material which it had received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">

<sentence id="s106">' 
 
 
 THE ALLEGED ERRORS 
 
 26 The applicant alleged that the Tribunal had committed a number of procedural errors in dealing with his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Each of these errors, it was alleged, constituted a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He identified the errors as being: 
 
 (a) The letter sent to the applicant on 28 February 2005 in purported compliance with s 359 of the Act failed to satisfy the requirement, imposed by s 359B(2) of the Act, that the request must specify the 'prescribed period' within which the information requested is to be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It followed, so it was contended, that the applicant was never lawfully 'invited' to provide additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It further followed that the applicant was not a person to whom subsection 359C(2) of the Act applied and he remained entitled to the oral hearing mandated by s 360 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(b) Even if the applicant had, by operation of ss 359C, 360 and 363A of the Act, ceased to have an entitlement to an oral hearing, it remained within the discretion of the Tribunal to conduct such a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It had failed to recognise that it had such a discretion and, as a result, had failed to consider whether or not it should conduct an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">(c) The Tribunal's letter of 18 April 2005 failed to provide the correct 'prescribed further period' in accordance with s 359B(4) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">(d) The issuing of the 18 April 2005 letter constituted the grant of an extension of time during which the applicant could respond to the invitation to provide additional information under s 359 of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that the extension was granted after the expiry of the period stipulated in the 28 February 2005 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Information was supplied within the extended period and, therefore, the Tribunal was in error in holding that it was precluded from conducting an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">(e) The Tribunal retained a discretion to allow the applicant's wife to give evidence at an oral hearing even if the applicant was precluded from doing so but the Tribunal failed to consider whether or not to exercise such a discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">(f) The Tribunal exceeded its power by purporting to cancel the applicant's oral hearing having validly invited him to a hearing in its letter of 3 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">
 ALLEGED ERROR (a) 
 
 27 This alleged error is said to arise from the terms of the letter sent by the Tribunal to the applicant on 28 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In particular it focuses on the first of the three quoted paragraphs appearing in [7] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The applicant was told that he had 28 calendar days from the date of notification of the invitation to him to provide the information sought by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The author of the letter apparently overlooked the fact that what was before the Tribunal was an application for review of a decision to cancel a visa --- a decision comprehended by reg 4.17(3) rather than reg 4.17(4) of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Under reg 4.17(3) of the Regulations the applicant should have been advised that he had five calendar days after the date of notification of the invitation to supply that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The applicant contended that the time limits imposed by s 359B(2) of the Act constituted an essential part of the statutory scheme for dealing with appeals to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Tribunal's letter of 28 February 2005 had not contained the period prescribed by reg 4.17 of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">As strict compliance was required, so the argument ran, the stipulation of the incorrect, but longer, period rendered the notice invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">That being so, no valid invitation had been issued under s 359B of the Act and, as a result, s 359C(1)(a) of the Act did not apply and in turn, s 360 of the Act did not operate to deprive the applicant of his right to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">28 The applicant relied on three cases to support his argument that strict compliance with the terms of s 359B(2) of the Act was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">They were SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, VEAN of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 311 ; (2003) 133 FCR 570 and Chan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1292 ; (2003) 134 FCR 308.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">None of these cases dealt with the construction of s 359B(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">29 In SAAP the High Court, by majority, held that a failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 424A of the Act constituted a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Section 424A of the Act required the Tribunal to give an applicant particulars in writing of any information which it considered would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">This obligation was cast in mandatory terms ('must').</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It was held that the Tribunal erred when it conveyed orally in the course of a hearing the substance of evidence on which it proposed to rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Justice McHugh (at 183) held that s 424A of the Act was one of the centrepieces of the statutory procedural fairness regime incorporated in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">A failure to comply with its terms went to the heart of the decision making process and led to any resultant decision being invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Justices Kirby and Hayne (at 203 and 211 respectively) came to a similar conclusion because of the mandatory language of s 424A of the Act and 'the character of the decision'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">30 The decision of the Full Court of this Court in VEAN turned on the question of whether a letter addressed to an applicant 'care of' a relative was a legally effective means of giving notice of a decision made under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Court (at 576) found it to be unnecessary to deal with an alternative argument concerning the legal consequences, if any, which might flow from a misstatement of temporal requirements prescribed by legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">31 In Chan Ta Srey Gray J held that a requirement imposed by of s 66(2)(d)(ii) of the Act had not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The requirement was that an applicant for a visa should be advised of a decision to refuse such an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Notification of the decision had to include ('must') the time in which an application for review of the decision could be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Justice Gray held that the requirement was not fulfilled when the applicant was advised that review could be sought 'within 28 days of the date of this letter'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">As the requirement had not been satisfied there had not been a 'notification' of the delegate's decision and time had not commenced to run against the applicant in relation to the making of an application to review the decision or the calculation of the period after which his bridging visa would expire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">32 The applicant's submission, correctly, did not suggest that all breaches of the procedural requirements imposed by the Act would give rise to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Rather, it was submitted, that assistance could be found in the cases relied on when the task of construing s 359(2) of the Act was undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">33 The question of whether or not a failure to comply with procedural requirements renders the relevant decision invalid will be determined having regard to the considerations identified by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390-91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Attention will be directed to the language of the particular statutory provision and the scope and object of the Act in which the provision appears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The reviewing court will also seek to discern whether the legislature should be understood as intending that a failure of an administrative authority to comply with the procedural requirement should lead to the invalidity of any consequential decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">34 Section 359A of the Act imposes the obligation of disclosure on the Tribunal in the same terms as those which are used in s 424A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The obligation falls on the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It is imposed so in imperative terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The section forms part of a statutory scheme designed to provide procedural fairness to applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">A failure to comply with all aspects of the scheme compromises the scheme and renders any resultant decision invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">SAAP compels the conclusion that any failure by the Tribunal to do what s 359A of the Act requires will result in invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">35 Section 359B of the Act is, on its face, a more flexible provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is designed to avoid extended delays in the decision making process in circumstances where the Tribunal chooses or is required to seek additional information or comment from an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">If there is a prescribed period that period is to be specified in the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Otherwise a reasonable period limitation is imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">By s 359B(4) of the Act the Tribunal may extend a prescribed period for a prescribed further period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The burden of any temporal requirement falls on an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">There is no requirement that an applicant respond to an invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">No imperative obligation is, in terms, imposed on the Tribunal by s 359B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">36 There can be no doubt that the provisions of s 359B (2) of the Act form part of the statutory scheme which is designed to ensure procedural fairness for applicants before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">However, it does not assume a position as close to the core of the scheme as the notice provisions which were considered in SAAP .</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Invitations to provide information will not be extended to applicants in all cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">When they are there is a degree of flexibility allowed as to the time in which a response may be made consistent with the statutory intention that the decision making process should not unduly be delayed when such invitations are extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">True it is that the response time, where a period is prescribed, will be specified in the invitation but the obligation to so stipulate is not imposed on the Tribunal in mandatory terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Furthermore the type of provision considered in SAAP will, if not complied with, deprive an applicant of a significant procedural safeguard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The same is not necessarily true of a failure accurately to state the period within which an applicant should respond to an invitation, issued under s 359 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">If the period stipulated is shorter or longer than that prescribed this could but will not necessarily lead to an applicant losing an entitlement to be invited to attend an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">For these reasons I am not persuaded that a legislative intention can be discerned that a misstatement of the prescribed period in the letter of invitation should lead to invalidity of the Tribunal's ultimate decision at least in circumstances where, as here, the time stated was more generous than that prescribed, the applicant did not respond within the time stated, the applicant subsequently provided information sought and that information was taken into account by the Tribunal when it made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">37 A similar conclusion was reached by Jacobson J in SZEXZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 449.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">His Honour was called on to determine whether a breach of s 424B(2) of the Act gave rise to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Section 424B of the Act is in the same terms as s 359B of the Act and applies to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Refugee Review Tribunal had sought information from the applicant under s 424 of the Act and the letter requested a response within a period which was longer than that prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">His Honour distinguished SAAP having regard to the differences between ss 424A and 424 B of the Act which are the same differences which exist as between ss 359A and 359B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He concluded (at [49]) that a breach of s 424B(2) of the Act 'which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, [did not] render invalid a decision given after the breach'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">This, he held, 'must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">' 38 Lest I be wrong on the principal issue I would indicate that I would, in any event, have refused relief on the ground that the applicant suffered no injustice by reason of the misstatement of the prescribed period: see SAAP at 184; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 108-9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Even though he provided the information after the time stipulated by the Tribunal his response was considered by the Tribunal as were the other comprehensive written submissions made on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 ALLEGED ERROR (b) 
 
 39 Section 360 of the Act ensures that, subject to certain limited exceptions, all applicants are invited to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and make submissions in support of their applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">One of the exceptions, provided for in s 360(2)(c) of the Act arises where s 359C(1) of the Act applies to an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Section 359C(1) of the Act so applies where an invitation to provide additional information has been extended under s 359 and that information has not been provided within the time stipulated in the letter of invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">An applicant to whom one of the exceptions provided for in s 360(2) of the Act applies 'is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal': see s 360(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Had the legislative scheme contained nothing more of relevance, an applicant whose circumstances brought him within one of the exceptions provided for in s 360(2) of the Act could be said to have lost the right to an invitation to appear before the Tribunal but might, in the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion, nonetheless, be extended an invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">40 In the present case the Tribunal did not consider that it had such a discretion and therefore did not consider the exercise of such a discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">So much is evident from the extract from its reasons which appears above at [14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The Tribunal held that the applicant was not entitled to appear before it 'and pursuant to s 363A cannot be permitted to do so'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">41 The applicant's argument in support of the second alleged error hinges on the proper construction of these provisions and, in particular, the effect of s 363A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">42 The applicant placed principal reliance on the joint judgment of Wilcox and Branson JJ in Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 218.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">That case, like the present, involved a failure of an applicant to make a timely response to an invitation (in that case extended under s 359A of the Act) with the result that the Tribunal dealt with the application on the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Tribunal said that it did this in accordance with s 359C of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Judicial review was sought in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Relevantly, the Federal Magistrate held that: 
 
 'the Tribunal was under no obligation to make any decision regarding whether it would or would not allow the applicant a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">In particular, subsection (1) of s 360 did not apply to the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Clearly s 359C(1) did apply to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Accordingly, it follows that there has been no failure of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">' 
 

On appeal it was contended that the Federal Magistrate had erred by finding that the Tribunal was under no obligation to make any decision as to whether it would or would not allow the applicant a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">In dealing with this ground their Honours in Uddin said:

 
 '[59] The appellant contended that the Tribunal made its decision to affirm the cancellation of the appellant's visa on the false assumption that since he was not entitled to a hearing before the Tribunal, the Tribunal could not afford him a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 
 [60] ... 
 
 [61] We accept that the Tribunal was free, had it wished to do so, to accord the appellant an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">We see no reason to conclude that the Tribunal thought otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The reference in its reasons for its decision to the appellant being 'no longer entitled' to a hearing suggests a correct understanding of the legal position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Nothing in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal suggested that it proceeded on an assumption that it was not empowered to grant the appellant a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In the circumstances that happened the Tribunal was entitled to decide the matter before it in the way that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">' 
 

The other member of the Court, Bennett J, agreed with Wilcox and Branson JJ on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 43 It does not appear that either the Federal Magistrate or the Full Court was referred to s 363A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">This also appears to have been the case in two decisions of the Federal Magistrates' Court which were also relied on by the applicant: see Ramnares v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FMCA 683 at [19] and Sharma v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 20 at [11] and [14]-[22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">44 It is to be noted that, in each of these three cases, the applicant did not succeed, notwithstanding the failure of the court to consider the effect of s 363A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In each case this was because the Court was not prepared to infer that the Tribunal had not turned its mind to the exercise of an assumed discretion to invite the applicant to appear before it, even though the Tribunal did not refer specifically to having considered the exercise of such a discretion in its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">45 Counsel for both parties referred me to a more recent Full Court decision in which the effect of s 363A of the Act was dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">That decision was Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Jing Shan Sun [2005] FCAFC 201 ; (2005) 146 FCR 498.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Sun was primarily concerned with the efficacy of multiple invitations being given by the Tribunal to an applicant under ss 359 and 359A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The Court held that there was no provision of the Act which would prevent the Tribunal giving multiple notices in the course of dealing with a particular application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The Court considered that there would be cases in which the Tribunal might be obliged to act in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In this context the Court observed (at 509): 
 
 'Section 363A would not prevent the Tribunal from acting in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">It says that the Tribunal does not have power to permit a visa applicant to do a thing in relation to a review if the visa applicant is, by a provision in Pt 5, not entitled to do that thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Section 360(3) disentitles a visa applicant from appearing before the Tribunal if any of the circumstances in s 360(2) apply, relevantly here if s 359C(2) applies to the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Consequently, s 363A would appear to disempower the Tribunal from allowing the first respondent to appear before the Tribunal in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">But there is no provision disentitling the visa applicant from providing such information to the Tribunal as that visa applicant considers to be pertinent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">And notwithstanding that s 359C(2) applies to that visa applicant, such information may include information provided belatedly pertaining to information referred to in an invitation under s 359A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">That was what the Tribunal gave the first respondent the opportunity to do ... in the present matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">' (Emphasis added) 


Counsel for the Minister relied on the sentence which has been emphasised in the quoted passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Counsel for the applicant acknowledges the potential relevance of the sentence for present purposes but emphasises the Court was expressing itself tentatively and that what it said did not form part of the ratio of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Section 363A has been in the Act since 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It was introduced by the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 5) 1994 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill stated that the new s 363A 'ensures that the IRT has no discretion to allow a person (including any assistant or representative) to do something where a provision provides that the person is not entitled to do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">' Counsel for the applicant very properly drew my attention to this part of the memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Not surprisingly, it was relied on by counsel for the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">
 46 In my view s 363A of the Act has the effect contended for by the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Section 360(3) of the Act provides that a consequence of an applicant failing to provide information to the Tribunal in a timely way following an invitation to do so is that the applicant ceases to have an entitlement to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Section 363A of the Act operates to remove any residual discretion the Tribunal may have had to permit an applicant to appear notwithstanding his or her loss of an entitlement to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The language of the section is clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The construction which I have placed upon it is consistent with the observation of the Full Court in Sun and the terms of the explanatory memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">To the extent that the dictum in Sun may be said to be inconsistent with that of the Full Court in Uddin the differences are relevantly explicable by the absence of any reference to s 363A of the Act in the joint reasons in the latter case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 ALLEGED ERROR (c) 
 
 47 The applicant contends that the terms of the Tribunal's letter of 18 April 2005 (set out above at [10]), disclosed procedural error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">That error, so it was submitted, was that the letter 'failed to provide the correct 'prescribed further period' in accordance with s 359B(4) of the Act because the Tribunal granted the applicant an extension of two weeks rather than the prescribed period of five working days from notification of the extension'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The allegation of error is founded on the assumption that the 18 April 2005 letter recorded an exercise of the Tribunal's power under s 359B(4) of the Act, to enlarge time within which to provide the information sought in its letter of 28 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">48 In my view a fair reading of the Tribunal's letter makes it plain that no such exercise of power was involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Tribunal acknowledged its earlier error and noted that the applicant's response had been received out of time --- even if the more generous period allowed by the Tribunal had been the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It then went on to note the consequence provided for in s 359C of the Act, namely, that the Tribunal could, had it so wished, have proceeded to deal with the application on the material then before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">However, it chose to provide the applicant with the opportunity to make further submissions should he so desire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">A period of two weeks was stipulated as the time within which those submissions should be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It is to be noted that this period was not expressed by reference to 'working days' and that it did not coincide with any of the prescribed periods to be found on 4.18A of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">49 As the Full Court held in Sun , there is nothing in the Act which would preclude the Tribunal from seeking additional information after an earlier request has been made but not complied with within a prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">On the contrary, as the Full Court said, there are sound practical reasons why the Tribunal may wish to pursue such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">If it chooses to do so, it will not disturb the position which has crystallised under the Act whereby an applicant is precluded from asserting an entitlement to an oral hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">
 ALLEGED ERROR (d) 
 
 50 This alleged error is related to Alleged Error (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The applicant's argument begins with the proposition that the April letter recorded an exercise of the Tribunal's power under s 359B(4) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">This is said to have re-enlivened the applicant's right to an oral hearing pursuant to s 360 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">This, so the argument runs, was because the April letter provided an extension of the time stipulated in the February letter, the applicant had responded within the extended time period (presumably by the sending of the solicitor's letter on 14 April 2005) and did not, as a result, fall within ss 359C(1) and 360(2)(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">51 For reasons which I have explained in dealing with Alleged Error (c), this contention falls at the threshold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">There was no enlargement of time under s 359B(4) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">52 In any event, it may be doubted that there was scope for the Tribunal, even if it had been minded to do so, to extend time to comply with the request made on 28 February 2005, after the period stipulated for compliance in that letter had passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Section 359B(4) of the Act is cast in the present tense ('If a person is to respond ...' and 'the response is to be made ...').</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">This, as the Full Court noted in Sun (at 509-510) suggests that any application for an enlargement of time must be made while the time stipulated in the original letter of request is still running.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The Full Court did not find it necessary to determine the question (see at 510) but, in Usman v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2005] FMCA 966 at [44] , Pascoe CFM held that the power granted by s 359B(4) of the Act could only be exercised within the period allowed when the original request was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Had it been necessary to do so I would have held that the Tribunal could not have enlarged time pursuant to s 359B(4) of the Act after, at the latest, 6 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 ALLEGED ERROR (e) 
 
 53 The applicant contends that, even if the Tribunal lacked power to invite him to attend an oral hearing, it nonetheless retained a discretion to invite his wife to attend and give evidence in support of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It is contended that the Tribunal did not consider the exercise of such a discretion and thereby made a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">54 The legislative scheme provided for in Division 5 of Part 5 of the Act, as has been seen, deals in great detail with the circumstances in which an applicant is and is not entitled to an oral hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">If the Act operates so as to deny the Tribunal the power to conduct a hearing with the applicant present, it is unlikely that, in the absence of any express enabling provision, the Tribunal would have the power to hear (orally) from a witness nominated by such an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Such a doubt is strengthened by the provisions of ss 360A and 361 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Section 360A provides that, where an applicant is to be invited to appear before the Tribunal, the applicant is to be given written notice of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">By s 361(1) of the Act the notice must advise the applicant of his or her entitlement to give written notice to the Tribunal that he or she wants the Tribunal to obtain oral evidence from named persons: see s 361(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">If an applicant so advises the Tribunal the Tribunal must have regard to the notice but is not required to comply with it: see s 361(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The power of the Tribunal to accord an oral hearing to a nominated witness is thereby linked to and made dependent upon the applicant him or herself having an entitlement to an oral hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Moreover, the Tribunal is not bound to accede to such a request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">55 For these reasons I consider that the Tribunal was not required to give consideration to conducting an oral hearing for the purpose of taking evidence from the applicant's wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The Tribunal did, nonetheless, afford the applicant the opportunity to provide written submissions about the issues on which the applicant now contends he would have wished the Tribunal to hear evidence from his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">
 ALLEGED ERROR (f) 
 
 56 The final error which is attributed to the Tribunal is that it did not have power to cancel the oral hearing which it had scheduled for 25 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The applicant contends that, while the Tribunal may reschedule or adjourn a hearing (see ss 362B(2) and 363(1)(b)) of the Act, there is no power to cancel a scheduled hearing such that it never occurs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">57 I am not persuaded that this is a proper characterisation of what occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The Tribunal's letter of 3 February 2005 fixed a hearing for 25 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Having received the applicant's lengthy submission from his solicitors the Tribunal vacated the hearing date and sent the letter of 28 February 2005 in which it sought additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">That letter requested that the information be provided within a certain time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It was not so provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">By operation of ss 359C(1), 360(2)(c) and 363A of the Act the statutory consequence was that the Tribunal no longer had power to permit the applicant to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">That consequence was not the result of any decision to cancel the hearing, rather it was the result of the failure of the applicant to respond in a timely manner to the Tribunal's invitation to provide additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">At no point did the Tribunal cancel the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">What it did, sometime in late February 2005, was to postpone the hearing pending receipt of further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">When that information was not supplied in a timely manner the Tribunal was deprived of any power to conduct the hearing by operation of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">
