 Introduction 
 
1 Pastor Guzu Dorogori, a resident of Papua New Guinea, seeks review of a Deputy District Registrar's decision refusing to join him as a party to the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The motion for review is some 18 months out of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For the reasons that appear below, however, I will deal with the motion on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">No relevant interest which may be affected by a native title determination in the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim being disclosed the motion for review will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Factual and procedural background 
 
2 Pastor Dorogori sought joinder as a party under s 84(5) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NT Act) by a motion filed on 22 July 2005, which was purportedly brought on behalf of Hiamo-Tureture Villagers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In that motion he asserted that the Hiamo-Tureture people were the descendents of the original Hiamo landowners, Daru Aboriginal people who sailed out through the Torres Strait islands because of attacks from other tribes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The motion was adjourned by order of Connard DDR on 25 August 2005 with a direction that any further affidavits upon which Pastor Dorogori proposed to rely should be filed and served by 8 September 2005 and that they should address the requirements of s 84 of the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 22 September 2005 no affidavits had been filed and the notice of motion was dismissed by Connard DDR with no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Pastor Dorogori filed the motion now before the Court on 30 April 2007 in effect seeking review of the order of dismissal made on 22 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">An affidavit in support of the motion for review gave no explanation for the delay that has ensued since the original motion was dismissed on 22 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The affidavit annexed materials said to be relevant to Pastor Dorogori's family history and links to the Torres Strait sea claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 In Annexure A to the affidavit an account was given of the origins of the Hiamo Umumere people represented by Pastor Dorogori.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It was entitled:
 
 HOW WE HIAMO UMUMERE TRIBES SEPARATED OURSELF FROM DARU AND BOBO ISLAND 
 

5 Pastor Dorogori referred to historical attacks upon Hiamo people living on Daru Island by other indigenous people in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Because of those attacks the Hiamo people decided to emigrate from Daru and Bobo Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They could not however take everybody with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The weak and the sick decided to stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The people settled at Murilago and created a ceremony called Tuera.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Songs sung during their exodus are still sung in connection with that ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 Pastor Dorogori said that his people were those who remained on Daru and Bobo Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He said: 
 
 We the Hiamo Umumere living on Daru is therefore writing this story to tell you that we are part of those Hiamo Umumere living there in the Torres Strait Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Hiamo Umumere's ancestor really originated from Cape York in Bamaga.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Than they moved from there as a group to PNG waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">[sic]
 
 They settled Bob[o] island some at Daru Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">They lived happily there but some how because of killing taking place they have to moved back to where they came from.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">But because of no space in the canoes some have to stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">So now we are the ones who stayed back in Daru and Bobo island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">[sic]
 
 Therefore we are writing this story to make you understand that, that is the reason why we separated from each others but we are one Hiamo Umu Mere tribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The spokesman Charley Irigia did not explain this in the Torres Strait sea claim federal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Therefore we are writing this story to you because they want to know how our relationship is with the Torres Strait Himao Umumere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">[sic]
 

7 In a separate annexure marked "B", Pastor Dorogori stated his grounds or reasons for his application saying: 
 
 BECAUSE OF MY HIAMO TRIBS MAN, ORIGION AN IMMIGRATED FROM THE MURULUG ISLAND OR HONA ISLAND ACCORDANCE TO OUR HISTORY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">THERE FOR I APPEALING SEA CLAIM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">SO, THAT IS MY RESON FOR APPEALING [sic]
 

He then asserted a right to claim because his tribe is the owner of the reefs and the sea as well as the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">8 A third annexure set out a genealogy for the Hiamu Umumere clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It showed a person called Guza, a male in a line of descent through another male called Dorogori.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The line of descent was ultimately traced back to a male called "Kaiku" and before that to one Kabai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The timeframe of the genealogy did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was evidently produced in 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">9 In oral submissions in support of the application Pastor Dorogori referred to the existence of the sea claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He appeared to assert some positive entitlement for his own people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He also said: 
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I was neglected a long time, my clanspeople living neglected across all villages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">My clanspeople was neglected, and long suffering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">And this is my aim, where I feel that I must line up, fill my form for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

He asked what right the Commonwealth Government would have to give to the Torres Strait Aboriginal Authority what it plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He appeared to be suggesting that he and his clan should be included in any determination of rights in relation to the Torres Strait Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He claimed to be an original inhabitant of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">10 The motion was opposed by the applicants on the basis that it was out of time and that there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The applicants appear to have treated the motion as an application for leave to appeal governed by O 52 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">This was not a correct characterisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The application was for a review under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) of a Registrar's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">They submitted that in any event, the joinder should be refused on the basis that no relevant interest in the claim area was identified nor any interest shown that might be affected by a determination in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">11 The Commonwealth in its submissions noted that Pastor Dorogori did not identify any area of land or reefs or sea within the claim area and in respect of which he asserted ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Nor was there any material to support such an assertion or to provide any basis for it under traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Statutory framework - review of Registrar's decisions 
 
12 Section 35A of the Act makes provision for Registrars to exercise the powers of the Court and provides, inter alia: 
 
 35A(1) Subject to sub-section (2), the following powers of the Court may, if the Court or a Judge so directs, be exercised by a Registrar: 
 ...
 
 (h) a power of the Court prescribed by Rules of Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">...
 
 (5) A party to proceedings in which a Registrar has exercised any of the powers of the Court under sub-section (1) may, within the time prescribed by the Rules of Court, or within any further time allowed in accordance with the Rules of Court, apply to the court to review that exercise of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">(6) The Court may, on application under sub-section (5) or of its own motion, review an exercise of power by a Registrar pursuant to this section and may make such order or orders as it thinks fit with respect to the matter with respect to which the power was exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">

13 The term "proceedings" used in s 35A(5) takes its meaning from the definition of "proceeding" in s 4 of the Act which: 
 
 means a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding, and also includes an appeal;
 

This definition clearly covers a motion for joinder as a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 

14 Order 78, r 3A of the Federal Court Rules provides: 
 
 For the purposes of paragraph 35A(1)(h) of the Act, the Court or a Judge may direct a Registrar to exercise a power of the Court under a provision of the Native Title Act mentioned in Schedule 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

15 Schedule 4 to the Rules sets out the powers of the Court that may be exercised by a Registrar under the NT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Item 6 in that schedule refers to s 84 of the NT Act and describes the delegated powers thus: 
 
 Power to make orders for the joinder, dismissal, withdrawal, cessation or representation of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

The time limit for seeking review of a Registrar's decision prescribed for the purposes of s 35A(5) is set out in O 46, r 7B(1) which provides: 
 
 
 Subject to any direction by the Court or a Judge to the contrary, an application under subsection 35A(5) of the Act for review of the exercise of a power of the Court by a Registrar under subsection 35A(1) of the Act must be made by motion on notice within 21 days after the day on which the power was exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 

 Statutory framework --- joinder 
 
 16 The application for joinder was made under s 84 of the NT Act which, as it stood at the time of the Registrar's decision, provided in subs (5): 
 
 The Federal Court may at any time join any person as a party to the proceedings, if the Court is satisfied that the person's interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

 The merits of the motion 
 
17 In my opinion the motion should properly be dealt with on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">There has been a very substantial delay in bringing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">On the other hand issues relating to the joinder of Papua New Guinean parties have only recently been resolved by the Full Court and orders made on 16 November 2007 governing their participation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The orders made would apply to Pastor Dorogori if he were to be joined as a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">There is no relevant prejudice to any other party in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I therefore decided to deal with the motion for review on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">18 On its merits the motion for review must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">There is no basis upon which I could be satisfied that a determination over a Torres Strait regional sea claim area may affect any interest of Pastor Dorogori.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In so concluding I have regard to the principles for the identification of relevant interests in Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 148 ALR 46 and various cases in which that case has been followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">A relevant interest, as was said in Arakwal 148 ALR 46, must be (at 51): 
 
 ... capable of clear definition and, equally importantly, ... of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">

19 I took account of all the material relied upon by Pastor Dorogori.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">He asserts in reliance upon that material: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That he has a link to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">That he and the people he represents have a history in the Torres Strait claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">That he is the owner of reefs, seas and waters in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The assertion of ownership of reefs, seas and waters is no more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">No historical basis for such a claim is disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The location of areas allegedly owned by Mr Dorogori and his people is not disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The fact that he may be descended from people who came from an island in the Torres Strait does not, of itself, support the inference that there is some kind of interest which may be affected by a determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">20 In my opinion the motion should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
