<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The parties have tendered a minute of directions in each proceeding, consensual in all respects save one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The one outstanding point is that which relates to the basis on which the applicants should pay the respondents' costs on the notices of motions dated 8 January 2007 including any costs thrown away in relation to the amendment of the statements of claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondents submit that the applicants should pay the costs forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicants oppose that aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The starting point is O 62 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules which provides:
 
 
 '3(1) The Court may in any proceeding exercise its powers and discretions as to costs at any stage of the proceeding or after the conclusion of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 3(2) Where the Court makes an order in any proceeding for the payment of costs the Court may require that the costs be paid forthwith notwithstanding that the proceeding is not concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 3(3) An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceeding in which the interlocutory order was made is concluded or further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">' 
 

3 The circumstances on which the respondents rely to support the making of an order by the Court that the costs be paid forthwith on each proceeding, are as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Firstly, they submit that each of the statement of claims as filed on 31 October 2006 have effectively been almost abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Only five paragraphs remain unaltered in each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Eight have been struck out and many pages of new allegations added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These statements of claims had resulted from an order made by French J on 29 August 2006 requiring the applicants to commence the actions by 1 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There had, therefore, been opportunity for the statement of claim in each matter to have been properly drafted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The reality is, say the respondents, that it has taken from 1 November 2006 until present for the pleadings to be finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 The history of the proceedings from the record is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In the pre-action discovery matter (WAD 21/2005) his Honour made orders on 29 August 2006 that relevantly state:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the event that the applicants have not by 1 November 2006 commenced proceedings against the respondents they shall pay the respondents' reasonable costs of and incidental to the provision of the discovery affidavit and inspection of documents in compliance with orders made in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In the event that such proceedings are commenced by 1 November 2006 the costs shall, subject to the following order, be costs in the cause...' 
 

5 The pre-action discovery proceeding has been adjourned at the request of the parties at a directions hearing initially on 2 November 2006 and then by consent on 2 February 2007, 23 March 2007, 30 April 2007 and 28 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Proceedings by the third applicant were discontinued by consent on 5 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The proceeding was then adjourned on 12 July 2007 and then again on 20 July 2007 by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 In the main actions (WAD 308-310/2006) the applicants filed their applications on 31 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 11 December 2006 the following relevant orders were made on each file:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The first and second respondents file and serve any application pursuant to Order 11 Rule 16 and Order 20 Rule 2 by 8 January 2007, together with an outline of submissions in support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">By 29 January 2007, the applicant file and serve any written outline of submissions in response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The application to strike-out be set down for oral argument on 5 February 2007 not before 3:15 pm, and for further directions...' 
 

7 The first and second respondents filed a notice of motion on 8 January 2007 together with a supporting affidavit and submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On 2 February 2007 the Court ordered by consent that the applicants file and serve their submissions in response by 6 March 2007 and that the notice of motion be heard on 12 March 2007 at a time to be fixed, no submissions were received from the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The matter was then adjourned by consent on 12 March 2007, 26 March 2007, 26 April 2007 and 12 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">8 On 12 July 2007 the applicant was ordered to file a proposed amended statement of claim on WAD 308/2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The respondents were ordered to file and serve any specific objections to the proposed amended statement of claim with any amended notice for dismissal or strike out within 7 days, none was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">On 1 August 2007 the parties attended the directions hearing at which time the issue of costs being payable forthwith was raised for the first time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">9 The applicants oppose the order for payment of costs forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">They state that the success of the respondents' notice of motions have been satisfactorily met by the applicants' agreement to pay the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">However, the applicants say there was an absence of conferral by the respondents before each motion was brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In those circumstances, by comparison with the Rules of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, there would be disentitlement to an award of costs, certainly costs payable forthwith, if there was no conferral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the applicants' submissions, the history of these matters do not justify departure from the Rule reflected in O 62 r 3(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">10 In reply the respondents refer to the affidavit of Lucy Westwood sworn on 8 January 2007 to support their contention that there was a willingness to confer on their part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">11 In Shahid v The Australasian College of Dermatologists [2006] FCA 414 at [5] - [6] I said:
 
 'The respondent relies on the reasoning in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 and Sereika v Cardinal Financial Securities Ltd (formerly Inteq Custodians Ltd) [2001] FCA 687.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 In McKellar , Weinberg J followed the approach taken by Branson J in Life Airbag Co of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Co (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 and Kiefel J in Harris v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-445.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In Harris , Kiefel J accepted that an order that certain costs be taxed and paid forthwith was justified in circumstances where there had been a long delay in the course of the proceeding by the pursuit of an ill-considered and unnecessary claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It is common ground that the making of the order sought by the notice of motion is a matter in the discretion of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">' 

In Airservices Australia v Jeppersen Sanderson Inc [2006] FCA 906 at [31] - [32] Graham J said:
 
 'In lengthy and complex cases where substantial costs have been thrown away as a result of ill-considered pleadings being drawn, the power to order that costs thrown away be paid forthwith should be used less sparingly than it has in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Such costs should be capable of being recovered without the innocent party having to wait, possibly years, for that to occur (per Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Limited [1999] FCA 1639 at [41] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 The making of an order under Order 62 rule 3 is justified where, through no fault of a party, such as the first and second respondents in the present case, there has been substantial delay in the proceedings because an applicant has attempted a number of versions of the Application and of the Statement of Claim, additional directions hearings have taken place which should not have been necessary, interlocutory steps have been taken and applications have been brought unnecessarily given the changes to the pleadings that have occurred (see All Services Australia Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2000) 171 ALR 330 at 333 [11].</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 

12 In my view it cannot be found in the present circumstances that the substantial delay is not without involvement of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">This is because the respondents have consented to the adjournment of hearings which may have enabled the proceedings to be advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In these circumstances I do not consider the evidence is such as to support the exercise of the Court's discretion in favour of making the costs payable 'forthwith'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.</sentence>
