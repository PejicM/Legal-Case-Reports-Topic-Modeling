<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The plaintiff brings this action to recover a parcel of 1,230,593 shares in the capital of Restaurant Brands New Zealand (RBNZ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The shares are presently registered in the name of the first defendant, Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The plaintiff asserts that it has a beneficial interest in those shares in the nature of an equity of redemption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The second defendant, Opes Prime Stockbroking Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (admin apptd), also claims an interest in the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It contends (through its receivers) that it is the sole beneficial owner of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The issue presently to be resolved is whether the plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There are two impediments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">First, since the commencement of the action Green Frog was placed into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Second, at an earlier point in the proceeding the plaintiff gave an undertaking it would not proceed with the action without leave of court or consent of the administrators of OPS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 The background may be described briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The plaintiff, which is in the restaurant business, engaged Opes Prime Paradigm Pty Ltd, a company that is related to OPS, to act on its behalf in relation to the acquisition of the shares in RBNZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The plaintiff's intention was to purchase the shares partly with its own funds and partly with borrowed money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It claims that OPS agreed to lend it the money it needed on the security of the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The plaintiff contends the agreement was in the nature of a margin loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">OPS, on the other hand, says that the principal terms of the agreement with the plaintiff are to be found in a Global Master Securities Lending Agreement (GMSLA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">If the GMSLA contains the relevant terms of the bargain then the plaintiff would have no proprietary interest in the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">3 When it became apparent to the plaintiff that its claim to an interest in the shares was not accepted by OPS, it commenced this action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">At the time Green Frog was not in liquidation, but OPS had been placed into administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On the application of the plaintiff I made orders restraining Green Frog from disposing of the shares pending the trial of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Section 440D of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) provides for a stay of proceedings against the property of a company in administration in the absence of the administrator's consent or leave of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The cases say the section applies to property claimed by a company in administration even if its title is in dispute and even if the property is held by a third party: see Cope v Home [2002] NSWSC 777.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Accordingly I granted the plaintiff leave to bring the action to obtain the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">However, so as to not interfere too much with the administration, as a condition of the grant of leave I required the plaintiff to undertake not to proceed any further with the action without leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I had in mind the possibility that following an investigation of the plaintiff's claim the action might be compromised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">4 There has been no settlement and the plaintiff wishes to continue with its action to recover what it alleges is its property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It now faces two hurdles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Not only is there the undertaking, there is, as well, s 500 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) which effects a stay of the action against Green Frog except with leave of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">5 OPS says that it will consent to proceedings being continued in respect of property over which it claims title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It gives this consent through the receivers who as the company's managers have control of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">If the consent was required for purposes of overcoming the stay imposed by s 440D it could not be given by OPS or the receivers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Section 440D permits an administrator to consent to a proceeding being brought in relation to the property of a company in administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">But there is no reason why OPS through its receivers could not consent to the plaintiff being released from its undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That does not fall under s 440D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">This notwithstanding, if I were of the view that the administration would be prejudiced to the release, I would not accede to the plaintiff's application without notice to the administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">That is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">6 So far as Green Frog is concerned, the liquidator does not oppose leave being granted under s 500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The liquidator has indicated that he intends to take no part in the action and will leave it to OPS to oppose the plaintiff's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In any event, it is appropriate to grant the leave sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Green Frog is a necessary party to the action as it is the legal owner of the shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It is usual in that circumstance to grant leave: Rio Grande do Sul Steamship Co, Re (1887) LR 5 Ch D 282; Marshall v Glamorgan Iron &amp; Coal Co (1868-69) LR 7 Eq 129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I will, however, impose a condition that no judgment for a money sum be executed without leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There is no money claim against Green Frog but I wish to guard against the possibility that the plaintiff might execute any costs order it might recover against Green Frog.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Associate:
