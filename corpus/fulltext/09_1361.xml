<sentence id="s0">
 This practice application arises because of a perception, which is not ill-founded, on behalf of the Applicants that there has been a studied non-compliance by the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents which directions made in respect of the management of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 951 (Aon Insurance), has recently emphasised the role of case management in the modern era in the conduct of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It is the practice of this Court, and has been since its inception, for cases actively to be managed by judges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Directions in respect of interlocutory steps in a case given by a judge are not aspirational statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The particular events of non-compliance are helpfully summarised in a table which forms part of the submissions made on behalf of the Applicants which is annexure A to the reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It does seem that the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents are not disposed to ignore Court orders in the sense that eventually there is compliance of sorts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">That does not though mean that there is not an event of default of a kind which enlivens a jurisdiction under O 35A r 2 of the Federal Court Rules to give default judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The case is one listed for mediation on 27 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That is a factor I take into account in deciding whether to give default judgment as requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There is a controversy in relation to the adequacy of the amended defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Further and, with all due respect, belatedly, there has also been a degree of controversy raised in relation to the amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is no reflection on Mr Abaza who, to my recollection, has not appeared in the past in this matter, to say that that particular criticism is raised late and gives rise to a concern that notwithstanding the period since April, it forms yet another part of a lack of engagement on the part of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents with bringing the case to hearing with due expedition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The exigencies of time today do not permit a detailed scrutiny of the adequacy of the amended defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It does though, at least raise sufficient indication of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents' position to give some meaningful content to a mediation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I was initially concerned, particularly, about an absence of the provision of a list of documents as ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It seems that that has been filed out of time and served yet further and later in a way which does not admit of ready explanation for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Rather than give judgment in default, what I propose to do is to stand over the application made by the Applicants to 9.30am on 8 February 2010, at which time, in the event that the case is not resolved at mediation, I shall hear and determine it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I also propose --- in light of the reservations raised by the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents --- to allow them on that day to make submissions in respect of the amended statement of claim but to do so on motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">That motion is to be filed and served not later than Friday 4 December 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I should make it plain that, in light of past events, if it is not filed and served by that date it will not be entertained, but rather the matter will proceed on 8 February 2010 on the Applicants' amended notice of motion read today alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Another event of default which occurred which adds only to the litany of casual compliance, or casual non-compliance as it is perhaps better termed, came in respect of the attempted lodgement this morning of submissions on behalf of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents that ought to have been earlier lodged in accordance with directions made last week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That particular non-compliance has had the effect that it was not possible to make efficient use of the limited time available today in respect of the application brought by the First and Second Applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In turn, that has meant that those Applicants have incurred costs which they might not otherwise have incurred, in the sense that, insofar as the substantive hearing determination was concerned, that necessarily will have to be done on 8 February 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Indemnity costs have been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The categories in respect of which indemnity costs might be ordered are not closed: see Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Rather, there is a discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The awarding of indemnity costs is exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In the ordinary course of events a litigant is entitled only to party and party costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That is part and parcel of the burden any litigant assumes in choosing to bring a matter to court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Here, though, the latest and last event of non-compliance persuades me that these Respondents --- the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents --- are either unable or unwilling to accept the fact that, as I have stated, directions are not aspirational statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I see this, therefore, as a case which warrants the awarding of indemnity costs in respect of the costs of today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Further, it seems to me that an appropriate way to bring focus on the part of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents to responsibilities that attend litigation is to direct that those costs be taxed and paid forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">For completeness, I should mention that it was raised on behalf of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents that the proceedings themselves were stayed under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) given that, apparently, the First and Second Respondents are in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">My understanding, though, of the operation of the Corporations Act is that the proceedings, as against the companies in liquidation, are stayed and could not further be pursued as against those Respondents without leave, but that it is nonetheless lawfully possible for the Applicants to press their claims against the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I do not, therefore, see that as an obstacle either to the making of an order in respect of costs or, for that matter, in respect of the further prosecution by the First and Second Applicants of the case as against the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
