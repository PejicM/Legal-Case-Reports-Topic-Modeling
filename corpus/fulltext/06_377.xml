 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 
 
 1 This matter was in my list for callover today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The matter was called and the appellant did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The matter was previously before the court on 9 November 2005 when the appellant appeared and signed short minutes of order, paragraph 1(a) of which provided that any amended notice of appeal to be filed and served by 9 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">No amended notice of appeal has been filed and served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The appellant has sought to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrate's Court given on 29 October 2005: SZFQV v The Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1405.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The grounds of appeal are unparticularised and assert that:
 
 (a) in making the decision the Tribunal had denied the appellant natural justice and procedural fairness;
 (b) the decision involved ' an error of law ';
 
 (c) the Tribunal ' may appear to be bias [sic] towards the [appellant] ';
 (d) the decision did not take into account the appellant's claim that he was in danger if returned to China;

3 In Coal and Allied Operations Pty Limited v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 ; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at 203-204 [14] Gleeson, CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ said:
 
 
 
 
 
 '... a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that unless there is something to indicate otherwise the power is to be exercised for correction of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">' 


 
4 The appellant has not given any indication as to a reason for his non appearance or his failure to file any amended notice of appeal although no direction was made that he in fact do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Section 25 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') provides that a single judge in my position may make an order that an appeal be dismissed for, inter alia, a failure to comply with a direction of a court or a failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 I am not satisfied that the appellant has failed to comply with any direction in relation to the filing of amended grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The direction made by the registrar was to enable the appellant to do so if he wanted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">However, the appellant has failed to attend today's callover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">There is no explanation for that failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The grounds of appeal reveal no basis upon which I am able to discern how the court might find error in the learned trial judge's decision were an appeal to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 In all the circumstances I am of the opinion that it is an appropriate exercise of power under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Act to order that the appeal be dismissed for the failure of the appellant to attend the callover today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 The Minister seeks fixed costs order in the sum of $450 in respect of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I am of opinion that it is appropriate to make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Associate:
