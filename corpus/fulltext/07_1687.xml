 Introduction 
 
1 Following the combination of national accountancy firm McGrathNicol with the accountancy firm, PPB, three applications have been brought before the Court for the replacement of liquidators, deed administrators and trustees of Creditors' Trusts who were previously associated with PPB and who will not be continuing with the combined entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">For the reasons that follow, I was prepared to make orders on 31 October 2007 giving effect to the proposed replacements following upon the resignations of the previously appointed officers who are not continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">There were associated orders for the notification of creditors and liberty to creditors to apply in relation to those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I did not accept the application for orders that the costs of these applications be in the various administrations to which they relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I gave the plaintiffs liberty to apply to vary the orders made on 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Two minor variations affecting the orders made in WAD178 of 2007 have been proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I have therefore reissued that order with those minor variations and omitted from them the liberty to the plaintiffs to further vary them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 I now publish the reasons for the orders which I made on 31 October 2007 and which, in WAD178 of 2007, are made in slightly varied form today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Application for replacement of liquidators --- WAD177/2007 
 
3 Clifford Stuart Rocke and Jeffery Laurence Herbert in their capacities as liquidators of a company designated only as ACN 080 794 636 Pty Ltd (In Liquidation), (previously known as Downunder Submersible Motors Pty Ltd (hereinafter referred to as DUSM)) and Norman Mel Ashton as liquidator of Keyros Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (Keyros) apply for declarations that they have resigned from their respective offices as liquidators of those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Both companies were a creditors' voluntary winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The plaintiffs seek orders that the vacancies be filled by the appointments in their place of: 
 
 (i) Andrew John Birch and Simon Andrew Read as liquidators of DUSM; 
 (ii) Andrew John Birch as liquidator of Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">


They seek orders that creditors of the two companies be advised by letter within 21 days of the appointment of the new liquidators and that any creditor have liberty to apply within 21 days of receipt of the letter to seek a variation of any orders made pursuant to the originating process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They also seek an order that the costs of the application be costs apportioned equally in the winding up of the two companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Application for replacement of deed administrators and trustees of Creditors' Trusts --- WAD 178/2007 
 
4 By this application a declaration is sought that Clifford Stuart Rocke has resigned as deed administrator from Omegatrend International Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement), Omegatrend Australia Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) and Omegatrend Global Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">A declaration is also sought, pursuant to s 449D of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and, alternatively, s 447A of the Act that any vacancy in the office of deed administrator arising by reason of Mr Rocke's resignation will not be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 A declaration is sought that Norman Mel Ashton has resigned as deed administrator from Kitcher Property Investments Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (Receiver and Manager Appointed), Banwell Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (Receiver and Manager Appointed) and Old Ferry Co Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (Receiver and Manager Appointed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">An order is sought pursuant to s 449D and, alternatively, s 447A of the Act that any vacancy in the office of deed administrator of those companies arising by reason of Mr Ashton's resignation be filled by the appointment of Andrew John Birch to hold office together with Simon Andrew Read who is an existing deed administrator of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Declaratory orders are sought that Norman Mel Ashton, in his capacity as trustee, resign from the KPI Creditors' Trust Deed and the Banwell Creditors' Trust Deed and that Jeffery Laurence Herbert, in his capacity as trustee, resign from the Carr Civil Contracting Pty Ltd Creditors' Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Orders are sought pursuant to s 77 of the Trustees Act 1962 (WA) that the vacancies thus created be filled by the appointment of Andrew John Birch to hold office with Simon Andrew Read, an existing trustee of the relevant creditors' trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 Notification of creditors of the companies and the creditors trusts is also proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The notification would involve letters to all creditors with debts of A$50 or greater, advertisement in national and international newspapers, email copies of the letter to be sent to every person in Malaysia and Singapore in relation to whom the administrators have an email address and placement of the letter on the McGrathNicol website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 Again creditors would be given liberty to apply to the Court within 21 days of receipt of the relevant letter seeking a variation of any orders made pursuant to the originating process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is proposed that costs of the application be apportioned equally in the administration of the companies and the Creditors' Trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Application for replacement of liquidators --- WAD179 of 2007

<sentence id="s51">(2) In particular, and without limiting the generality of the provisions of subsection (1), the Court may make an order appointing a new trustee in substitution for a trustee who ---
 
 (a) desires to be discharged; 
 
 ...
 
 (3) An order under this section, and any consequential vesting order or conveyance, does not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any discharged, former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">

Subsections (4) and (5) are not relevant for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 

 The Creditors' Trust Deeds --- resignation provisions 
 
15 Each of the three Creditors' Trust Deeds which is associated with a Deed of Company Arrangement contains provision for the trustee to resign by giving not less than 30 days prior notice to the creditors and to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In that event the trustee is required to convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of appointing a replacement trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The restructuring behind the applications 
 
16 These applications arise out of a restructuring involving a national accounting firm McGrathNicol and PPB (WA) Pty Ltd which is part of PPB, described by Mr Read in his affidavits as "a national accounting practice that consists of individually owned and operated State practices specialising in corporate insolvency and reconstruction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Associated with the restructuring, Messrs Rocke, Herbert, Ashton and Carson have given notice of their resignations as liquidators, deed administrators and trustees of Creditors' Trusts in connection with the companies mentioned in the applications now before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Where applicable, the resigning liquidators and administrators have provided Mr Read with appropriate Forms 505 for lodgment with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) under the Corporations Regulations 2001 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
17 The sequence of events relevant to the applications, as appears from affidavits filed in support of them and sworn by Mr Read, is: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Simon Read became a partner in PPB (WA) in 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">At that time the PPB practice had not been incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In June 2005, Norman Mel Ashton resigned as a partner of PPB (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">On or about 31 March 2006, Jeffery Laurence Herbert resigned as a partner of PPB(WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">On or about 30 June 2006 Simon Read, Andrew Birch and Clifford Rocke, the three remaining partners of PPB(WA) agreed to incorporate it as PPB(WA) Pty Ltd and become that company's executive directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">On or about 4 July 2007 Andrew Birch and Simon Read and a majority of their staff joined McGrathNicol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On or about 17 July 2007, Clifford Rocke resigned as an executive director of PPB(WA) Pty Ltd and on or about 29 July 2007, informed Mr Read that he had elected not to continue his employment with that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">On or about 30 July 2007 the practice operated by PPB(WA) Pty Ltd ceased and Messrs Read, Birch and a majority of the company's staff joined McGrathNicol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">McGrathNicol does not have any affiliation with any of the other PPB State practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">


As a result of the effective takeover of the PPB practice by McGrathNicol and the staff changes associated with it, Mr Ashton who was liquidator of Keyros and Messrs Herbert and Rocke who were liquidators of DUSM would no longer be involved in the day-to-day management of the administration of those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">18 Messrs Ashton, Herbert and Rocke had also been appointed as deed administrators or trustees of the various companies referred to in application WAD178 of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In an affidavit sworn in that application, Mr Read said that the result of the McGrathNicol and PPB combination and the staff changes meant that those appointees would no longer be involved in the day to day management of the administration of the companies or the creditors' trust deeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">19 Relevantly to application WAD179 of 2007, Ian Menzies Carson is a partner of the PPB(Vic) practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">He, along with Messrs Herbert and Rocke, were Court appointed liquidators of the various companies referred to in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Mr Read contended that the result of the PPB/McGrathNicol combination would be that the previous appointees would no longer be involved in the day-to-day management of the administration of the companies and that it would be necessary to change the appointees in order to finalise the liquidations of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Evidence relevant to the continuity of the administrations following the proposed replacements 
 (i) Application WAD 177 of 2007 --- DUSM and Keyros 
 
20 In each of the applications, according to Mr Read, the proposed replacement appointees were persons involved in and familiar with the work of the various administrations and trusteeships and would be able to provide continuity in relation to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">21 In his affidavit filed in WAD177 of 2007 Mr Read stated his belief that staff with day- to-day knowledge of the status of the external administration for each of DUSM and Keyros would continue to be employed by what he called the "combined entity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The resigning liquidators had conducted detailed file handovers so that continuing staff would have the requisite knowledge in relation to the ongoing conduct of the liquidations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He named two staff members who would continue to be employed by the combined entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">22 Mr Read said it was the practice of his office that once a month a "file review" of every external administration appointment was conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He set out the file review process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">A job controller, the employee responsible for day-to-day management of the relevant external administration, would complete a file review form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The file review form would contain: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Background information on the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">A summary of the key issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">A task list, detailing items requiring action, who was required to take the action and the time by which the action was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Details of work in progress and costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">

The job controller would discuss each individual file review with the manager of the relevant external administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Signed file reviews were provided to the lead appointee or the executive director in charge of the day-to-day control of the external administration for further reviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">23 Mr Read described "leadership meetings" held each week, normally on a Monday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">They are attended by all available managers and at least one executive director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Discussions are often held at these meetings about the progress of individual external administrations and major issues arising from their day-to-day management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The purpose of these meetings is to ensure that the leadership group is kept up to date with all external administrations in the office so that any member of the group would be able to take over the day-to-day running of that administration if required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mr Read himself has regularly attended leadership meetings where the issues and progress of the external administrations of DUSM and Keyros have been discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">24 In relation to DUSM he stated his belief that it would cost approximately $3,000 to conduct a creditors meeting for DUSM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Its liquidation is 75% complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The only remaining tasks for the liquidators are to: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Investigate and potentially pursue an additional preference action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Call a final meeting of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Issue a final dividend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Finalise the liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He stated his belief that Mr Birch and he have sufficient knowledge of the DUSM file to take over from Messrs Rocke and Herbert as its liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">25 Mr Birch, in a separate affidavit sworn in the same matter, dealt specifically with Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He said that the liquidation of Keyros was finalised on or about 23 May 2005 and it was deregistered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However in February 2006 Mr Jared Palandri, a supervisor at the time but no longer employed by his firm, identified assets allegedly hidden by a director of Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Keyros' registration was reinstated on 21 February 2006 and Mr Ashton resumed office as its liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Copies of the relevant Supreme Court orders were annexed to Mr Birch's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">26 Mr Birch said that he was informed by Mr Ashton on or about 7 September 2007 of Mr Ashton's intention to resign as liquidator of Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He was provided with the relevant ASIC form and a written notice of resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">File reviews for Keyros were performed by Mr Palandri and then further reviewed by another staff member, Kirman, and by Mr Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr Birch stated his belief that it would cost approximately $3,000 to conduct a creditors' meeting for Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The remaining tasks for the Keyros liquidators are to investigate and potentially pursue actions against the former director, call a final meeting of creditors, issue a final dividend (if funds permit) and finalise the liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Birch stated his belief that he has sufficient knowledge of the Keyros file to replace Mr Aston as its liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He has consented to act as liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">(ii) Application WAD178 of 2007 --- Deeds of Company Arrangement and Creditors' Trusts 
 
27 In application WAD178 of 2007, Mr Read swore an affidavit which identified staff members continuing with the "combined entity" who had day-to-day knowledge of the status of the external administrations for each of the companies the subject of the application in WAD178 of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Each of these is a company subject to a deed of company arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In addition, there are three Creditors' Trusts for which Messrs Herbert, Ashton and Read are trustees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">28 Mr Read identified Mr Kirman, Ms Breadmore, Mr Rew and Ms Stirling as staff members familiar with these administrations who would continue to be employed by the combined entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He described again the file review and leadership meeting process referred to in his affidavit in proceedings WAD177 of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">29 At least one of Messrs Ashton, Herbert and Rocke was appointed as deed administrator or trustee of the various companies and creditors' trust deeds the subject of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In relation to companies in which Mr Rocke was deed administrator, Mr Read had been provided with Mr Rocke's written notice of resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">File reviews for those companies were performed by Mr Abberton, a senior analyst then, but no longer employed by Mr Read's firm, who acted as the job controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">These were further reviewed by Messrs Kirman and Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Read believes that due to the large number of creditors spread both nationally and internationally it would cost approximately $16,000 to conduct a creditors' meeting for the companies affected by Mr Rocke's resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He stated his belief that the administration of the deed funds of the three Omegatrend companies, was 90% complete and did not require the appointment of a further deed administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">30 Mr Read referred to the companies in respect of which Mr Ashton was a deed administrator, they being Kitcher Property Investments Pty Ltd, Banwell Pty Ltd and Old Ferry Co Pty Ltd (the Ashton companies).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Mr Ashton was also a trustee of the KPI Creditors' Trust and the Banwell Creditors' Trust (the Ashton trusts).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Mr Read and Mr Ashton had been appointed deed administrators of the Ashton companies on 22 November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Mr Ashton informed Mr Read of his intention to resign as deed administrator of the Ashton companies on or about 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">File reviews for the Ashton companies were performed by Ms Breadmore who acted as job controller and were further reviewed by Messrs Kirman, Birch and himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Administration of the deed funds of the Ashton companies is 80% complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It would cost approximately $11,500 for the Ashton companies to conduct creditors' meetings to approve the resignation of Mr Ashton and the appointment of Mr Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Mr Read believes that Mr Birch has sufficient knowledge of the files of the Ashton companies to replace Mr Ashton as their deed administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">31 A similar position is said to exist in relation to the Ashton trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Mr Read believes that it would take approximately 30 days and cost a total of about $8,000 for the Ashton trusts to conduct creditors' meetings in order to approve the resignation of Mr Ashton and the appointment of Mr Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Again he stated his belief that Mr Birch had sufficient knowledge of the files of the Ashton trusts to replace Mr Ashton as their trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">32 Mr Read referred to the Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust of which he and Mr Herbert were appointed trustees in or about April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The file reviews for that trust were performed by Ms Stirling who acted as job controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">They were further reviewed by Messrs Kirman, Birch and himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He stated his belief that the administration of the trust fund of the Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust was 75% complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It would take about 30 days and cost about $4,000 to conduct a creditors' meeting to approve the resignation of Mr Ashton and the appointment of Mr Birch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">(iii) Application WAD179 of 2007 --- Westpoint companies and Pasticceria Australia Pty Ltd 
 
33 Mr Read gave similar evidence in relation to the various companies referred to in application WAD179 of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">All but one of the companies the subject of this application are related to Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (In Liquidation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The company not so related is Pasticceria Australia Pty Ltd (In liquidation) (Pasticceria).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In each case the liquidator was Court appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Mr Read said that the liquidations of the companies to which Mr Rocke had been appointed as liquidator were smaller and less complex than those to which Mr Herbert had been appointed and would not require the joint and several appointment of three liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">He believed that Mr Birch had sufficient knowledge of the files of the companies to which Mr Rocke had been appointed to replace Messrs Rocke and Carson as their liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">He also believed that Mr Birch had sufficient knowledge of the files relating to the companies of which Mr Herbert had been a liquidator to replace him in that office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Submissions in support of the applications 
 
34 In support of the application in WAD177 of 2007 it was said that the practical effect of the orders proposed would be that Messrs Rocke and Herbert would be removed in their capacity as liquidators of DUSM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I interpolate that the removal would be affected as a consequence of their tendering their resignations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">As Barrett J set out in Re Application of Vouris (2004) 49 ACSR 543 the Act is silent on the effect of the resignation of one of several jointly appointed liquidators in a voluntary winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Messrs Read and Birch would fill the vacancies in the office of liquidator arising by reason of the resignations of Messrs Rocke and Herbert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Mr Ashton would be removed in his capacity as liquidator of Keyros and Mr Birch would fill the resulting vacancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The costs of the application, if the orders sought were made, would be apportioned equally between DUSM and Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">35 It was submitted that pursuant to s 502 of the Act the Court may fill a vacancy in the office of a liquidator where such a vacancy exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Reference was made to the judgment of Barrett J in Re McGrath and Anor (as liqs of HIH Insurance Ltd (in liq)) (2005) 54 ACSR 55 in which it was held that the Court can make a prospective order appointing a liquidator contingent upon a vacancy being created by the liquidator's resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Re Application of Vouris (2004) 49 ACSR 543 was also cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">36 It was submitted that the Court may consider an application in groups according to the source and nature of the appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The plaintiffs submitted that each appointment of liquidators to the companies should be grouped according to the nature of the liquidator or liquidators' appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">37 In relation to DUSM it was submitted that under s 499(5) of the Act a liquidator has the power to resign subject to lodging a Form 505 with ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Messrs Rocke and Herbert had been appointed as liquidators of DUSM and had provided Forms 505.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">A similar position applied in relation to Mr Ashton as liquidator of Keyros.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">38 On the question of the costs of the application, the plaintiffs submitted that the costs incurred in bringing it were properly incurred in winding up the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The liquidators of the companies, it was submitted, should be indemnified from the assets of the companies for the costs incurred in bringing the application on their behalf: In the matter of The Bonang Gold Mining Company, Limited (1893) 14 LR (NSW) Eq 262 and Re Mendarma Pty Ltd (In liq) (No 2) (2007) 61 ACSR 601.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">39 Similar submissions were made in relation to the replacement of the deed administrators and trustees sought in WAD178 of 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It was pointed out that the practical effect of the orders sought would be that Mr Rocke would be removed in his capacity as deed administrator of the Omegatrend companies and that vacancy would not be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Mr Ashton would be removed in his capacity as deed administrator of the companies to which he had been appointed and Mr Birch would fill the vacancy in the office of a joint and several deed administrator arising by reason of Mr Ashton's resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He would hold office together with Mr Read who would continue as deed administrator of those companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Mr Herbert would be removed in his capacity as trustee of the Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust and his vacancy would be filled by Mr Birch who would hold office with Mr Read who would continue as a trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Ashton would be removed in his capacity as trustee from the trusts for which he was trustee and his vacancy would be filled by Mr Birch who would hold office with Mr Read continuing as a trustee of those trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">40 Reference was made to s 449D of the Act and the decision of Barrett J in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 that the Court can make a prospective order appointing a deed administrator contingent upon a vacancy being created by the resignation of a deed administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Reference was made also to s 447A as providing the Court with a very wide power to make such order as it thinks appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Barrett J considered that the powers conferred on the Court by s 447A of the Act were wide enough to give the Court power to appoint a joint and several deed administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">41 In relation to the Creditors' Trusts reliance was placed on s 77 of the Trustees Act and s 93 of that Act under which an existing or incumbent trustee could bring to Court an application under s 77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">42 In relation to the resignation of Mr Rocke as a joint and several deed administrator, reference was made to the difficulty identified by Barrett J in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 where a joint and several liquidator resigns or dies leaving only one of the joint and several liquidators remaining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Barrett J, it was said, held that two options were available to the Court in those situations: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Appoint a second liquidator jointly and severally to fill the vacancy; or 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Remove the remaining jointly and severally appointed liquidator and then appoint the previously remaining liquidator as a sole liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">
 

43 It was said that in the case of a deed of administration the difficulties identified in Re Application of Vouris 49 ACSR 543 would not arise where two or more deed administrators remained jointly and severally appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The plaintiffs submitted that Birch and Read remained jointly and severally appointed deed administrators of the companies from which Mr Rocke had offered his resignation so that no vacancy in the office of a joint and several deed administrator arose by reason of that resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">44 It was said that the proposed orders both in respect of the deeds of administration and the creditors' trusts would not prejudice creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Notification and the liberty to apply would give any objecting creditor an opportunity to approach the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">45 Again, it was submitted that pursuant to s 443 of the Act a deed administrator had priority to recover costs and expenses properly incurred from company assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Section 71 of the Trustees Act provided a trustee with the ability to recover costs and expenses properly incurred from trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The plaintiffs submitted that the costs incurred in bringing the application were properly incurred in the administration of the deeds and the Creditors' Trusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">On that basis the deed administrators and trustees should be indemnified from the assets of the companies for the costs incurred in bringing this application on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It was submitted that the costs be apportioned equally between the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">46 In application WAD 179 of 2007 relating to the replacement of the liquidators, similar submissions were made and it is not necessary to revisit them here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A note on the Creditors' Trusts 
 
47 "Creditors' Trusts" have been explained in a regulatory guide issued by the ASIC in May 2005 thus: 
 
 
 1.1 A creditors' trust in a [Deed of Company Arrangement] DCA is a mechanism used to accelerate a company's exit from external administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">To date, it has been used most commonly (but not exclusively) in connection with the rehabilitation of public companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX).</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">In some cases, this leads to a 'backdoor' listing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">1.2 Typically, under the terms of the DCA and one or more interconnected deeds, a trust entity is created and the company's obligations to some or all of the creditors bound by the DCA are compromised and transferred to the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Those creditors become beneficiaries of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Occasionally, there may be separate creditors' trusts for employee and non-employee creditors, or for secured and unsecured creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">1.3 The company and/or third parties promise to make one or more payments (or transfer other property) to the trustee in satisfaction of the creditors' claims against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In return, the creditors' rights against the company are extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">1.4 The trustee of the new trust becomes solely responsible to the former creditors (now beneficiaries) for: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ensuring that the company and/or other third parties perform their payment and other obligations to the trustee; 
 
 (b) determining how much each of the former creditors is entitled to receive from the trust; and 
 
 (c) in due course, making any distribution to those former creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
 
 

48 The ASIC guideline notes that it is usual for the deed of company arrangement to be effectuated and to terminate after creditors' claims against the company have been removed in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">When the deed of company arrangement terminates, the company ceases to be externally administered, the directors regain full control and it is no longer required to use the endorsement "subject to deed of company arrangement" on its public documents: see s 450E(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The relevant ASIC guideline is entitled 'External administration: Deeds of company arrangement involving a creditors' trust A Guide for registered liquidators appointed under Part 5.3A '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The guide is numbered Regulatory Guide 82 and was published in May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The regulatory guide is quoted as an explanation of the creditors' trust in Ford's Principles of Corporations Law , (Butterworths) Part VII Chapter 26 at [26.200].</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Creditors' trusts have been helpfully discussed in Heaver-Wren T, "DOCA Termination through Creditors' Trust Deeds" (2004) 12 Insolv LJ 117-120; see also McKenzie R, "Creditors' Trusts and the ASIC Guidelines" (2005) 17(3) Australian Insolvency Journal 4-6; Proudman D, "Some Issues Surrounding Creditors' Trust Deeds Parts 1 and 2 " (2005) 6 INSLB 1-5 and 31-34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The mechanism has been touched on in the Supreme Court decisions: Ian Charles Francis and Michael Patrick Joseph Ryan as Trustees of The West Australian Shed Commercial Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed and West Australian Shed Co Pty Ltd Creditors Trust Deed [2003] WASC 39 (Pullin J); Open Telecommunications Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2003] NSWSC 1198 (Hamilton J) and Rupert Co v Chameleon Mining (2006) 24 ACLC 635 (Austin J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">49 The West Australian Shed Co case involved an application to vary the terms of a creditors' trust deed to allow for payment of a single lump sum to the trust in lieu of a requirement that 50% of the net profit generated by the companies in two successive financial years be paid in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The variation was there approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">50 In Open Telecommunications Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2003] NSWSC 1198 a deed administrator applied to Hamilton J for directions under s 447D of the Act that he would be justified in executing and giving effect to a varied deed of company arrangement and a proposed creditors' trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In discussing the creditors' trust deed, Hamilton J observed (at [4]): 
 
 The mechanism proposed by the deed administrator is quite ingenious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is for the adoption of an amended DCA coupled with a creditors' trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">This would remove the sums promised to creditors from the ambit of the DCA to the ambit of a deed of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">When this is done, the DCA could be discharged; the company would no longer be subject to a DCA; and it is likely that it could be restored to the Stock Exchange board and the contemplated additional capital sums raised, both to feed the promised amounts into a scheme for the creditors and to restore the company to viability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Although this would take the management of the money outside the ambit of the CA, it would be held and supervised in the creditors' interests according to the general law of trusts and their position would be thus protected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Even disputes as to entitlement, if they arose, would have a mechanism for their resolution through the provisions of s 63 of the Trustee Act 1925 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">

His Honour held in that case that there could be no objection on the ground of legality or propriety to the course that the administrator proposed to follow and gave directions accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The arrangement was, of course, subject to approval by the creditors for its implementation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">51 In Rupert Co 24 ACLC 635, Austin J terminated a winding up of a company under s 482 of the Act having regard to the effect of a deed of company arrangement and creditors' trust which left the company with no significant body of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">As a result of those arrangements, it was solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The liquidator had advertised for creditors to lodge their claims against the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Describing the effect of the deed of company arrangement and the creditors' trust his Honour said (at [18]):
 
 ... the effect of the DOCA and the Creditors' Trust is to transfer the creditors' claims to the Trust and release the company from liability to pay those debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">

He observed that the arrangements appeared to conform to the ASIC guidelines of May 2005 and that ASIC did not oppose the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">52 The three creditors' trusts affected by the proposed orders are the KPI Creditors' Trust, the Banwell Creditors' Trust and the Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">53 The terms of the KPI Creditors' Trust are found in an amended Creditors' Trust Deed which was executed in December 2003 and took effect upon the termination of an amended varied deed of company arrangement executed by the company and the administrators on the execution date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The trust assets comprised the company's assets, a fund and the sum of $10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The fund was to be formed from the proceeds of realisation of the company's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Those assets were all of the company's assets or property and all of the assets or property of the KPI Tri Unit Trust and the KPI Trust No 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Relevantly, cl 6 provided: 
 
 
 6.1 The Trustees shall consider the Claims of each of the Creditors for the purpose of determining the Creditors' Entitlements under this Trust Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">6.2 For the purposes of determining the Entitlements, to the extent that those Entitlements have not been determined under the Amended Varied DOCA, regulations 5.6.39 to 5.6.72 of the Corporations Regulations shall apply to this Trust Deed and to the Trustees as if the reference to the liquidator were references to the Trustees and references to winding up were references to this Trust Deed and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to this Trust Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">6.3 Subdivision A to E of Division 6 of Part 5.6 of the Corporations Act apply to the admission of Claims and payment of Entitlements under this Trust Deed as if the references to winding-up were references to this Trust Deed and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to this Trust Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">
 

54 Clause 8 which governed the distribution of the Fund provided, inter alia, that the trustees were to pay from the Fund in priority following the administrators and trustees' remuneration: 
 
 ... Creditors who would, if the Company were in liquidation, be entitled to a priority under section 556 of the Corporations Act , to the extent necessary to satisfy their Claims in full; ...
 

Thereafter the trustees were required to pay what was called the 'Kitcher Payment' if it had not already been paid pursuant to the provisions of the Amended Varied DOCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The Kitcher Payment meant the payment of the sum of $300,000 (or the assignment or transfer of an equivalent value of the company's assets) from the company's assets or the Fund by the company (by the Administrators) to the director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">55 These provisions are mentioned to show the close relationship between the amended varied DOCA and the KPI Creditors' Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">56 Similar provisions were found in the Banwell Creditors' Trust Deed which had a similar relationship to a deed of company arrangement executed by Banwell Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) and the Banwell administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">57 The Carr Civil Contracting Creditors' Trust had similar terms and a similar relationship to a deed of company arrangement executed by Carr Civil Contracting Pty Ltd (Administrators appointed) pursuant to a resolution of creditors on 5 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Whether the orders sought should be made 
 
58 In my opinion orders giving effect to the proposed replacements of the various liquidators, administrators and trustees can and should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">In relation to the application under the Trustees Act I regard that application as falling within the accrued jurisdiction of the Court by reason of the close connection between the Creditors' Trusts and the Deeds of Company Arrangement to which they related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The replacement of the trustees arises out of the same set of events as has given rise to the application for the appointment of new liquidators and deed administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Although the term "the Court" in s 77 of the Trustees Act is defined as the Supreme Court of Western Australia, this Court may exercise the jurisdiction as part of its federal jurisdiction in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">59 I do not consider it necessary to make the various declarations of vacancy which were sought in the originating applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Moreover, in my opinion, the text of the letters proposed to be sent to the creditors should not be framed so as to give the appearance that any of the liquidators, administrators or trustees has been removed by order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">60 So far as the costs are concerned, I have had regard to the submissions of the plaintiffs that they should be treated as costs in the liquidations, deed administrations and trusteeships affected by these orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It was submitted that the reorganisation should be regarded as an incident of the administrations and should, in effect, be part of their overhead costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">I do not accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In my opinion it is quite inappropriate that costs flowing from a voluntary restructuring of the firm whose members have assumed these various offices should effectively be visited upon creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">I can see no reasonable basis upon which the orders sought could properly be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The costs orders will be refused and I will make orders to make it clear that these costs are not recoverable out of the assets of the companies or trusts affected by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
