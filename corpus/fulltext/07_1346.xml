<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 2 August 2007, I gave oral reasons in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I ordered that the first respondent, Mr Thomas, bring in short minutes on 6 August 2007 to reflect the views I expressed in my reasons of that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I provided a draft of these orders in [89] of my reasons, as follows:
 
 1. that the further amended application be dismissed: 
 2. the applicants pay the costs of the respondents; 
 3. on the cross-claim there be a declaration as sought in order 1, and an order in terms of order 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I would hear the parties, if it is still pressed, on the order sought in paragraph 3 of the cross-claim; 
 5. the cross-respondents, that is the McGurk interests, pay the costs of the cross-claimant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 

2 On 6 August 2007, Mr Newlinds, senior counsel for the applicants, persuaded me not to make final orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He foreshadowed an application, to be made when the settled reasons for judgment were available, that I permit the proceeding to be re-opened and that I change my view as to how I should deal with the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 On 15 August 2007, I heard a notice of motion filed in court brought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In short, I permitted the re-opening of the proceeding because I had overlooked the fact that I had expressly left costs to one side at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In my reasons published on 2 August 2007, I expressed a view about who should pay the costs, and I expressed a view as to how the question of costs could be dealt with to protect the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The application to re-open to revisit the question of the applicants paying the costs was clearly legitimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I had overlooked the hiving-off of this issue in preparing my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Thus, on 15 August 2007, I received evidence and heard the parties on this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 The applicants also contended that I should permit a re-opening to revisit the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It was said that the question of costs had been pivotal to the foreshadowed exercise of discretion not to set aside the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To an extent that was correct, though the way I proposed to protect the creditors from costs did not depend upon the particular order for costs that I made against the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Nevertheless, having overlooked the question of costs, I took the view that there should be no residual basis for a litigant to consider that it or he had not had its or his submissions considered fully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Subject to the comments I make later, the parties had undertaken the hearing in the second half of July with some real despatch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">I sought to give them an expeditious result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In so doing, I overlooked an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 After the evidence on the motion to re-open was led, I came to the view that I should permit the matter to be re-opened, not merely in relation to the costs order against the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">One of the most compelling reasons for taking this course was the further elaboration of the position of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It was evident from my reasons of 2 August 2007 (distributed in settled form on 13 August 2007) that I was not prepared to set the composition aside with the existing amended offer of $685,000 from the McGurk interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">One aspect of my reluctance was the lack of clarity in how the matter would or might unfold in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Another aspect was my reluctance to interfere with the decision of the creditors, even in circumstances where they had not been served as well as they were entitled to expect they would be by Mr Thomas on and leading up to 11 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">This was partly due to a preference (that was less than fully expressed in my reasons) for caution in setting aside the acts of creditors under these provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It was also partly due to the difficulty of comparing the position of all creditors under the Naylors' composition with the position of creditors of the respective estates under the applicants' offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Also, assuming I set the composition aside, the likely additional costs of further meetings, in the light only of the existing offers may well have left the creditors worse off, especially if there were further to-ing and fro-ing involving arguments about the operation of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
7 Perhaps because of these considerations, at the argument concerning re-opening, Mr Newlinds put forward another "offer" from the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This was reduced to a written undertaking to the Court in terms annexed to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Based on figures provided by Mr Thomas to the applicants' solicitors, the undertaking had the intention of bringing about a payment of 100 cents in the dollar to all creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">8 This undertaking so radically changed the landscape that I took the view that I should re-open the consideration of the exercise of the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">9 Having made that decision, I gave the Naylors, through Mr Friedlander, an opportunity to put submissions as to why I should not set aside the composition in the light of the terms of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I also gave them the opportunity of calling further evidence in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">No further evidence was called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In particular, no evidence of the willingness of any particular financier to lend additional funds to the Naylors to match the effect of the offer contained in the undertaking which is annexed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mr Friedlander did say that should the composition be set aside his clients wanted the opportunity to bring forward a competing proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">10 In his submissions, Mr Friedlander, whilst accepting it was within the power of the Court to set aside the composition, stressed the caution that the Court should exercise in acting under s 222 or s 222C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I agree with that approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As I said in my earlier reasons, the Parliament intended that unnecessary applications to the Court be eliminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It should not be easy for third parties (as the applicants effectively are) to interfere with the decisions of creditors affecting the lives of bankrupts when the rights and responsibilities of each are mediated through a skilled, experienced professional appointed by, and responsible to, the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">11 Notwithstanding these considerations, I have come to the view that I should set aside the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I have come to this view for a number of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">First, it cannot now be disputed that the offer by the applicants reflected in the undertaking is one which benefits all creditors necessarily at a level above the Naylors' composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">On calculations provided by the trustee, the sum of $773,769.54 will provide 100 cents in the dollar to all creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Secondly, in the circumstances I have found, the trustee failed in May 2007 in the exercise of his duties to the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">They were left with what is now clearly an inferior result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That was not plain after the July hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is plain now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Thirdly, the Naylors say that they can improve on their earlier offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Thus, it is clear that those who are interested in the property should now finalise their positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The applicants have submitted themselves to an undertaking to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">With the creditors now substantially protected by that undertaking, by the costs orders of the kind that I will make and by any further necessary orders, I do not see why the creditors should not be given 100 cents in the dollar rather than receiving a lesser sum under the Naylors' earlier proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">12 In coming to this view, I have not ignored the position of the Naylors and their attachment to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Any cropping or work done on the land since May 2007 should be protected and can be by the timing of relinquishment of possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The primary concern should be, however, the creditors of their former bankruptcies, whom they have not paid and who remain unpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 That said, it would not be fair on the Naylors, or appropriate in the circumstances, to make orders that require the sale to the applicants under the new offer, without giving them an opportunity to match it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The creditors should decide this question, not the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Other machinery and protective orders should also be made, which I set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">14 That leaves the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">A spirited debate took place on 15 August 2007 as to what I should do about costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The applicants submitted, with some justification, that Mr Thomas and those running the case for him were less than forthcoming in the provision of information, both documentary and evidentiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Mr Thomas submitted that the calls for documents in the notice to produce issued by the applicants were, if not oppressive, at least over-reaching and, when the file was called for expressly, it was handed over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Thomas' explanation, through his counsel, as to why the reality of his evidence and that of Mr Fagan was not frankly and fully disclosed without the need for cross-examination was less than persuasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In fairness to Mr Thomas, he was being assailed litigiously by the applicants, aspects of which (such as the misleading or deceptive conduct claim and the claim for damages) impugned his position personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">15 I do think, however, that both sides lost sight of the proper way to run litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The courts are a scarce and expensive public resource.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Litigation is necessarily expensive for the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It involves skilled, experienced members of a profession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The professionals and their clients have a duty not to call upon court resources to resolve matters other than truly in dispute: Ashmore v Corporation of Lloyds [1992] 1 WLR 446 at 453.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This duty, which the courts can enforce, reaches down to the method or conduct of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Issues should be examined realistically and cases should be run with a minimum (not a maximum) of discovery and interlocutory skirmishing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Parties should be frank with each other in order that the real issues are litigated without confusion or surprise: see in particular Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Limited [2001] NSWCA 346 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 116 at 117[1], 128 [28], and 131 [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">16 One aspect of this approach is the sensible and reasonable provision of documents and information, reasonably requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This is said to limit, not expand, discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Sometimes a reasonable request for informal inspection or for the provision of information and a reasonable and prompt response can save much greater expense and trouble later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Here, instead of asking for access to the file, a long and repetitive notice to produce was issued which would have required a significant body of (wasted) time and expense to answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">That said, access to the file was not offered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Further, and more importantly, a frank disclosure of the likely evidence of Mr Thomas and Mr Fagan was not made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Had it been, considerable time and money would have been saved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">These combative and defensive postures led to claims before me for discovery by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I dealt with these at an extended directions hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Some of the asserted claims for documents were unnecessary and such as to be described in former times as "mere fishing", now perhaps better described as unreasonable or inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The above comments reflect a change in approach as to the former perceived "right" to discovery and the modern approach, reflected in this Court by the Federal Court Rules and Practice Note 14, that any and all discovery must be justified and is in the control of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It is fair to say that a prompt offer of the trustee's file and of a full explanation of the events leading up to and on 11 May 2007 would have forestalled a lot of the time-consuming and wasteful correspondence and disputation and may well have limited the case considerably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">17 It should not be thought that I have forgotten the difficulties of practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is easy to be wise after the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Practitioners and clients must, however, approach civil litigation (even hard fought commercial litigation) with the recognition of the need for civility and reasonableness so as to avoid unnecessary time and energy being expended (at cost to the client) in dealing with incivility and unreasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The professionals here were civil to each other; but their positions were sometimes unnecessarily intransigent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">There is a balance to be struck between reasonable informality to cut through procedures and resistance to unnecessary demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">That balance is one for practitioners whose fees represent their skill and experience, including their skill in identifying the real issues for trial and bringing them to trial efficiently, in a cost-effective way and with a minimum of unnecessary activity and expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">18 I think both sides approached the preparation of this litigation with an eye to raising every issue, demanding every document and restricting every incursion, without calmly and reasonably accommodating each other in an attempt to minimise the costs of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">That, I think, is what led to the failure of the first respondent and those advising him to lay out clearly and frankly what his and Mr Fagan's evidence was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">19 Though the applicants have been successful in their attempt to set aside the composition, that success is a result of the effect of the latest offer that they have put forward and not a result of persuading me of any substantive error in my approach to the matter on the material put before me in July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The applicants also failed in a considerable number of issues; indeed, as I have just indicated, substantially all issues as run in the July hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">20 That said, if the first respondent had been forthcoming in these proceedings (arguably it was not relevant in the caveat proceedings that he initiated) about his conduct of 11 May 2007 and Mr Fagan's conduct earlier, these proceedings would, in all probability, have been less protracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">21 Weighing up these considerations and taking into account the evidence led and submissions made on 15 August 2007, I think that the appropriate order for costs should be that the applicants pay 70% of the costs of the first respondent up to and including 15 August 2007 on a party/party basis, 70% of the Naylor's costs up to the same time on the same basis, the first respondent pay 30% of the Naylor's costs up to the same time on the same basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The parties should pay their own costs from 15 August 2007 to today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">22 Subject to any argument as to their precise form, the orders of the Court will be as follows:
 The Court: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Declares that the first respondent has validly rescinded the contract for the sale entered into in April 2007 between the first applicant and the first respondent of Certificate of Title Folio Identifiers 1/137459, 1/137460, 1/111408, 3/111408, 164/750357, 165/750357, 166/750357, 171/750357, 173/750357, 179/50357, 183/750357, 184/750357, Auto Consol 11846-232, Auto Consol 8100-243, Auto Consol 5574-195 and Auto Consol 1222-122.</sentence>

(iii) the first respondent pay 30% of the Naylors' costs up to the same time on the same basis; and

<sentence id="s114">(g) Orders that the first respondent will not, without the leave of the Court, seek to recover, either as part of his costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the estates of the second and third respondents or as part of his costs, charges and expenses of the composition entered on 11 May 2007 or of the trust created hereunder any costs, charges and expenses occasioned by these proceedings and the Supreme Court proceedings up to and including 29 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">(h) Orders that the costs of the steps required to be undertaken by the first respondent henceforth, including the costs of the meeting referred to at (b) above, be determined by the Court after the sale of the property, such determination being as to amount and who is to pay.</sentence>

<sentence id="s132">Second Schedule
 
Land to be sold at Hen and Chicken Lane/Vale Road, Perthville, being the land contained in Folio Identifiers, 31/1100620, 1/137459, 1/137460, 1/111408, 3/111408, 164/750357, 165/750357, 166/750357, 171/750357, 173/750357, 179/750357, 183/750357, 184/750357, Auto Consol 11846-232, Auto Consol 8100-243, Auto Consol 5574-195 and Auto Consol 1222-112.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">23 The following comments should be made about some of these orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">(a) First, order 3(a) above sets the composition aside under s 222 of the Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">There is no evidence of any intervening acts of third parties that need to be protected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I will hear the parties on whether I should substitute the order to set aside with an order to terminate under s 222C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">(b) Secondly, order 3(h) above is made because it is unclear from the undertaking whether the applicants would bear these costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Mr Newlinds (as I understood him) indicated that they would.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I am not clear why they should under the terms of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It may be that the applicants wish the position to be clear that they pay those costs since the costs may differentially affect the position of the creditors should the purchase be pursuant to the undertaking compared to some offer from the Naylors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">If I have misunderstood the position, I will hear the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">(c) Thirdly, if the Naylors are unsuccessful in winning the property, they should be reasonably protected in terms of occupation to harvest any winter crops and sell any livestock and plant and machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That is only reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">However, it will also be necessary for them, in these circumstances, to appreciate the necessity for reasonable despatch in respect of such matters and for reasonable despatch in giving vacant possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Reasonable and enforceable arrangements for vacant possession may (subject to hearing the parties) be the price for extended possession, if the Naylors fail to win the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">(d) Fourthly, the parties should make use of any liberty to restore the matter if they think it appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I do, however, expect co-operation between the parties in the manner I have identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">(e) Fifthly, the three weeks for the Naylors to put forward a proposal is more than reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It is intended that the time prescribed be of the essence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">I have nit been assisted by evidence from the Naylors since July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">There was no suggestion by Mr Friedlander that this was a time frame that was too short.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">(f) Sixthly, I considered ordering only one meeting in order 3(c)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">However, on reflection, there should be three meetings as if the bankrupts estates were meeting again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Given that the intent is to replicate as far as possible the events of 11 May 2007, and given that the holding of the property on trust for the creditors should as far as possible reflect the creditors' rights in the bankruptcies and the various estates, 3 meetings should be held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">If some deadlock arises from this course the parties should have the matter relisted for resolution of any difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">24 I will give the parties an opportunity to address me on the form of these orders on Friday, 31 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Allsop.</sentence>
