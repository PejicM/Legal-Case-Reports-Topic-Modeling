 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">INTRODUCTION 
 These proceedings concern BHPB and three of its subsidiaries --- Finance, BHPDRI and BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Finance, the internal financier to the BHPB Group, financed projects approved by the board of directors of BHPB both initially and on an on-going basis, including projects constructed and operated by BHPDRI and BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In the 2000 year, two projects partly financed by Finance --- the HBI plant for which BHPDRI was responsible and the Beenup Project for which BHPTM was responsible --- had not been successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Finance wrote off as bad part of the debt owed by BHPDRI and part of the debt owed by BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The amounts written off by Finance in the 2000 year were: $1,845,833,281.34, of a total debt of $2,191,833,281, due to it by BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">(There is a discrepancy of $0.34 which may be put to one side); and $310,881,702.40, of a total debt of $339,216,146.22, due to it by BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is the writing off by Finance of these parts of the two debts (the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan) in the 2000 year which is in issue in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Two consequential steps for tax purposes were taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">First, Finance claimed as a deduction the amount written off pursuant to s 25-35 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Secondly, BHPB applied the debt forgiveness provisions to those write offs (Div 245 in Schedule 2C of the 1936 Act) but not the provisions concerning limited recourse debt in Div 243 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">ISSUES AND SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS 
 The writing off of part of each debt raises five issues: whether Finance was entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b) of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The central question is whether Finance was in the business of lending money and, if so, whether each loan was made by Finance in the course of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In relation to the BHPTM loan, there is a further issue about whether the loan was bad; alternatively to (1), whether Finance was entitled: 
(a) pursuant to s 8-1 of the 1997 Act, to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad;
 
(b) pursuant to s 25-35(1)(a) of the 1997 Act, to an allowable deduction of $424,204,013 in respect of the BHPDRI loan and $95,892,428 in respect of the BHPTM loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">These amounts related to interest which accrued under the loans and which had previously been included in Finance's assessable income;
 if yes to (1) or (2) in relation to that part of the BHPTM loan written off as bad, whether the Commissioner made a valid determination pursuant to Pt IVA of the 1936 Act to cancel that bad debt deduction claimed by Finance; in the BHPB Proceedings, whether Div 243 and Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act apply to disallow capital allowance deductions claimed by BHPB as head entity of a tax consolidated group in respect of assets of BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The central question is whether the BHPDRI loan was limited recourse debt for the purposes of Div 243; finally, if BHPB and Finance were unsuccessful in whole or in part in these proceedings, the question of the additional tax imposed by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">For the detailed reasons that follow, I consider that: Finance was entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each part of the debt written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b) in the 2000 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Finance was in the business of lending money and each loan was made by Finance in the course of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Moreover, contrary to the Commissioner's submissions, the amount of the BHPTM loan written off was bad; although these questions do not arise for consideration, nevertheless: 
(a) pursuant to s 8-1 of the 1997 Act, Finance would have been entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad;
 
(b) s 25-35(1)(a) of the 1997 Act was not engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">There was no interest written off as bad;
 in relation to the BHPTM loan written off as bad, the Commissioner was entitled to rely upon s 169A(3) of the 1936 Act in making his s 177F(1)(b) determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, Pt IVA did not apply to otherwise disallow the allowable deduction in respect of the amount of the BHPTM loan written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b); in the BHPB Proceedings, Div 243 and Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act did not apply to disallow capital allowance deductions claimed by BHPB as head entity of a tax consolidated group in respect of assets of BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The BHPDRI loan was not limited recourse debt for the purposes of Div 243; in light of my earlier findings, the question of additional tax does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">However, if I am wrong in any of the conclusions I have reached, I would have remitted a substantial part of the additional tax imposed by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The position adopted by BHPB and Finance was reasonably arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">C. FACTS 
 The facts relevant to the BHPB Group and the manner in which the group was managed are primarily sourced from the affidavits sworn by Mr Graeme McGregor, a former director of both BHPB and Finance and Mr Basil Ahyick, who was appointed in August 1994 as Finance's "Supervisor Accounting", appointed in January 1996 as "Financial Accountant [BHPB] Finance and Investments" and then appointed in January 1998 as "Team Leader SAP R/3 Project, [BHPB] Budgets and Accounting".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Their evidence in relation to these matters was not the subject of challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">(a) The BHPB Group
 BHPB was incorporated in 1885 and is the ultimate parent company of a diversified group of multinational natural resource companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In the 1990's, the period with which these proceedings are primarily concerned, the BHPB Group's principal areas of business were: the minerals group which undertook minerals exploration, production and processing principally of coal, copper, iron ore and manganese ore; the petroleum group which undertook hydrocarbon exploration, production and refining; and the steel group which undertook steel production and group corporate services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The BHPB Group's corporate services group provided transactional services to other members of the BHPB Group including in the areas of finance, treasury and accounting, human resources and supply and procurement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Finance, the applicant in VID 788 of 2006, formed part of the treasury section of the corporate services group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">(b) Finance
 Finance was incorporated on 29 August 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of BHPB "for the purpose of borrowing funds to re-lend to Group companies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Its Memorandum of Association records one of its objects is "to carry on the business of financier in all its branches both within and outside Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">From September 1985, Finance was registered as a financial institution and a short term money market dealer / operator for the purposes of the Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982 (Vic) and s 98I of the Stamp Duties Act 1920 (NSW) [repealed by the State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2008 (NSW)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">By the early 1980's, Finance had commenced raising finance from external lenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">From the early 1990's, virtually all external borrowings of the BHPB Group to fund activities and projects of the BHPB Group were undertaken by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Centralisation of the financing activities of the BHPB Group within Finance provided, what were described as, numerous "administrative and corporate efficiencies" including ensuring that lenders and financiers dealt with one entity whose business could be readily understood by the finance community, centralisation of the foreign exchange operations of the BHPB Group for better monitoring and control of the group's total foreign exchange exposure and hedging activities (with foreign exchange gains and losses being treated on revenue account) and enhanced transparency of the BHPB Group's financial results by separating financing activities from operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As the principal financier, Finance raised money from financial institutions outside the BHPB Group by way of loan facilities, the issue of commercial paper and medium term notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Each year, the BHPB board set the borrowing limits and the borrowing program to be carried out by Finance for the next 12 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">That program stipulated the proportions of short and long term debt, the mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt and the mix of currencies in which funds were to be borrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">For example, for the financial year ended 31 May 1996, the BHPB board granted approval for loan and other financing facilities in the name of Finance (or any other wholly owned subsidiary) for an amount not exceeding $2,275 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A committee of the board, consisting of two or more of the Managing Director, the Executive General Manager Finance and the Corporate Treasurer was appointed for the purposes of, inter alia, "[a]pproving, executing, delivering and performing all terms and conditions and documentation of loan and other financing facilities to be arranged by [Finance] or any other wholly owned subsidiary up to a total of $2,275 million and all terms and conditions and documentation of guarantees to be issued by [BHPB] in respect of these facilities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Consistent with the annual resolutions of the board of BHPB, over the relevant period Finance raised large sums of money from a variety of sources: From banks and financiers outside of the BHPB Group by way of medium to long term facilities and by way of short to medium term facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In the period from 17 December 1986 to 8 May 1996, Finance was the borrower under medium to long term facilities totalling billions of dollars in various currencies from numerous international financial institutions including:

 In addition, Finance entered into interest rate and currency exchange swaps with third party financial institutions to limit exposure to risks of fluctuations over the short and long term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Samples of some of the agreements entered into by, and information memoranda issued by, Finance were tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In respect of each loan agreement in evidence, Finance was the borrower with its obligations guaranteed by BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It was also the issuer of the information memoranda (guaranteed by BHPB) and it was the contracting party to the Master Swap agreements (with the obligations guaranteed by BHPB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">During the 1990's, Finance's board comprised senior executives from the BHPB Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">By way of example, from 1996 to 1999, Mr GW McGregor, the Executive General Manager Finance for the BHPB Group, was also a director of both BHPB and Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Finance did not have its own staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It utilised the services of BHPB for which it paid management fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The fees reflected the proportion of time BHPB personnel spent in providing services to Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In the case of Finance, most of the services provided by BHPB were accounting and treasury personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The BHPB treasury personnel had responsibility for determining the cash flow requirements of the BHPB Group using data provided by the operating divisions and relevant corporate staff, arranging the funding of those requirements and determining the form in which the funds would be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Performance of those tasks was subject to "Treasury Guidelines" prepared annually by the Treasurer &amp; Vice President Corporate Finance which were then reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and ultimately approved by the BHPB board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The guidelines provided a series of rules and protocols for a wide range of matters including credit limits (the total amount that could be borrowed from third parties), foreign exchange risk management, guarantees, interest rate and currency swaps, loan facilities and money market activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The cash flow requirements of the BHPB Group were assessed on an annual basis through the preparation of annual rolling budgets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Each business unit prepared a budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Those budgets were then aggregated to form the BHPB Group budget which was ultimately approved by the BHPB board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Preparation of the BHPB Group budget commenced in the March preceding the commencement of the next financial year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The budget forecasts (cash inflows and cash outflows) were prepared for five years on a rolling basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The forecasts took into account "operating revenues, new (and yet to be approved) capital investments, capital expenditure sustaining existing projects, exploration expenditure and operating costs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Once the budget was approved by the BHPB board, the budget necessarily identified the cash flow shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The manner in which the shortfall was funded was determined by the Corporate General Manager Taxation, the Corporate Treasurer and, ultimately, the Corporate General Manager Accounting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">During the relevant period, the policy was recorded in Section 21.19 of the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual as at May 1996 entitled "Funding of Group Companies" in the following terms: 
Details of proposed equity and / or debt funding of new group companies, or of revised funding structures for existing group companies, should initially be provided to the Corporate General Manager Accounting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Proposals will be passed on to the Corporate General Manager Taxation and to the Corporate Treasurer for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Corporate General Manager Accounting will provide Business Groups with a written "sign off" once the Corporate General Manager Taxation and the Corporate Treasurer have indicated that the proposed funding structure is acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The proposed funding structure should only be put in place upon receipt of this "sign off".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Continuous Review 
 
 
Capital funding structures of controlled entities should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the structure remains appropriate to the entities' operational and financial standing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">For example, the 100% debt funding of an existing company's activities, other than on a temporary basis, is generally considered to be inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Similarly a company with high debt and little equity may need to have its structure reviewed if the consequential interest burden is leading the company into negative shareholder funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Reviews of company funding structures must be done in collaboration with the responsible taxation officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Before turning to consider the projects the subject of dispute in these proceedings, other aspects of the funding of group companies should be noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">First, most BHPB Group companies with bank accounts in Australian currency were part of an ANZ (AFT) sweep facility arranged through Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">At the end of each day, each account balance was automatically transferred to a single bank account held by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">A similar arrangement was set up between Finance and Chase Manhattan Bank for BHPB Group companies with bank accounts maintained in US dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">A positive bank account of a BHPB Group subsidiary swept to Finance resulted in a credit to the subsidiary's loan account with Finance and each negative balance swept to Finance resulted in a debit to the subsidiary's deposit account with Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Any surplus cash would then be placed by Finance on the overnight money market with third party financial institutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Secondly, as a result of the process of capital expenditure approval, selection of appropriate funding structures and the banking arrangements referred to in these reasons for decision, the value of loans made by Finance to BHPB Group companies totalled billions of dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">For example, in the 1995 and 1996 years of income, Finance made loans to the entities listed in Schedule A totalling in excess of $17 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Finance had standard lending terms for the inter-company loans which, for the relevant period, were adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Those terms provided: 
... intercompany loans granted by [Finance] to [BHPB] or its subsidiaries (together the "[BHPB] Group") from 1 December 1994 will, unless special terms are negotiated for a particular loan, be subject to the following conditions:
 
 The interest rate will be 10.45% per annum or such other rate as may be nominated in advance from time to time by [Finance] as the relevant [BHPB] Group intercompany loan rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Such interest shall be due and payable within 21 (twenty-one) days of the day on which the relevant outstanding loan is repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Loans are to be made up of such amounts and are to be advanced on such dates as are agreed orally from time to time by the borrower and [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Each initial loan and each additional loan is to be for a period not exceeding five months at which time all loans shall become immediately repayable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The currency of each loan will be Australian Dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The application of the loan funds will be to fund normal operating activities including research and development where applicable, of the borrower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
e) Commitment fees will not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Unless otherwise designated, any repayments shall be applied to reduce the earliest outstanding advance and then be applied first against individual loans in excess of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">For administrative convenience, each loan made by [Finance] under this arrangement will be entered into the one loan account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">However it is acknowledged that each amount advanced is a separate loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">[Finance] will consider renewing loans at the close of each five month period should the borrower advise (orally) that it wishes to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">One relevant change to these terms and conditions was an adjustment to the inter-company interest rate on 3 March 1995 as a result of a review undertaken by officers from the departments of Corporate General Manager Taxation and Manager Corporate Accounting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">After that review, the Corporate Treasurer recommended the following rates apply: 
 Australian Dollars 
 
 
11.40% on funds advanced by [Finance]
 
7.40% on funds borrowed by [Finance]
 
 
Where interest payments/receipts are made/received sixty (60) days in advance, the following rates apply:
 
 
11.20% on funds advanced by [Finance]
 
7.20% on funds borrowed by [Finance]
 
 
...
 
 
Would you please ensure that all subsidiaries are advised of these rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">As a result of the standard loan terms and in particular cll (b) and (h) of those loan terms (see [21] above), each loan from Finance to a BHPB Group member (including BHPDRI and BHPTM the subject of dispute in these proceedings) was for a five (5) month term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is not in dispute that the interest rate charged on loans from Finance to BHPB Group companies was higher than the interest rate at which it borrowed those funds from external third parties and from other members of the BHPB Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Interest derived by Finance on the loans made to BHPB Group members accrued on a daily basis and was returned as assessable income on an accruals basis in Finance's income tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">As a result of the activities of Finance, it earned substantial interest income generating substantial accounting profits after tax and taxable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The gross interest income, the accounting profits (after tax) and the taxable income of Finance from 1986 to 2002 (before rebates and deductions for tax losses carried forward by or transferred to Finance) was as follows: Year Interest Income

 It is necessary to consider separately the projects constructed and operated by BHPDRI and BHPTM, the subject of dispute in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">(c) BHPDRI
 This project involved the construction of a HBI plant at Port Hedland in Western Australia to produce briquettes from iron ore fines which, in 1995, were not only considered to have little if any economic value but were an impediment to the extraction and sale of ore because of the area required to store the fines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The intention was that "the production and sale of HBI would convert fines with little value to a valuable product and would provide further economic value for the BHPB group" by: (1) enabling more lump ore to be extracted and sold; and (2) satisfying obligations imposed upon BHPM by the Western Australian Government to undertake secondary processing of iron ore in that State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Advice and assistance was sought by BHPIO (TB Janes) about the capital structure of BHPDRI in June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">At that time, BHPDRI had paid up capital of $20 million and a submission to the BHPB board seeking approval for expenditure to build a HBI plant near BHPB's Port Hedland operations had not yet been considered by the BHPB board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">If the total expenditure for the project was ultimately approved, $300 million was forecast to be spent in the 1996 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">On the assumption that approval from the BHPB board was obtained, on 15 June 1995 BHPIO requested advice and assistance on the preferred capital structure and debt/equity mix and to put the necessary arrangements in place for the issue of additional equity, the establishment of an appropriate inter-company loan and to ensure that the internal funding procedures were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">On 16 June 1995, the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM (Mr JK Ellis) sought approval from the BHPB board for the expenditure of A$1,550 million to build the HBI plant near BHPIO's Port Hedland operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The HBI capital expenditure submission recorded that based on 100% BHPB ownership of the project's assets (other than the tunnel), inter alia: the nominal IRR of the proposal was 22.1% (17.7% real) with a payback period of 5 years from project completion in June 1998; the incremental NPV was: 
 A$M 
 
at 15% discount rate on real cashflows 160
 
at 12.5% discount rate on nominal cashflows 870
 
at 8.25% discount rate on real cashflows 940
 
 the forecasted results reflected the strategic and incremental benefits to the BHPB Group as a whole and, in particular, BHPB's iron ore business, from the construction of the proposed HBI plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The BHPM Capital Procedures Manual in place in June 1995 dictated the structure and content of capital expenditure submissions including the HBI capital expenditure submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">For example, it was the Manual which required, inter alia , that: submissions were authorised by the BHPB board on the basis of their BHPB Group impact and therefore had to be presented from that perspective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">All inter-business group and inter-divisional group implications had to be considered including the strategic importance to BHPM, the relationship or impacts on the performance of other parts of BHPB and the rationale supporting the expenditure: Sections 2.2, 3.2, Appendix 1 --- Submission Checklist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">all projects had to be in the first instance evaluated on an ungeared or unleveraged basis to highlight the basic return on total assets employed by the project: Appendix 4 --- Common Pitfalls of Investment Analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The board submission (see [28] above) was supported by a two volume feasibility report comprising (1) a detailed HBI Facility Financial Model and (2) BHPIO Consolidated and Entity Financial Summaries which had been prepared on two distinct bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Summaries for ten entities were included, one of which was BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Each entity summary considered the project on a stand alone basis for that respective entity on stated assumptions.</sentence>

<sentence id="s116">On 28 June 1995, BHPM (Taxation) provided the advice sought by BHPIO in its memorandum of 15 June 1995 (see [27] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The advice was in the following terms: 
In response to your note of 15 June 1995, I feel it will be appropriate for BHPDRI to continue as the project entity.</sentence>

 The next day, 29 June 1995, the board of BHPB approved capital expenditure of A$1,550m on the HBI project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The presentation to the BHPB board was made by the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM, Mr JK Ellis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Subsequent to the presentation and in response to questions raised during the presentation, on 5 July 1995 further details were provided by Mr Ellis to the Managing Director of BHPB about the profit impact of additional ore sales and the composition of the consequential capital of $1,200m included in the HBI cash flow analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">What then occurred was not explained other than in the most general terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">However, the loan facility for BHPDRI was established with Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was not in dispute that the terms of that loan were in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans which were adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 set out at [21] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">As a result of the standard loan terms and in particular cll (b) and (h) of those terms (see [21] - [23] above), each loan was for a five (5) month term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">To accommodate the fact that at the end of each five month period a fresh advance was made, there were two loan accounts for the loan to BHPDRI from Finance --- account numbers 325320 and 326320 --- which were used for alternate 5 month periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Initially loan account 326320 was used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The opening entry in that account on 31 July 1995 was a debit entry of $8,200,137.58 with the notation "I/CO TRANSFER REF G KERNI".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On 1 October 1995, that loan account with a debit balance of $20,422,717.50 was closed and a new advance in the sum of $20,422,717.50 was made by Finance to BHPDRI in account number 325320.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In October 1995 and May 1996, the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 35 million and then, subsequently, 75 million $1.00 shares to BHPM Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">During September and October 1996, an exhaustive review of the HBI project was undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">As a result of that review, two events occurred in November 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">First, on 12 November 1996, BHPIO (T Janes) revisited the question of the capital structure of BHPDRI which had been adopted in June 1995 (see [31] above) and secondly, BHPM sought approval from BHPB for additional capital expenditure of A$140 million over and above that approved in June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That capital expenditure submission was prepared in accordance with the Applicable Capital Procedures Manual then in place dated October 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Prior to the further capital expenditure submission being considered by the BHPB board, both the question of the appropriate debt/equity mix and funding structure for the capital expenditure, consistent with the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual (see [19] above), was considered by Corporate Taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Approval was received for: an equity investment of $370m to be made by BHPM Holdings in BHPDRI after 31 December 1996; and to continue the equity funding of BHPDRI on the basis of a 50 / 50 debt to equity ratio (as had existed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In reaching those conclusions, the required debt to equity level was considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The advice provided by BHPM Taxation on that issue was that: 
... it has been seen that the selection of a debt to equity ratio is a matter of choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The selection should therefore take into account the intended purpose of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">This company will primarily be involved in the export sale of beneficiated product where it maybe [sic] competing directly with local suppliers in foreign countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">From past experience with claims that our companies are resorting to unfair competition by dumping produce on foreign markets based on the observation that the particular companies never make any profits we need to ensure that this company is not saddled with a level of debt that leads to it being branded in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">For this reason we consider that the current debt to equity ratio (50%/50%) should be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">On 29 November 1996, the BHPB board approved revised capital expenditure on the HBI project from A$1,550,000,000 to $1,673,600,000.</sentence>

<sentence id="s151">Consistent with the advice received from Corporate Taxation, on 30 January 1997 the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 370 million $1 shares to BHPM Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As the general ledger for the loans from Finance to BHPDRI records, Finance advanced funds to BHPDRI which, together with the subscriptions of capital, were used progressively to pay expenses incurred by BHPDRI in the development and construction of the HBI plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In addition, the general ledger trial balance recording the loan from Finance to BHPDRI reflects that the loan was conducted in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 (see [21] - [23] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In August 1997, BHPB's Managing Director (Mr Prescott) asked Mr McGregor to conduct a review of the HBI project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">At that time, one of the central issues raised by Mr Prescott was that, from the start of the project, not all of the risks associated with the project were understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">At the time of the review, Mr McGregor was Executive General Manager Finance for the BHPB Group as well as a director of both BHPB and Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The review was completed by 11 September 1997 ("the HBI Audit Report").</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The HBI Audit Report attached to the memorandum from Mr McGregor is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That report stated, inter alia, that: the projected NOPAT [net operating profit after tax] and ROC [return on capital] from the HBI plant per se were very modest, which was recognised at the time of the initial capital submission; escalation in Capex and cash operation costs (thought to be $140 per tonne) meant that the HBI project on a stand alone basis would not generate a return in excess of 1.5% to 2.5%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">(This is to be compared with the fact that the Detailed Capital Submission Report in 1995 showed that the HBI Plant on a stand alone basis had a DCF rate of return of 3.5%); HBI was a low margin business that needed cheap gas, cheap electricity, low capital costs and low operating cost to succeed and the HBI project was challenged in relation to each of these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">At that time, the choice was to abandon the project altogether or persist with completion as economically and expeditiously as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In the best interests of Finance and the BHPB Group, Mr McGregor concluded that "a forward view of the project reveal[ed] that there [was] no case to be made for either abandoning the project or slowing it down [and that] the only sensible course of action [was] to complete the project as expeditiously and cheaply as possible".</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">As a result, Mr McGregor sought approval for total capital expenditure on the HBI plant of $2,275 million plus $128 million for commissioning costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Consistent with the McGregor recommendation, on 18 November 1997, the Chief Executive Officer of BHP Ferrous Minerals forwarded to the Managing Director of BHPB (Mr Prescott) a memorandum entitled "[HBI] Project Supplementary Authorisation" seeking additional capital expenditure of $730 million, an increase of 44% above the existing authorisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Based on an incremental cost to complete the project of $550 million, the memorandum reported that (1) the incremental NPV (nominal at 12.5%) was expected to be $888 million with a nominal IRR of 32.3% and (2) if the project did not proceed, the associated NPV loss was expected to be $429 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The projected cash flows from the HBI project were set out in Attachment 1 to the "[HBI] Project Supplementary Authorisation" to be: Financial Summary Year 1 1998 Year 2 1999 Year 3 2000 Year 4 
 2001 Year 5 
 2002 Subsequent Years (Average) 
 Cash 
Flow 
A$M -948.8 -549.8 -91.8 360.5 244.7 557.1 
 
The uncontroverted evidence was that these projected "cash flows" were calculated prior to commissioning of the project by reference to the outgoings incurred, and then, after commissioning, were calculated by deducting expected costs and the cost of replacement of capital from projected revenues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">By year six, the projected cash flows were positive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">A payback period of six to seven years was expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Mr McGregor's recommendation together with the supplementary capital expenditure submission was considered and accepted by the BHPB board on 27 November 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">After the board meeting, the Managing Director of BHPB (Mr Prescott) forwarded a memorandum to the Chief Executive Officer BHP Ferrous Minerals, copied to the Executive Director Finance, on 1 December 1997 in the following terms: 
I confirm that the Board at its meeting on 27 November gave approval for completing and commissioning the Pilbara HBI project as recommended in your memo of 18 November 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In so doing the Board gave approval for the expenditure of an additional $730 million on the project comprising $668 million in additional capital spending and $62 million in additional capitalised pre-commissioning operating expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In implementing this approval the following imperatives apply:
 
 Every effort must be made to improve the commercial outcomes of the entire project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">There is to be clear and thorough reporting of all significant developments in a timely fashion including all management action to address issues that may arise or opportunities for project outcomes to be improved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">This reporting is to be monthly through Iron Ore's Business Reports and through appropriate comments in the Managing Director's Report, also monthly through Project Management's Business Report and quarterly (or more frequently if required) in the Business Reports presented to the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">We are to pursue the proposal to sell down 15% of the project to our Japanese partners in our other iron ore businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">We are to further investigate the advantages and disadvantages of iron ore feed price alternatives to the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
A copy of this memorandum was sent to Mr Lance Coburn who at this time was the Group General Manager, BHPM Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In his capacity as Group General Manager, BHPM Finance, Mr Coburn had responsibility for the financial aspects of BHPM, which included preparation of statutory accounts for most of the entities within BHPM, and responsibility to ensure compliance with BHPB Group policies and procedures in preparation of capital expenditure submissions and compliance with capital expenditure approvals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">On 5 December 1997, the Group General Manager BHPB Budgets and Accounting sent a note to Mr McGregor (at that time the Executive General Manager, Finance and a director of Finance) entitled "Asset Carrying Values".</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The note listed those assets which did not or would not provide a return of 10% or greater by May 1998 based on current book values.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">One of the assets listed was the HBI plant as a stand alone asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The NPV of that operation based on book value determined on a 10% DCF basis was negative $657 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">This value did not include any benefits from the plant to be derived by the iron ore mines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Construction of the HBI Plant continued throughout 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Two critical events occurred during the course of that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">At the end of the 1998 financial year (31 May 1998) the board of BHPB changed its accounting policy for determining the recoverable value of non-current assets from undiscounted future net cash flows to discounted cash flows using the weighted average pre-tax interest rate of the BHPB Group's long term borrowings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">This change was adopted to reconcile the accounts prepared under the Australian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") with those applicable under United States GAAP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">As a result of this change, adjustments were made to the recoverable value of non-current assets which resulted in changes to BHPB's profit and shareholders' equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In the case of BHPDRI, as at 31 May 1998, the carrying value of BHPDRI's non current assets was written down by $590 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The financial effect of the write down was to reduce the carrying value of certain assets of BHPDRI by that amount and to reduce BHPDRI's profit by $377,600,000 (after tax).</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The second event was an update on the HBI project presented to the BHPB board on 27 November 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">By that time, construction of the plant was "largely complete" with the first briquette expected at the end of January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">However, there were still problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The US scrap price had plunged to new depths and the estimated sales of briquettes would not require full plant capacity once the plant was completed and commissioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">At that time, the options were to "[c]ommission all trains on current schedule (1/99, 4/99, 5/99, 6/99) [and] Operate 1 train and others necessary to meet market" or "Defer Completion &amp; Commissioning Module 2 [and] Commission &amp; Operate When Market Justifies (2002?)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">On 30 November 1998, the BHPB board agreed that BHP Ferrous Minerals "should complete construction of the entire plant, commission all trains on [the] current schedule and then operate only those trains necessary to meet (R&amp;D) testing and product sales requirements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Consistent with the recommendation and subsequent approval by the BHPB board, train 1 of the HBI Plant was commissioned in early January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">However, it was shut down after 10 days because of production difficulties associated with the reduction process to produce DRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The production difficulties were caused by the iron ore and partly reduced material not flowing continuously through the reactor train.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">There were frequent, sudden flow stoppages which upset the process and any attempt to balance the heat and mass flows in the reactor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">In addition, the stoppages greatly increased the rate of accretion growth which required the reactors to be cleaned every 25 rather than every 160 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">At the end of the 1999 financial year, the carrying value of the HBI plant was written down by a further $531 million after tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">On 21 July 1999, a letter was sent on BHPB letterhead from Joe Czyzewski, a director of Finance, to the directors of BHPDRI in the following terms: 
[Finance] is aware that [BHPDRI] has commenced selling product and is working towards generating a viable cash flow in order to service its loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In the circumstances, [Finance] confirms that it does not intend for the period of twelve month's (sic) from the date of this letter, or for such shorter period as we may specify at our election, intend to seek repayment of any loan it may have with [BHPDRI] but shall keep the company's commercial performance under ongoing review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Prior notice shall be given to you should it become necessary for [Finance] to take action in respect of any loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In March 2000, a further review of the HBI project was undertaken in response to the BHPB board's concerns about current performance of the operations and the inability of the plant to meet commissioning targets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">At the BHPB board meeting on 23 March 2000, a presentation was made about the future of the HBI plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The board resolved: (1) that trials to assess the technical adequacy and commercial viability of the HBI facility should proceed until September 2000 when the board would again review the investment; and (2) to approve additional capital expenditure of $46 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">At the same time, a review of the carrying value of the asset was to be completed by the end of April 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The board of Finance met on 30 March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">After noting the decisions of the BHPB board on 23 March 2000 and that BHPDRI was indebted to Finance in the amount of $2,113,944,530, the Finance board resolved to write to the BHPDRI directors to advise them that Finance would conduct a review of the loan by engaging Ernst &amp; Young as independent experts to report on the valuation of the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Pending receipt of the Ernst &amp; Young report, the directors of Finance agreed that a provision be made against the loan in Finance's books by adopting the "worst case" scenario which indicated a negative carrying value of the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Further consideration of the question of interest on the loan was deferred pending receipt of the Ernst &amp; Young report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Moreover, the directors of Finance agreed to review the provision of further loans to BHPDRI after discussions with BHPB management and to keep the BHPDRI loan under close review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">On 3 April 2000, Finance informed BHPDRI of these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">As a result of Finance making provision on 31 March 2000 of a $2,174 million doubtful debt for its loan to BHPDRI, Finance was left with negative net assets in excess of $940 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The BHBP Group Treasurer (Mr Czyzewski) was concerned that if the situation was not corrected, Finance may have been in breach of its various loan and financing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Accordingly, on 7 April 2000, he sought immediate approval for BHPB to seek an allotment of 950 million ordinary fully paid up shares in Finance (the consideration for such an allotment was to be $950 million).</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">On the same day that approval was sought for BHPB to seek allotment of 950 million shares in Finance (7 April 2000), the Chief Financial Officer of BHPB wrote to BHPDRI in the following terms: 
At its meeting on 23 and 24 March 2000 the Board of [BHPB] approved additional funding of [BHPDRI] until September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">[Finance] has discussed the provision of further loan funds to [BHPDRI] through the existing intercompany loan facility and advised that it is unable to fund the further approved expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The shareholder of [BHPDRI], [BHPM Holdings] has agreed to inject equity into [BHPDRI] with a total issue price of $150 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">This equity injection will be completed immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">[BHPB] has agreed to subscribe for equity in [BHPM Holdings] as may be necessary to enable [BHPM Holdings] to meet the equity injection into [BHPDRI].</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Approval for BHPB to seek an allotment of 950 million shares in Finance was provided and, on 11 April 2000, the directors of Finance resolved to allot 950 million ordinary fully paid $1.00 shares to BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">At the same time, BHPB Accounting and Reporting made changes to the loan account between Finance and BHPDRI on 10 April in the following ways: 
The current loan account between [Finance] and [BHPDRI] (account number 23700011) will be 'frozen' at the 31 March 2000 closing balance, including capitalised interest yet to be booked to that date (Note: there have been no transactions since 1 April 2000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">To facilitate the day to day cash transactions of [BHPDRI], an intercompany loan account between [BHPB] and [BHPDRI] has been established and should be used from today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The account number is 23700012 and is a standard [BHPB] short term, interest free loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Following the $150 million equity injection, this intercompany loan account must be maintained as an asset loan (debit balance) in [BHPDRI's] accounts as the funding of HBI operations is via equity not the loan facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">A request for further equity funding will be necessary if required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">...
 
 
(emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">After providing their preliminary views in April 2000, Ernst &amp; Young tendered their report on the valuation of the BHPDRI loan receivable to the directors of Finance on 3 May 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Ernst &amp; Young concluded that the value of the HBI plant did not exceed $346 million and had a nil value if the plant was closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The report was considered by the directors of Finance at a meeting of the board held on the day the report was issued, 3 May 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The directors resolved that: the Directors having made due inquiries and on the basis of the advice and conclusions given to Directors by the independent expert, have formed the view that the amount of $1,845,833,281 lent to [BHPDRI] is irrecoverable and bad and be written-off as bad;
 
2) (a) the entries be made in the accounts of [Finance] to record the write-off of the irrecoverable amount pursuant to Resolution 1 forthwith; and
 
 
 (b) the provision continue to be carried against the balance of the loan not written-off being $346,000,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">subject to the above accounting entries being completed, [BHPDRI] be subsequently notified that due to the poor financial condition of [BHPDRI] it would not be economically prudent to expend additional monies in taking proceedings to recover any or all of the said monies once they have been written off ...
 
The Directors went on to note that interest on the loan would continue to be capitalised on the balance not written off and provided as doubtful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">On 10 May 2000, Finance wrote to both the directors of BHPDRI and to BHPDRI advising of the loan write off of $1,845,833,281 against the outstanding principal and interest of $2,191,833,281 and that following the write off, the directors of Finance had resolved not to take any further action to recover the debt written off as it appeared practically irrecoverable but that Finance reserved the right to recover the balance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The letter went on to state that Finance did not intend to seek repayment of the balance for the period up to 15 June 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">On 18 May 2000, the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 150 million $1 shares to BHPM Holdings.</sentence>

 BHPTM (known as Mineral Deposits Pty Ltd until 14 July 1995) had a long history of mining titanium minerals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">It had titanium minerals mining operations and a processing plant in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">BHPTM also held a mining lease over a large resource of titanium minerals (predominantly ilmenite) at Beenup in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">In November 1994, the proposal was to develop ilmenite mining and processing facilities at Beenup in Western Australia and to purchase an interest in an existing ilmenite smelting facility at Tyssedal in Norway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The proposal was to mine the ore body (containing ilmenite and other heavy minerals) at Beenup and to truck the heavy mineral products to the Port of Bunbury for export to the Tyssedal Facility and other users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The mine and associated processing facilities were to be conducted by BHPTM.</sentence>

<sentence id="s276">On 17 July 1997, a second letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Again, so far as is relevant, the letter was largely in the same terms as the first letter of comfort (see [66] above) but for cl 5.1(a) which stated "the expiry of one year from the date of this letter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The board minutes of BHPTM resolved that "on the basis of" the 17 July 1997 letter of comfort, there were reasonable grounds to believe that BHPTM would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due and the board authorised the directors to sign the relevant statement to be provided under s 301 of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">By late 1997, BHPTM's Beenup mine had experienced significant operational difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The material being mined at Beenup was much harder than expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Further complications had arisen in disposing of and storing the tailings from the mining operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">By the end of the 1998 financial year (31 May 1998), the project was continuing to encounter serious difficulties and, as a result, was not meeting its contractual commitments to supply titanium minerals to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Two steps were taken by BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">First, BHPTM declared force majeure under the terms of the Norwegian Contract and secondly, following a review of the carrying value of assets undertaken as part of the preparation of BHPTM's financial statements for the 1998 year (ending 31 May 1998), on 18 June 1998 Mr McGregor (as Executive General Manager Finance) recommended to the BHPB board that it approve writing down the carrying value of the Beenup assets by $99 million (after tax) on the assumption that an economically feasible solution would be developed to overcome the operational difficulties at the mine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">As noted earlier (see [45] above), on 31 May 1998, the BHPB Group changed its accounting policy for determining the carrying value of assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">On 9 July 1998, a third letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">But for the date, the letter was in the same terms as the second letter of comfort (see [68] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The board minutes of BHPTM again resolved "on the basis of" the 9 July 1998 letter of comfort that there were reasonable grounds to believe that BHPTM would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due and the board authorised the directors to sign the relevant statement to be provided under s 301 of the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Between May and November 1998, further work continued on the Beenup mine particularly in relation to the issue of disposal of the tailings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Throughout this period, the board of BHPB continued to approve and support the operations.</sentence>

<sentence id="s292">The carrying value of the Beenup assets was again reconsidered during the preparation of the half yearly accounts for the period ended 30 November 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Following consideration of a memorandum prepared by Mr Jim Hall (the Group General Manager BHPB Budgets &amp; Accounting) to the Executive Director Finance dated 3 December 1998, the audit committee of BHPB resolved at a meeting on 17 December 1998 that the carrying value of the Beenup assets be retained at $114 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The memorandum recorded: at 31 May 1998, the carrying value of the Beenup assets was written down by $150 million (pre tax) to $134 million because of technical and other operational problems; between 31 May and 30 November 1998, significant progress had been made on a tailings disposal solution but the work was approximately 4 months behind plan; the carrying value for the half year November 1998 was fundamentally unchanged from May 1998 and again assumed an economically feasible technical solution to the technical and other operational problem s; at the BHPB board meeting on 27 November 1998, a quarterly review of the Beenup project was presented to the board at which time the board agreed to continue with operations and in parallel to examine exit options, including by sale, merger or closure; the exit options and valuations were to be formalised by 31 May 1999 and if the closure option was adopted, then in addition to considering the carrying value, the BHPB accounts would need to include allowance for rehabilitation and site closure costs, breach of contract claims from customers and other costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Technical difficulties, however, continued to affect the mine and, in February 1999, a decision was made to close the plant and write off the balance of the carrying value of the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">On 26 February 1999, BHPB issued a press release announcing the closure of the mine in the following terms: 
The decision follows an extensive study into technical problems caused by the high clay content of the Beenup orebody which had impacted on the management of tailings and the mine's ability to reach satisfactory levels of production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">President [BHPTM], Mr CE (Colin) Smith said the Company had directed considerable engineering and technical resources at resolving the problems at Beenup over a 12 month period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">"After significant effort, it just wasn't possible to find a feasible solution that would allow the operations to continue.</sentence>

<sentence id="s300">That time has come.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">We have taken the engineering and technical research as far as we can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Mr Smith said [BHPB] had looked for a buyer with access to different technology and alternative business objectives for Beenup, but it had become apparent in recent days that this would not be possible.</sentence>

 Operations at the plant ceased on 16 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">After the mine closed, the directors of BHPTM conducted a review of options available to the company and considered the means by which BHPTM might have been able to service its loan with Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">That review continued at least from May until August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">On 31 May 1999, Finance provided approximately $62 million to BHPTM to enable it to repay an overdraft it had with the ANZ bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">On 8 July 1999, a fourth letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Again, so far as is relevant, the letter was largely in the same terms as the second letter of comfort (see [68] above) but for the addition of the words "[i]t does not and is not intended to impose any contractual or legal obligations on [BHPB] in respect of any other person nor bind it to any particular requirement or course of action" to the end of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Before that letter of comfort was considered by the directors of BHPTM, the Group Treasurer (Mr J Czyzewski) informed the directors of BHPTM by letter dated 9 July 1999 that: 
I note that the Directors are expecting to have the benefit of a Letter of Comfort from its parent, [BHPB], in the same form as the attached draft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">[Finance] confirms that it will not demand payment of its loan to the company pending a complete review of the company's future operations, including current proposals to transfer a commercial Group operation into the company.</sentence>

<sentence id="s315">[Finance] shall advise the directors prior to taking any action in respect of its loan following the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">At a meeting held on 19 July 1999, the directors of BHPTM tabled the annual accounts for the 1999 year and after referring to the 8 July 1999 letter of comfort undertaking "(on a conditional basis) to provide sufficient funds to the Company to enable it to pay debts which the Company elects to incur", the board was of the opinion "there were reasonable grounds to believe that [BHPTM] would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due" and authorised the directors to sign the relevant statements to be provided under the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">BHPTM completed its review of options by early August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">At a meeting of directors of BHPTM on 18 August 1999 (chaired by Mr Coburn) the directors considered the options for meeting the existing and ongoing obligations of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The minutes record what transpired at that meeting in the following terms: 
The outcome of recent discussions with the owners of certain profitable mining operations regarding proposals for the transfer of assets into [BHPTM] to strengthen its balance sheet, and as a result, to assist with the servicing of the [Finance] debt, was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">It was noted that the discussions under consideration had produced no agreement and will not be pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It was agreed that no other options for improving the liquidity of [BHPTM] were apparent and it was therefore necessary to consider the means of meeting the company's existing and future obligations, in particular, the loan payable to [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">[Finance] had provided an undertaking not to call its loan until a review of the reorganisation opportunities had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">[Finance] has now requested the company to provide details of this review on Friday 20 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">It was agreed that Mr Coburn make the presentation to the board of [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Finally, the directors examined the balance sheet of the company to ascertain the likely shortfall on realisation of the company's assets to meet existing obligations in the event that a demand for payment may issue from [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The directors are currently relying upon the terms of the comfort letter that was provided by the parent, [BHPB], on 8 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">...
 
 On 20 August 1999, two events occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">First, BHPTM (Mr Coburn) sent a letter to Finance concerning the future operations of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The letter stated: 
BHPTM has been closely reviewing certain options for the transfer of a profitable mining operation into the company to bolster its balance sheet, and as a corollary, to introduce some means of servicing its loan from [Finance] over an extended period, thus avoiding an event of default.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The discussions with other Group entities concerning these proposals have ended without agreement as the options under consideration were not feasible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In view of this, the prospects of expanding the company's activities to assist with the servicing and repayment of its debt to [Finance] are now, in all likelihood, non-existent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The directors are presently reviewing the company's balance sheet to assess its ability to meet existing and ongoing obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Should [Finance] call [on] its loan in the immediate future, the directors believe that [Finance] would realise little more than the amount of $11.5 million that BHPTM currently has on deposit with [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">That letter, together with a presentation on the financial position of BHPTM from Mr Coburn, was considered at a meeting of directors of Finance held on 20 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">By that date, Mr McGregor had taken leave of absence pending his imminent retirement and the directors attending the meeting were Mr Czyzewski (the Corporate Treasurer) and Messrs HE Rose and BJ Skahill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">BHPTM's financial position was summarised as follows: YEM '99 financials poor
 Nopat [Net Operating Profit After Tax] Loss $13 million [before abnormals] Ebit [Earnings Before Interest and Tax] Loss $25 million [before abnormals]
 Beenup operations closed in February 1999
 Write-offs [after tax] as follows:

<sentence id="s339">With the exception of some land which may realise a $2-$3 million above book value, all assets in the attached balance sheet are believed to be at realisable value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Any future proceeds will be used to satisfy priority claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The prospects of servicing or repaying the loan from [Finance] are non-existent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">That same day, 20 August 1999, the Vice President Group Accounting &amp; Reporting, Mr J Hall, forwarded a memorandum to Mr Chip Goodyear concerning the loan from Finance to BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">A copy of the memorandum was provided to Mr Czyzewski, the Corporate Treasurer and a director of Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">After setting out the problems faced by BHPTM and the fact that the directors of BHPTM had advised Finance of the outcome of the recent review, the memorandum continued: 
Therefore, the Directors of [Finance] are proposing to write-down the majority of the loan to [BHPTM] of $336 million to its realisable value, having regard to the borrowing company's financial position and outlook.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It is likely the Company will eventually be liquidated following satisfaction of its commercial obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The write-down will be disclosed in the accounts of [Finance] as a bad debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">In order to reflect this in the accounts of the affected companies, a number of actions are recommended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">[BHPB] will revoke the Letter of Comfort provided to [BHPTM] on 8 July 1999 and to create a new, but limited, Deed of Support to the extent of future external debts only including any obligations pertaining to the Beenup Project imposed on the Company under the Mining Agreement with the State Government of Western Australia.</sentence>

<sentence id="s366">The minutes of the meeting record that after Mr Coburn explained the outcome of his presentation to the board of Finance, Mr Coburn: tabled the letter from BHPB of 23 August 1999 notifying of its intention to revoke the letter of comfort of 8 July 1999 and that, in substitution, BHPB proposed to enter into a new "comfort undertaking" with BHPTM in the form of a Deed of Support which subsumed the letter of comfort; explained that there existed some doubt as to the enforceability of the undertaking provided in the letter of comfort of 8 July 1999 whereas the Deed offered greater security as it would be legally enforceable; and recommended that the offer from BHPB be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The minutes record that the legal ramifications of entering into the Deed and the impact on directors' responsibilities were then discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">After agreeing to review the trading position of BHPTM later in that day, the directors resolved that each of them would sign the Deed of Support and affix the company seal to the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The Deed of Support was executed and bears the date "23 August 1999".</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">That was not all that happened on 23 August.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">At 12 noon, 15 minutes after the meeting of directors of BHPTM concluded, and one assumes after the Deed of Support had been executed, the directors of Finance met and resolved to call for payment of the BHPTM loan of $339,216,146.22 set off against the deposit of $11,593,237.88 and in the event that there was a failure to repay the balance, to write off the balance outstanding of $310,881,702.40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Consistent with that resolution, a letter was sent by Mr Czyzewski for and on behalf of Finance to Mr Coburn as a director of BHPTM in the following terms: 
We refer to our letter of 9 July 1999 wherein [Finance] gave an undertaking that it would not call its loan whilst the company reviewed its future options which included the proposed transfer of a profitable mining operation into the company to bolster its balance sheet and to introduce a source of ongoing funds which would assist with the servicing of the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">You advised [Finance] at a meeting on 20 August 1999 that the review has now been completed and that it was decided that it was not appropriate to pursue the options under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">We have also been advised that the letter of comfort dated 8 July 1999 provided by [BHPB] to BHPTM has now been cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">This in combination with the results of our assessment of the financial position of BHPTM indicates to us that a material adverse change has occurred in the general financial condition of BHPTM which could materially effect (sic) its ability to perform its loan obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">We advise that the loan facility is hereby cancelled and we now declare the loan and all interest accrued thereon amounting to $339,216,416.22 forthwith due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Please remit these funds immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Of course, repayment of the whole of the outstanding balance of the loan was not going to occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">But for the amount on deposit, there were no funds to remit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Later that same day, BHPTM informed Finance of that fact in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Two remaining steps were then taken on 23 August 1999 to complete the arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Finance told BHPTM of the write off and the set off against the amount on deposit and the directors of BHPTM resolved to record both the set off and the write off in the accounts of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">That is what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">D. BAD DEBT CLAIMS 
 Against that factual background, I turn to consider whether those parts of the debts written off by Finance in the 2000 year (see [2] above] were each allowable as a bad debt deduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">(a) Legislation
 Section 25-35 of the 1997 Act provides:

<sentence id="s396">Finance contends that it was, in the relevant years of income, in the business of lending money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The Commissioner does not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He concedes the evidence establishes that since at least the early 1980's: Finance did enter into borrowing transactions with third parties (see [13] above); Finance borrowed substantial sums of money from those third parties at commercial rates of interest; and Finance on lent those monies to related entities to fund both operational activity and new projects at a higher rate of interest (see [24] above) thereby earning substantial profits on which it paid income tax (see [24] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">
However, the Commissioner contends that Finance has not established that its activities amount to the carrying on of a business of lending money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">In particular, the Commissioner contends that the evidence does not establish that the activities of lending which in fact existed (see Schedule "A") were activities of Finance and not the activities of BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Put another way, the Commissioner contends that there was no evidence or insufficient evidence that Finance exercised a sufficiently independent corporate mind in respect of the lending activities recorded in its books and records for Finance to be carrying on a business of lending money: see, for example, Levin &amp; Co Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner (NZ) [1963] NZLR 801, 838-839.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">The question whether the business being carried on by Finance was the business of lending money is a question of fact and characterisation: Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 88 FCR 151, 168-169, Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 , 469 and Ferguson v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 , 319-320.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">The essence of a business of "lending money" is not confined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">As Ryan J said in Ashwick (Qld) No 127 Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 853 at [4] , the expression "engaged in a business of lending money" "in the relevant provisions of the [1936 Act] and the [1997 Act] has a wide general application, capable of describing activities as diverse as those of a small pawnbroker with no treasury activities and those of a major national or international banking institution with a complex treasury, perhaps much more sophisticated and intricate than anything which the evidence suggests was engaged in or contemplated by [the relevant entity in the Ashwick litigation]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Moreover, as Mason, Aickin and Wilson JJ said in AVCO Financial Services Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1982] HCA 36 ; (1982) 150 CLR 510 , 527 in connection with the finance company at issue in that case: 
The essence of the business of a finance company ... is the borrowing and lending of money, the rates of interest payable on money lent being significantly higher than the rates payable on the money borrowed, for it is from the difference in the interest rates that the company generates its profit, after making provision for bad debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">There is therefore an important and material difference between borrowing by a finance company in the ordinary course of its business and borrowing by a manufacturing or trading company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">In general the finance company's borrowings provide money which it turns over at a profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Borrowing otherwise than for on-lending or for the repayment of funds borrowed for on-lending, that is, borrowing undertaken for capital rather than revenue purposes, as in [ Commercial and General Acceptance Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1977] HCA 47 ; (1977) 137 CLR 373] , is an exception to the general rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">On the other hand, borrowing by a manufacturing or trading company is often undertaken to strengthen the capital or profit-earning structure of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">A finance company usually borrows in order to increase its working capital which is then turned over at a profit; the manufacturing or trading company frequently borrows to strengthen its permanent capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Finance contends that the concessions made by the Commissioner about the activities of Finance (see [91] above) are, themselves, sufficient to conclude that Finance is in the business of "lending money".</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">However, the Commissioner contends that notwithstanding that on its face Finance was in the business of lending money, one should nevertheless conclude that Finance was not carrying on such a business because "Finance did not make its own decisions with respect to borrowing" and "the evidence [did] not establish that Finance exercised its corporate mind to make decisions about borrowing, particular lending activities, or any of the other activities which might be expected to have been involved in the carrying on of a systematic and organised activity sensibly able to be characterised as a business of lending money".</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">That contention raises a number of questions about the separate existence of a corporate entity and the relationship between a parent and its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">First, does the evidence of its books and records tendered by Finance gives rise to a presumption of regularity or independent existence?</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">This is so in most, if not all, common law jurisdictions: see, eg, Commissioner of Taxation v Bivona (1990) 21 FCR 562 , 567 (citing Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 , 8); Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1122 , 1126 (endorsing the opinion of Young J in Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd v Yelnah Pty Ltd (1986) 5 NSWLR 254 , 267 and stating that separate legal personality persists absent sham, a fa&ccedil;ade, a partnership between companies in a group in fact or law or the creation of a company to enable a legal or fiduciary obligation to be evaded or a fraud to be perpetrated); Hobart Bridge Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1951] HCA 33 ; (1951) 82 CLR 372 , 385; Freeman v Complex Computing Co Inc , [1997] USCA2 466 ; 119 F3d 1044 , 1052 (2 nd Cir 1997) (stating that the corporate form itself gives rise to a presumption of corporate independence and limited liability because it is necessary to encourage business development); American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue [1979] AC 676 , 684 (stating that any gainful use of assets by a corporation is prima facie the carrying on of a business); Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 , 469; see, eg, ss 18-21, 45A, 119, 124, 125, 1305 and 1306 of the Corporations Act (and the equivalent antecedent provisions) and s 69 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The Commissioner accepts this proposition in his written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">That is not surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Secondly, in addition to the facts conceded by the Commissioner (see [91] above), the facts summarised at [9] to [16] above were not in dispute, including but not limited to the fact that BHPB incorporated Finance in 1975 "for a legitimate business purpose", namely "to carry on the business of financier in all its branches both within and outside Australia", and that Finance was registered as a financial institution and short term dealer for the purposes of the Financial Institutions Duty legislation in Victoria and New South Wales: see also Bivona 21 FCR 562 , 567 and the other cases cited in [96] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">What then is relied upon to displace a finding that Finance was a separate legal entity which carried on the business of lending money?</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">As noted, the Commissioner's objection is not so much that Finance does not carry on a business but that it is the parent company (BHPB) that carries on the business of lending money and Finance does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Put another way, that Finance was at the relevant time a "mere conduit" of its parent company, BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I reject those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Putting to one side whether the language of s 25- 35 imposes a requirement of independent corporate mind and decision making when there exists a separate legal entity that is engaged in the business of lending money (an assumption I make in favour of the Commissioner for the purposes of considering his argument), the Commissioner's argument fails for at least two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">First, because that conclusion (ie that Finance was a "conduit" for its parent) "begs, not answers, the question whether the activities of [Finance] are correctly characterised as its principal business consisting of the lending of money" ( Bivona 21 FCR 562 , 567), and, in any event, because the submissions relied upon by the Commissioner are contrary to the facts and no less importantly, contrary to long established authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">The Commissioner's argument directly raises questions about the weight or importance that should be given to the fact that the corporate boards of BHPB and Finance overlapped, that Finance relied upon the board of BHPB to approve capital expenditure on a particular project and that Finance relied upon the processes and procedures of BHPB in deciding the split between debt and equity for each project and, accordingly, the amount to be lent by Finance to the particular subsidiary with responsibility for that project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">It is to those issues I now turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The mere fact that corporate boards overlap is insufficient to defeat the presumption of separate existence: Walker v Wimborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1 , 3-4 (as to the fact that the companies had common directors) and 6-7; see also Seltzer v IC Optics Ltd , 339 FSupp2d 601, 610-611 (DNJ 2004), United States v Bestfoods , [1998] USSC 65 ; 118 SCt 1876 , 1888 (1998) ("It is a well established principle [of corporate law] that directors and officers holding positions with a parent and its subsidiary can and do 'change hats' to represent the two corporations separately, despite their common ownership"); Leo v Kerr-McGee , Civ A No 93-1107(JEI), 1996 WL 254054 (D NJ, 10 May 1996) at *6 ("A significant degree of overlap between directors and officers of a parent and its subsidiary does not establish an alter ego relationship").</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">In fact, there is a general presumption "that the directors are wearing their 'subsidiary hats' and not their 'parent hats' when acting for the subsidiary", so dual office holding alone is not enough to establish liability: Bestfoods , 118 SCt at 1888 (quoting P Blumberg, Law of Corporate Groups: Procedural Problems in the Law of Parent and Subsidiary Corporations (1983) &#167; 1.02.1, 12).</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Moreover, notwithstanding what may have been said by the Full Court in Spassked Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCAFC 282 ; (2003) 136 FCR 441 , 470-71 about active management, Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 establishes that the activities necessary to constitute a business are not onerous or extensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In Brookton , Aickin J (at 469-70) considered that simply accepting a gift of shares and holding them until they produced dividends was enough activity to constitute a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">In the same way, lending one's own funds sourced from a third party at interest and receiving a higher rate of interest on that advance, even if directed by another to make the advance, is sufficient to constitute carrying on a business: see eg Carapark Holdings Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1967) 115 CLR 653 at 659.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The facts in Spassked are distinguishable --- in that case, the entity was interposed and, unlike Finance, did not receive interest on the loans it made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">In the present case, even if Finance was acting in the BHPB Group's interest, as in Commissioner of Taxation v E A Marr and Sons (Sales) Ltd [1984] FCA 213 ; (1984) 2 FCR 326 , 330-31, that is sufficient for it to be carrying on a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In that case, the Full Court held that informal leasing between parent and subsidiaries constituted carrying on of a business even where no income was derived from the transactions in question and the parent retained complete ability to control the subsidiaries' lending activities and profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Here, over an extended period, Finance not only borrowed and on lent money on numerous occasions to a variety of entities at rates of interest (which the Commissioner did not suggest were less than commercial) but did so on loan terms stipulated by Finance and where "the rates of interest payable on the money lent were significantly higher than the rates payable on the money borrowed" (see [93] above), thereby generating a substantial profit: Commissioner of Taxation v Bivona (1990) 21 FCR 562 , 567-9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The fact that the loans made by Finance were made to related entities is not determinative: Bivona (1990) 21 FCR 562 , 569.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">And the fact that Finance might have been or in fact was acting in the BHPB Group's interests is not unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In NEAT Domestic Trading Pty Ltd v AWB Ltd [2003] HCA 35 ; (2003) 216 CLR 277 , 296, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ described the relationship between a parent (AWB Limited ("AWB")) and its wholly owned subsidiary (AWB (International) Limited ("AWBI")) in the following terms:
 
AWBI ... is a company limited by shares incorporated under the Corporations Law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">To a very great extent, its powers, and the powers and obligations of its organs, are regulated by the applicable companies legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">So, for example, at the time of the events giving rise to this appeal, its board of directors owed duties to its sole shareholder, AWB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The content of those duties was to be found in the Corporations Law (Vict) and the considerable body of judge-made law affecting directors' duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">The central duty of the board of AWBI was to observe its constitution and to pursue the interests of the company as expressed in that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">As a wholly owned subsidiary of AWB those duties would, no doubt, have required the board of AWBI to pursue the interests of its parent (and thus, its parent's shareholders) to the extent that those interests were compatible with other obligations of AWBI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">In fact the interests of the two companies coincided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The constituent documents of both AWB and AWBI required that AWBI seek to maximise returns to those who sold wheat into AWB wheat marketing pools.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">That was the position here --- Finance was incorporated on 29 August 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of BHPB "for the purpose of borrowing funds to re-lend to Group companies" with one of its objects "to carry on the business of financier in all its branches both within and outside Australia" (see [9] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The fact that the directors of the corporate boards overlapped and that Finance relied upon the staff and processes of the BHPB Group (for which it paid a fee) does not detract from the inevitable finding that Finance was not a sham, was not a mere conduit, was in a business and that business was lending money in the sense described by the High Court in AVCO Financial Services Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1982] HCA 36 ; (1982) 150 CLR 510 , 527 (see [93] above) and Coles Myer Finance Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1993] HCA 29 ; (1993) 176 CLR 640 , 663-664.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">See also Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Unilever Australia Securities Limited (1995) 56 FCR 152 , 156 and 158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">No other conclusion is open: see, eg, Mills v Mills [1938] HCA 4 ; (1938) 60 CLR 150 , 164-165; Walker v Wimborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1 , 6-7 and Briggs v James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 549 , 577.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">(ii) BHPDRI and BHPTM loans made in the ordinary course of Finance's business of lending money?</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The Commissioner contends that even if Finance's business was that of lending money, there was insufficient evidence to assess whether each of the loans to BHPDRI or BHPTM was made in the ordinary course of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">I also reject that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The loan account provided by Finance to each of BHPDRI and BHPTM was conducted in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 (see [21] to [23], [40] and [65] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">As a result of those loan terms, particularly cll (b) and (h) of the standard loan terms, each loan was for a five (5) month term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">As the summary of facts demonstrates (BHPDRI at [26] to [60], BHPTM at [61] to [87], Finance at [91] to [104] and [107] to [118] below), each loan was made in the ordinary course of Finance's business of lending money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Consistent with the principles in Fairway Estates Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 29 ; (1970) 123 CLR 153 and Franklin's Selfserve Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 33 ; (1970) 125 CLR 52 , each loan was not an instance of lending for an extraneous purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Finance made the loans to both BHPDRI and BHPTM to advance its own purpose of profit-making by lending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">It was not Finance's business to make decisions about debt and equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">Finance's business was to borrow and lend money following the making of such decisions by others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">But for the lending by Finance, Finance would not have derived the substantial interest income and profits from 1986 to 2002 (see [24] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">The "hiccough" in the 2000 year is the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The fact that out of 17 years of continued and successful borrowing and lending money, two projects "failed" in one year (the 2000 year the subject of these proceedings) does not and cannot convert these loans to loans for an extraneous purpose or being other than in the ordinary course of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Moreover, for the reasons set out in section (i) above (see [91] to [104] above), the circumstances in which each loan was made are not the same as or analogous to those considered by the High Court in Franklin's Selfserve Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 33 ; (1970) 125 CLR 52 , especially at 66-67.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Here, it cannot be said that each loan was an isolated transaction of a very special character undertaken by Finance at the behest of BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Each investment was considered by the BHPB board in accordance with usual practice (see [18] and [29] (generally), [26] to [32] in relation to BHPDRI and [62] to [64] in relation to BHPTM), and once approved by the BHPB board, the funding of that investment was determined in accordance with BHPB's Accounting Policy Manual (see [19] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">That portion of the investment funded by Finance was subject to Finance's own standard terms and conditions which provided for Finance to generate a profit on the amount lent to the borrowing entity in each case (see [21] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The projects partly funded by Finance's "advances" (whether to BHPDRI or BHPTM) were the subject of ongoing reviews at regular intervals by the board of BHPB and Finance (in the case of BHPDRI see [36] to [60] and in the case of BHPTM see [69] to [82]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">BHPDRI
 In relation to the BHPDRI loan, the Commissioner contends that the circumstances of that loan differed in important respects from the features which were characteristic of Finance's business of lending money and that its conduct was "curiously uncommercial behaviour".</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The characteristics relied upon by the Commissioner included: that ownership of the HBI project was divided between different legal entities, and the loan from Finance to BHPDRI was not in the ordinary course of Finance's business because BHPDRI was the loss carrier in relation to the HBI project and it cannot have been Finance's ordinary practice to finance projects by unsecured loans to an entity which was expected from the outset to make a loss; the HBI project only satisfied the various BHPB policies relating to capital expenditure because components of the project other than the HBI plant were profitable; the projected returns from the HBI plant worsened over time; for example, the NPV of the HBI plant in isolation was negative $657 million at the end of September 1997 (see [44] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The facts surrounding the HBI project establish, contrary to the Commissioner's contentions, that each loan to BHPDRI was not an isolated transaction of a very special character undertaken by Finance at the behest of BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Capital expenditure authorisation on the HBI project was sought in accordance with the BHPM Capital Procedures Manual (see [28] and [29] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">The initial and subsequent capital expenditure authorisation submissions and reviews outlined the expected returns of the project (see [28] and [30] in 1995, [36] to [39] in late 1996, [41] to [42] in 1997, [46] in late 1998, [49] and [50] in March 2000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">At the outset, in 1995, the project had a payback period of 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">In September 1997, after the completion of a detailed review by Mr McGregor, the conclusion was that there was no case to abandon or slow down the project and that the only sensible course of action was to complete the project as expeditiously and cheaply as possible (see [41] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">In fact, the project then was still forecasted to generate average net annual future cash flows of $557.1 million from year 6 (see [42] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Finally, the decision to close the HBI plant came years after the debt was written off, after production had in fact increased and as a result, at least in part, of unforeseen events or events beyond the control of BHPDRI (see, for example, [60]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">On the question of repayment of the BHPDRI loan, the Commissioner contended that at the time of the initial investment in the HBI project, the return on investment by BHPDRI itself was insufficient for BHPDRI to repay to Finance any loan made to it in accordance with Finance's standard inter-company loans (see [21]-[22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">In support of that contention, the Commissioner referred to two documents (1) the initial capital expenditure authorisation submission of 16 June 1995 (see [28] above) and (2) the McGregor memorandum dated 11 September 1997 (see [41] and [42] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The memorandum prepared on 16 June 1995 by the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM (Mr JK Ellis) that sought initial approval for capital expenditure by BHPB on the HBI plant demonstrated that HBI sales were modest in relation to anticipated returns on the project as a whole (for example, $43 million net operating profit after tax in 2004).</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">However, not only is the value non-negative, repayment of the BHPDRI loan from Finance is supported by a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">First, at each point the decision to invest (or invest further) was taken on the basis of the return on the project as a whole given the facts which existed at the time of each review: see [28] and [30] in 1995, [36] to [39] in late 1996, [41] to [42] in 1997, [46] in late 1998, [49] and [50] in March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Further, the Commissioner's contention that anticipated cash flows would be insufficient to make repayments was calculated using discounted cash flows rather than actual dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In the context of a repayment of a loan, such an approach does not provide a complete answer to the question of whether an entity can repay a loan in real dollars in years to come.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Moreover, selection of BHPDRI as the project entity, consistent with Section 21.19 of the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual (see [19] above), was considered together with the appropriate debt funding levels for such a project (see [31] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Those two issues (the entity and the debt funding levels) were interrelated and considered on the basis that BHPDRI would ultimately make a profit and, until it did, the anticipated "substantial pool of tax losses generated in [BHPDRI" would provide BHPB with the ability to offset income and tax payments in other parts of the BHPB group (see [38] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Finally, it was the uncontested evidence of Finance that had the HBI project achieved the anticipated returns, there would have been a funds flow in the form of additional equity by way of redeemable preference shares or, as stated by Mr McGregor, it was "...usual that the BHPB group entities which contributed to overall profit were rewarded or compensated for such contribution, for example by way of an internal cash flow adjustment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The HBI project posed a series of difficult decisions throughout the life of the investment (for example, these difficulties were the subject of the review conducted by Mr McGregor in 1997 (see [41] and [111] above)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The evidence establishes that throughout the life of the project decisions were made on the basis of obtaining the best possible return in circumstances that were not ideal: see [36] to [39] in late 1996, [41] to [42] in 1997, [46] in late 1998, [49] and [50] in March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">To provide a simplistic example, where an investor makes a $10 million investment, and that investment goes bad, the investor is often faced with limited options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Cut their losses by abandoning the project and recouping little, if any, return on the investment or, depending upon the circumstances, invest further funds in the hope of generating a greater return on the total funds expended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">The course of action adopted will depend upon many factors including but not limited to availability of investment capital, project risk and the period of repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It is a calculation undertaken by investors and lenders on a daily basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">This is what occurred here --- a series of reasonable and diligent decisions with respect to the HBI project and BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The circumstances existing at the date of each review and the analysis of the facts and circumstances relating to each of the decisions is recorded: see [36] to [39] in late 1996, [41] to [42] in 1997, [46] in late 1998, [49] and [50] in March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">To adopt the language used by the Menzies J in Franklin's Selfserve (at 66), each of the advances by Finance to BHPDRI was not "isolated", was not of a "very special character" and did not arise external to the "taxpayer carrying on a business as a money lender".</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">BHPTM
 Similarly, it cannot be said that "each" loan to BHPTM was an isolated transaction of a very special character undertaken by Finance at the behest of BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">As the summary of the facts reveals (see [61] to [87] above), the BHPB board continued to approve and support the operations and although the project experienced difficulties, those difficulties were sought to be addressed at significant cost with the expectation that those difficulties would be resolved or with BHPTM considering other options (such as looking for a buyer with access to different technology and alternative business objectives for Beenup (see [74]) or the "transfer of assets into [BHPTM] to strengthen its balance sheet, and as a result, to assist with the servicing of the [Finance] debt" (see [79] above)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">It was only in August 1999 that the directors of BHPTM reached the point that there were "no other options for improving the liquidity of [BHPTM]" (see [79] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It was only on 20 August 1999, and no earlier, the directors of BHPTM advised Finance in writing of the future operations of BHPTM (see [80] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The directors of Finance then met and after considering the letter of 20 August 1999 together with a presentation on the financial position of BHPTM from Mr Coburn (see [81] above) Finance took the steps that it did on 23 August 1999 (see [86] to [87] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Finance's last advance to BHPTM was 30 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">The Commissioner also contends that if the advances to BHPTM were made in accordance with BHPB Group decisions and processes, then the advances were inconsistent with the BHPB Group's decisions and policies about appropriate debt / equity ratios.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">In support of that contention, the Commissioner referred to the fact that BHPTM's debt / equity ratio was negative until 2001 and that BHPTM had negative shareholders' funds for many years requiring letters of comfort to enable it to operate as a going concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">The contention that the advances to BHPTM were inconsistent with the BHPB Group's decisions and policies about appropriate debt / equity ratios was based on the assumption that it was BHPB's usual practice to ensure that shareholder's funds of BHPB Group entities remained positive and that the debt / equity ratio would be no more than 80%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">In fact, the evidence did not establish either assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">As BHPM Taxation stated in 1996 when considering BHPDRI (see [38] above), "...the selection of a debt to equity ratio is a matter of choice" and "[t]he section should therefore take into account the intended purpose of the company".</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The facts and circumstances relevant to determining the appropriate levels will vary depending on the industry and the purpose of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">The position BHPTM found itself in was unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">As noted above (see [116]), steps were taken to address the difficulties it faced and to reverse the financial position of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">The fact is that none of those steps was successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">In these circumstances, it cannot be said that "each" loan to BHPDRI and BHPTM was an isolated transaction of a very special character undertaken by Finance at the behest of BHPB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">(iii) BHPTM loan bad?</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Next, the Commissioner contends that the principal and interest owing in respect of the BHPTM loan in the 2000 year was not a bad debt when most of it was written off on 29 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The facts relevant to this issue are set out at [61] to [87] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Two questions arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">First, when and how do you assess whether a debt is bad and secondly, was the BHPTM debt bad when it was written off?</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">As the High Court said in G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 75 ; (1971) 126 CLR 177 , 194-195 with reference to the term bad debt, "[a] sum of money comes within the ordinary meaning of those words if it is owed to the taxpayer by some other person but is reasonably regarded as irrecoverable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The process of writing off "as bad debts amounts which are owing but which cannot be recovered" was described by Menzies J in the same case (at 187) as "a sensible commercial exercise and one to which taxation significance is naturally enough given".</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Put simply, whether a debt is "bad" is a question of fact: Dinshaw v Commissioner of Income Tax (Bombay) (1934) 50 TLR 527, 528.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Finance submitted that in determining whether the BHPTM debt was bad when it was written off (23 August 1999), the Court is limited to considering the facts which existed at the time of write off --- in particular, a time when the 1999 comfort letter had been revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">On the other hand, the Commissioner contends that the BHPTM debt could not then reasonably be regarded as irrecoverable and therefore bad because: had Finance demanded repayment before the 1999 comfort letter was revoked, it could reasonably be expected that BHPB would honour the undertaking made in the 1999 comfort letter to BHPTM and its directors; the BHPTM debt remained recoverable under the earlier comfort letters which were not affected by the revocation of the 1999 comfort letter; and if the BHPTM debt became irrecoverable (except to the extent of $11.5 million on deposit), it did so by Finance's own conduct in making or acquiescing in an arrangement with BHPB by which Finance demanded repayment of the BHPTM debt only after the 1999 comfort letter was revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">In rejecting the Commissioner's contentions, it is unnecessary to articulate some general or universal rule about whether, in assessing if a debt was bad at the time it was written off, one is limited to the facts and matters at the time of write off or what Finance described as the "taxable facts": see Bailey v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214 , 217 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Orica Ltd [1998] HCA 33 ; (1998) 194 CLR 500 , 531 and Federal Coke Co Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] FCA 3 ; (1977) 34 FLR 375 , 387.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">In my view, there can be no general or universal rule because the facts relevant to the question of whether or not a debt was bad when it was written off will vary from one case to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">In this case, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that when Finance called for payment of the BHPTM debt on 23 August 1999, it was not paid and it was irrecoverable but for the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">To ask as the Commissioner's submissions require whether in other circumstances or at an earlier time the BHPTM debt might have been recoverable is beside the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">In any event, the matters referred to by the Commissioner do not factually or legally support the contention that at the time the BHPTM debt was written off it was not bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">The fundamental propositions which underpin the contentions of the Commissioner (see [122] above) are that: the 1999 comfort letter was enforceable and operated in favour of Finance as a form of guarantee; and despite revocation of the 1999 comfort letter, the earlier comfort letters either continued in existence or were revived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Both those contentions require consideration of the form and effect of the comfort letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">First, each of the comfort letters was binding as between BHPTM and its parent but created no rights in favour of Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">The cases which have considered the enforceability of comfort letters appear to fall into one of two groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The first common fact pattern is: (1) subsidiary seeks debt financing; (2) outside bank (not in-house financier) agrees to lend provided that comfort letter is given by parent; (3) letter is given to the bank; (4) subsidiary fails to pay; and (5) bank sues parent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Those cases, taken together, establish the proposition that letters in terms not dissimilar to the comfort letters in issue in these proceedings are equivalent to a guarantee as between the party to whom the letter is addressed and the issuing party: Newtronics Pty Ltd (rec &amp; mgrs appd) (in liq) v Atco Controls Pty Ltd [2008] VSC 566 at [7] , [9]-[11] and [13]; Gate Gourmet Australia Pty Ltd (in liq) v Gate Gourmet Holding AG [2004] NSWSC 149 and the authorities referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">These cases say nothing about whether the comfort letters created any rights in favour of Finance sufficient to have precluded it from writing off the BHPTM debt as bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Each comfort letter expressly stated that it was not to be relied upon by any other person (see [66], [68], [71] and [77] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">But even in the absence of such a statement, what "rights" did Finance have as a result of the comfort letters that precluded it from writing off the debt as bad?</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">The Commissioner did not identify any "rights" Finance had against BHPTM to compel BHPTM to take action against BHPB under or as a result of the comfort letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">If, as the Commissioner appeared to contend, they were "rights" Finance had to take legal action against BHPTM to recover the debt, those rights existed independent of the comfort letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Such an action might have resulted in the winding up of BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">If that were to occur, a liquidator of BHPTM would take whatever legal action (if any) he or she considered appropriate having obtained advice in relation to the circumstances which then existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Whether that legal action would have included action against BHPB under the comfort letters (if those letters had been still in force at a relevant time) rises no higher than an educated guess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The second common fact pattern in the comfort letter cases is: (1) entity enters into transaction or publishes financial statements; (2) independent financial or legal adviser issues a comfort letter to the entity stating that it is satisfied that the financials are correct, preconditions for transaction are met or something along those lines; (3) letter contains disclaimer saying it is for the benefit of the addressee only and should not be relied upon by anyone else; (4) third party enters into transaction or purchases shares; and (5) it turns out preconditions are not met or financials were false; and (6) third party sues the independent adviser, claiming estoppel or tortious misrepresentation: see eg Dakota Bank v Eiesland , 645 NW2d 177 (Minn App 2002) and the authorities cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">The issue in those cases is usually whether, notwithstanding the disclaimer, the third party can make out a claim of reasonable reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">This second group of cases also support Finance's contention that the comfort letters created no rights in favour of Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">First, the letters were not written for the purpose of the Finance-BHPTM loan; rather, they were written for the purposes of the directors being able to sign the accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">That is to say, there is no evidence that Finance relied on or was induced by the comfort letters in making the loans to BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">That proposition was never put by the Commissioner in cross examination to Mr McGregor, a director of Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">In fact, during the course of his cross examination, Counsel for the Commissioner asked Mr McGregor in the context of the debt owed by BHPTM to Finance "And as a director of Finance, you didn't consider demanding repayment from [BHPTM] while there was a letter of comfort from [BHPB]?</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">His response was "I --- not that I recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">I am not sure of the relevance of the letter of comfort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">" Counsel for the Commissioner did not identify any conduct which suggested, let alone established, that Finance relied on or was induced by the comfort letters in making any advance to BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider whether any reliance was reasonable and whether that should be determined as a question of fact or a question of law: Dakota Bank v Eiesland , 645 NW2d 177 , 182 (Minn App 2002).</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Secondly, even if Finance had an arguable case for establishing reasonable reliance on the comfort letters, the Commissioner as a fourth party to the letter cannot rely on it as establishing rights in favour of Finance sufficient to have required Finance to have concluded that the debt was not bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">Until there is a curial declaration, any promissory estoppel claim by Finance was only a mere equity: see Daly v Sydney Stock Exchange Ltd [1986] HCA 25 ; (1986) 160 CLR 371 , 387-90, Brennan J stating that a recipient of property pursuant to a contract the product of fraudulent misrepresentation does not become a constructive trustee until the transferor elects to avoid the contract (approved in Lonrho Plc v Fayed (No 2) [1992] 1 WLR 1 , 11-12); Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1, 23, Millett LJ stating that for tracing purposes equitable title does not revest retrospectively on rescission to cause application of trust property that was then proper to be treated as a breach of trust; Giumelli v Giumelli [1999] HCA 10 ; (1999) 196 CLR 101 , 112, in a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ stating that a remedial constructive trust does not necessarily carry with it all of the fiduciary obligations of an express trust and can simply be akin to an order to convey identified property back to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The Commissioner's technical case must therefore amount to the proposition that before Finance was entitled to write the BHPTM debt off as bad, (1) it had to actually bring an estoppel claim and test its validity; or (2) establish that a mere equity (ie a chose in action for estoppel without a curial declaration recognizing the equitable interest) held by Finance in the property of BHPB to the extent of the BHPTM debt was sufficient to prevent Finance from writing that debt off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Both propositions should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">In the absence of other evidence (as was the position here), a contract (in this case the comfort letters) can rise no higher than its respective terms: see eg Agricultural and Rural Finance Pty Ltd v Gardiner [2008] HCA 57 ; (2008) 251 ALR 322 , 346.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">The Commissioner's non-technical case (ie had Finance really wanted the money, BHPB would have paid) is equally difficult to accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">If such a submission were to be accepted, the effect would be that the form of all transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries would be disregarded for tax purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">That is because in any situation involving two wholly owned subsidiaries where one subsidiary cannot on its own meet an obligation to the other, the parent (assuming it is not itself insolvent) always can and will enable a subsidiary in difficulties to meet the obligation, regardless of any legal obligation on its part, provided that there is a commercial reason (ie benefit to the overall group) to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">In that sense, therefore, no debt between two wholly owned subsidiaries is ever bad because, in the words of Mr Coburn, the parent will always "sort it out".</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">I reject that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Having formed the view that none of the comfort letters created any rights in favour of Finance sufficient to have precluded it from writing off the BHPTM debt as bad, it is strictly unnecessary to go on to consider whether despite the revocation of the 1999 comfort letter, the other comfort letters either continued in existence or revived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">It is sufficient for present purposes to note that each comfort letter was for a specified term (one or two years) or until it was revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Upon the happening of either of those events, each letter forthwith ceased to be of effect "except in respect of debts which exist[ed] before that time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">It is at least arguable that the terms of each comfort letter supplanted the terms of the earlier comfort letter in relation to "existing debts" and any earlier comfort letter became irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Finally, when the 1999 comfort letter was revoked, it was replaced by a Deed of Support (see [82] --- [86] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Again, that Deed did not create any rights in favour of Finance that precluded Finance from writing off the BHPTM debt as bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Significantly, the Deed provided (in cl 6) that BHPTM and the directors of BHPTM (defined as the "Beneficiaries") released and discharged BHPB from any claim they might have, or might have had, against BHPB arising out of or connected with the 1999 comfort letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">For those reasons, the existence of none of the comfort letters precluded Finance from writing off the BHPTM debt as bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">(iv) Conclusions on s 25- 35 (1)(b)
 Each of the BHPDRI and BHPTM debts written off by Finance in the 2000 year was deductible under s 25- 35 (1)(b): Finance was in the business of lending money; Each loan was made in the ordinary course of that business; It was not in dispute that that part of the BHPDRI loan written off was bad when it was written off and, in my view, that part of the BHPTM loan written off, was bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">(b) Alternative arguments
 In the alternative, Finance also relied upon: (1) s 8-1 of the 1997 Act in relation to the whole of the bad debt deductions; and (2) s 25-35(1)(a) of the 1997 Act to claim interest on both the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan which it had previously brought to account as assessable income and which was written off in the 2000 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">Given the views I have formed about Finance's entitlement to claim the bad debts written off in the 2000 year as allowable deductions under s 25-35(1)(b), it is unnecessary to consider either of these alternate claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">However, in the expectation that this proceeding will be the subject of appeal, it is appropriate that I say something about each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">(i) s 8-1
 It was common ground that the application of s 8-1 does not require a finding that Finance's business was that of lending money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">It is sufficient if the loss was incurred in carrying on of a business for the purpose of producing assessable income: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro [1926] HCA 58 ; (1926) 38 CLR 153 , 170.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">The Commissioner contended that both the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan were not within the scope of s 8-1 because each was made "outside the scope of [Finance's] business" and each "was an isolated transaction of a special nature".</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">For example, in relation to the BHPDRI loan it was said that the project, as a whole, had a higher risk level than the overall risk level of the BHPB Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">I reject these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">First, as discussed earlier (see [106] to [115]), each loan was within the scope of Finance's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Moreover, neither was an isolated transaction of a special nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">As noted earlier, each investment was considered by the BHPB board in accordance with usual practice (see [18], [29] and [36] above), and once approved by the BHPB board, the funding of that investment was determined in accordance with BHPB's Accounting Policy Manual (see [19] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">That portion of the investment funded by Finance was subject to Finance's own standard terms and conditions which provided for Finance to generate a profit on the amount lent to the borrowing entity in each case (see [21] and [22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">Each of the debts written off as bad was deductible because the act of lending money (subsequently written off) was for the purpose of producing assessable income for Finance: AGC (Advances) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 7 ; (1975) 132 CLR 175 , 197-198 and Magna Alloys &amp; Research Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1980) 80 ATC 4582, 4551 and 4559.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Put another way, money was Finance's stock in trade and loss of that money entitled Finance to an allowable deduction for that loss: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Marshall &amp; Brougham Pty Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 541 , 552-3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Contrary to the submissions of the Commissioner, it cannot be said that only another company in the group would derive assessable income as a result of Finance providing a loan to BHPDRI and a loan to BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">It was Finance that lent the money, it was Finance that charged interest at a margin over the amount it itself paid for funds it borrowed and it was Finance that included the accrued interest on the amounts it lent in its assessable income: cf Hooker Rex Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4392 , 4403-4404; Commissioner of Taxation v E A Marr and Sons (Sales) Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 213 ; (1984) 2 FCR 326 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Total Holdings (Aust) Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 30 ; (1979) 79 ATC 4279 , 4283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Finally, the Commissioner contends that if each loss was made by Finance in gaining or producing assessable income, the claimed deduction should only be allowed in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">I also reject those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">BHPDRI
 In the case of BHPDRI, the Commissioner seeks to apportion the deduction on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of BHPDRI ever repaying the interest and principal on the funds advanced and further, because Finance continued to advance funds without reasonable prospect of repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Those contentions are not supported by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">As the summary of facts records (see [26] to [60], [110] --- [113] above), the project was the subject of approval prior to its commencement and then subject to review at regular intervals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">It is not in dispute that success of the HBI plant was expected to have benefited the BHPB Group as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">Moreover, the evidence does not support the conclusion that there was no reasonable prospect of BHPDRI repaying the interest and principal on the funds advanced at the time of the making of each advance ( Marshall &amp; Brougham (1987) 17 FCR 541 , 549 per Bowen CJ) or that Finance continued to advance funds without reasonable prospect of repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">As noted earlier, in 1995 the project had a payback period of 5 years and in 1997 the project was still forecasted to generate average net annual future cash flows of $557.1 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">The uncontroverted evidence of Mr McGregor was also important in a number of respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">First, that he was aware that the HBI project was expected to contribute to the overall BHPB Group profits and secondly, in his experience BHPB Group entities which contributed to overall profit were rewarded or compensated for such contribution by an internal cash flow adjustment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Further, not only were there capital injections (as recorded in the loan accounts) but there were also a number of reviews undertaken to assess the viability of the HBI plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Finally, the decision to close the HBI plant came years after the debt was written off and as a result, at least in part, of events beyond the control of BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">What that history reveals is that Finance initially provided funds in circumstances where capital expenditure on the project had been approved by the BHPB board and it was expected that the HBI Plant would be successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">However, that did not and does not mean that there was no reasonable prospect of BHPDRI every repaying the interest and principal on the funds advanced or that Finance continued to advance funds to BHPDRI without reasonable prospect of repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">There is no basis for apportionment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">BHPTM
 Further and in the alternative, the Commissioner contended that even if the loans to BHPTM commenced in circumstances where each had a sufficient nexus with the earning of income or the conduct of a business, the circumstances attending the loans changed so profoundly over time that the nexus dissolved so that only a portion of the total deductions claimed by Finance should be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">In support of this contention, the Commissioner relied upon the undisputed fact that the advance at the start of each 5 month term was a fresh advance and that despite: BHPTM having negative net assets and negative shareholders' equity at 31 May 1996, 31 May 1998 and 31 May 1999; by December 1997, the HBI project being overspent and there being substantial spending on items outside the original scope of the project; the carrying value was written down in May 1998 from $150 million to $134 million; the carrying value was written down to nil in February 1999, 
Finance continued to permit BHPTM to draw down on its loan account for project rehabilitation and other costs as well as repayment of $62 million to the ANZ Bank even after BHPB announced that the mine would close.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Consistent with the authorities referred to by the Commissioner ( Fairway Estates Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 29 ; (1970) 123 CLR 153 , 162 and Marshall and Brougham (1987) 17 FCR 541 , 549-50), the question which arises is whether each advance was "made as part of a business of money-lending then carried on by the taxpayer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">It is important to recall that in this context, the taxpayer is Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">As the summary of the facts reveals (see [61] to [87], [116] and [117] above), at the times specified by the Commissioner in [145] above (31 May 1996, 31 May 1998 and 31 May 1999), (1) the BHPB board continued to approve and support the operations; and (2) when the project experienced difficulties, either those difficulties were being addressed at significant cost with the expectation that those difficulties would be resolved or BHPTM was considering other options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Those options included looking for a buyer with access to different technology and alternative business objectives for Beenup (see [74]) and the "transfer of assets into [BHPTM] to strengthen its balance sheet, and as a result, to assist with the servicing of the [Finance] debt" (see [79] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">It was August 1999 before the directors of BHPTM reached the point that there were "no other options for improving the liquidity of [BHPTM]" (see [79] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">It was at that point (specifically, 20 August 1999) that the directors of BHPTM advised Finance in writing of the future operations of BHPTM (see [80] above), the directors of Finance met and after considering the letter of 20 August 1999 together with a presentation on the financial position of BHPTM from Mr Coburn, Finance took the steps that it did on 23 August 1999 (see [86] --- [87] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">In those circumstances, none of the facts and matters identified by the Commissioner (see [145] above) whether taken singularly or collectively support the contention that each advance was not made as part of Finance's business of money-lending then carried on by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Finance's business had not changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">Finance's last advance to BHPTM was 30 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">At all times, Finance provided and continued to provide funding to BHPTM in circumstances where it cannot be said each advance did not have a sufficient nexus with the earning of income or the conduct of Finance's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">As Williams J said in Tweddle v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1942] HCA 40 ; (1942) 180 CLR 1 , 7, it is not the function of the income tax Acts or of the Commissioner "to dictate to taxpayers in what business they shall engage or how to run their business profitability or economically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The Act must operate upon the result of a taxpayer's activities as it finds them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">... [T]he Commissioner is not entitled to say [that a taxpayer] must close down the unprofitable business and cut his losses even if it might be better in his own interests and although it certainly would be better in the interests of the Commissioner if he did so".</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">As in Tweddle , it is apparent that until Finance wrote off the debt as bad, Finance held a genuine belief (which it was entitled to hold) that the loan would be repaid in one of the ways outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Finance was entitled, as it did, to rely upon the past success and expertise of BHPB and BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">(ii) Section 25-35(1)(a)
 As I noted earlier, Finance also relied upon s 25-35(1)(a) to claim interest on both the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan which it had previously brought to account as assessable income and which was written off in the 2000 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Each of these claims fails at the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">They fail because an essential precondition to the operation of s 25-35(1)(a) in relation to each loan --- that all or any part of the sum written off as bad in the 2000 year comprised interest --- is absent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">That requires some explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">BHPDRI Interest
 The relevant facts are summarised at [24] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Finance returned interest income as it accrued and not on a receipts basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">From 1996 to 2000, the total BHPDRI interest income totalled $430,338,836.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">That fact is not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">What is in dispute is the characterisation of (1) the amounts repaid under the loan before 3 May 2000; (2) the amount of $1,845,833,281 written off as bad on 3 May 2000 and (3) the amount not written off as at 3 May 2000 of $346,000,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">The answer lies in Finance's standard lending terms and, in particular, paras (f), (g) and (h) which are set out at [21] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">As those standard terms provide (and what in fact happened), each amount Finance advanced was a separate loan for a five month period: cl (b) and (h).</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">At the end of each five month period, the total of the then existing loan (principal and interest) was rolled over into one new loan: cl (g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">On each "roll over", the then existing outstanding principal and interest was replaced by a new loan comprising a principal advance equal to the total amount then outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The interest owing at the end of each five month period was capitalised and formed part of the principal of the new loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The fact and existence of a "new loan" at the start of each five month period is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">What existed at the end of the previous five month period was, by agreement, replaced by a new loan comprising one amount of principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the loan account numbers 325320 and 326320 were used on alternate five month periods with the loan balance of one account being reduced to zero before the entire sum then owing was relent as principal to BHPDRI using the other loan account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">What occurred here was precisely that referred to by Brennan J in Bank of New South Wales v Brown (as official liquidator of Tom the Cheap (WA) Pty Ltd (in liq)) [1983] HCA 1 ; (1983) 151 CLR 514 , 546 (see also Dawson J at 554-555), namely: 
If the debt is discharged, whether by account stated, by payment or by other means, a liability which takes its place will be of a different character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">It is a novation: the annulment of one debt and the creation of a substituted debt in its place: Scarf v Jardine (1882) 7 App Cas 345 , 351 (per Lord Selborne), Re United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd [1960] Ch 52 , 84 and 86, affirmed in Tomkinson v First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Co [1961] AC 1007 and Olsson v Dyson [1969] HCA 3 ; (1969) 120 CLR 365 , 388 (Windeyer J in dissent, but not on this point).</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Contrary to the express words of Finance's standard loan terms, Finance contends that the reference to "advance" in cl (f) of the standard terms does not include capitalised interest but refers simply to principal amounts lent by Finance to BHPDRI and, therefore, capitalised interest does not form part of the principal sum advanced: Bank of New South Wales v Brown (as official liquidator of Tom the Cheap (WA) Pty Ltd (in liq)) [1983] HCA 1 ; (1983) 151 CLR 514.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">Even if Finance's submission was correct (and I need not decide the issue), it provides no answer to the fact that at the end of each five month period, the DRI loan or loans of principal and interest during a five month period were replaced with a new advance of principal at the start of the next five month period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">Any repayment in any five month period was, consistent with cl (f) applied to reduce, first, the opening outstanding advance and then any additional loans in that five month period in access of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">As a result, as at 3 May 2000 when Finance wrote off $1,845,833,281.34 of the BHPDRI debt: the debt related to a loan of principal of $2,014,599,808 advanced by Finance to BHPDRI on 30 November 1999 on the terms and conditions set out above (see [21] above); in the period from 30 November 1999 (the date of the advance) until 3 May 2000 (the date when part of the loan was written off): 
(a) the only interest charge was a sum of $79,246,114.12 charged to the loan account on 30 April 2000 as "capitalised interest" less the sum of $16,482,163.79 of capitalised interest for April which was reversed; and
 
(b) there were no repayments;
 the total loan balance (principal and interest) outstanding was $2,191,833,281.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">In fact, the general ledger records the loan balance immediately prior to the write off as $2,173,637,557.88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">The difference is attributable to an amount of capitalised interest for the period from 1 April to 3 May 2000 of $18,195,723.46 added to the loan balance on 3 May 2000 and recorded in the general ledger as being charged to the loan account after the write off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">The question which then arises is whether there was any interest previously brought to account as assessable income and which was written off in the 2000 year to which s 25-35(1)(a) could apply?</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">The answer is no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">Consistent with the loan terms and the manner in which the BHPDRI loan was conducted, none of the capitalised interest previously brought to account as assessable income prior to 30 November 1999 was written off in the 2000 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">It had been repaid by BHPDRI or relent as principal by Finance to BHPDRI at the start of each five month rollover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Moreover, the amount written off on 3 May 2000 was, consistent with cl (f) of the loan terms, first applied to the amount of principal ($2,014,599,808) advanced by Finance to BHPDRI on 30 November 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">None of that sum was interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">It was all principal lent by Finance to BHPDRI on 30 November 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">In those circumstances it is unnecessary to characterise all or part of the amount not written off as bad as at 3 May 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">That task is unnecessary because an essential precondition to the operation of s 25-35(1)(a) is that the debt be written off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">This part of the debt was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Section 25-35(1)(a) does not apply to any part of the BHPDRI loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">BHPTM Interest
 Finance's contention that s 25-35(1)(a) applies to entitle Finance to write off the sum of $310,881,702.40 in respect of the BHPTM debt also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">As with Finance's claim in relation to the BHPDRI interest, as at the date of write off (23 August, 1999), there was no sum of interest included in Finance's taxable income which remained unpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">On 30 June 1999, a fresh advance of $336,394,327.20 was made by Finance to BHPTM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">On 23 August 1999, $310,881,702.40 of that loan was written off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">Consistent with the cl (f) of Finance's standard lending terms (see [21] above), the repayment (in this case, the writing off of the loan) was applied to reduce the earliest outstanding advance --- namely the advance on 30 June 1999 of $336,394,327.20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">None of that amount comprised interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">In relation to the balance of the debt, it was not written off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Section 25-35(1)(a) does not apply to any part of the BHPTM loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">E. PART IVA APPLY TO DISALLOW TM BAD DEBT DEDUCTION?</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">
 Finance disputes the application of Pt IVA on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">First, that the Commissioner has no power to seek to rely upon his s 177F determination because he did not issue an assessment or more accurately, an amended assessment, to give effect to that determination and secondly, even if he was entitled to seek to rely upon Part IVA, it does not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">I will deal with the issues in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">(a) Need an assessment to give effect to a determination under s 177F?</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">An assessment to disallow Finance's bad debt deductions (deduction of $2,156,714,984 in relation to BHPDRI loan and BHPTM loan) was issued to Finance by the Commissioner on 23 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">That assessment did not give effect to a Pt IVA determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Finance objected to the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Its grounds of objection were limited to contentions that it was entitled to a deduction under s 25-35 or s 8-1 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Unsurprisingly, Finance's grounds of objection did not address Pt IVA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">On 8 June 2006, in the course of considering Finance's objection, the Commissioner proceeded to make a determination under s 177F(1)(b) of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">The Commissioner did not give effect to that determination by the issue of an amended assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">Instead, he relied upon s 169A(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Was the Commissioner entitled to adopt that course?</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">In my view, contrary to the submissions of Finance, the Commissioner was entitled, in the circumstances of this case, to rely upon s 169A(3) of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">First, the express words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Section 169A provides: 
(1) Where a return of income of a taxpayer of a year of income is furnished to the Commissioner (whether or not by the taxpayer), the Commissioner may, for the purposes of making an assessment in relation to the taxpayer under this Act, accept, either in whole or in part, a statement in the return of the assessable income derived by the taxpayer and of any allowable deductions or rebates to which it is claimed that the taxpayer is entitled and any other statement in the return or otherwise made by or on behalf of the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">(2) Despite subsection (1), if, in a document given with a return of income of a taxpayer of a year of income and signed by or on behalf of the taxpayer, a question is raised: 
 
 
(a) that is relevant to the liability of the taxpayer in respect of the year of income; and 
 
 
(b) on which the taxpayer is not entitled to apply for a private ruling under Division 359 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; 
 
 
the Commissioner must give attention to that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">(3) In determining whether an assessment is correct, any determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment shall be deemed to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">So far as is relevant, s 169A(3) provides that "[i]n determining whether [the] assessment is correct, any determination ... of the Commissioner made ... in connection with the consideration of [the] objection against the assessment shall be deemed to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">On its face, the effect of s 169A(3) is to deem the s 177F determination made by the Commissioner at the time he considered Finance's objection to have been made when the assessment was made, approximately one year earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Finance contends that, notwithstanding those express words, the Commissioner was not entitled to rely upon s 169A(3) and was required to issue an amended assessment to give effect to the s 177F determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">In particular, Finance submitted that: (1) the "assessment" in s 169A(3) only applies to original assessments made in circumstances contemplated by s 169A(1) and did not apply to the assessment in issue in these proceedings; (2) the phrase "determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner" was limited to "reviewable discretions" such as those under s 99A or the former s 80A of the 1936 Act (see Kolotex Hosiery (Australia) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 5 ; (1975) 132 CLR 535 , 539-541 and 576); and (3) the phrase "in connection with" in s 169A(3) imposes not only a temporal requirement but also a requirement that the subject matter (in the present case, Pt IVA) be raised in the assessment the Commissioner was considering at the objection stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">I reject each of these limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">As is self evident, s 169A(3) is not, in its terms, limited in any of the ways contended for by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">So much is conceded by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">It, instead, submits that such limitations should be implied by reference to the history and context of the introduction of s 169A, its interaction with Pt IVA (and, in particular, s 177G) and the general scheme of the taxing acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">None of those matters supports any of these limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">Section 169A was inserted in the 1936 Act in 1986 as part of the first stage of self assessment: Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 1) 1986 (Cth) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">At that time, it was a 'partial' self assessment system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Section 169A was "designed to facilitate 'self-assessment' of income tax returns by making it clear that the Commissioner ... [may] issue an assessment solely in reliance on the information in the taxpayer's return of income": Explanatory Memorandum, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1986 (Cth) (at 65) ("the 1986 EM").</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">In that context, the 1986 EM described the then s 169A(2) (being now s 169A(3)) as a provision (at 65) that: 
will ensure that the correctness of an assessment cannot be called into question because a particular discretion has not been exercised by the Commissioner when making the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">The effect of the sub-section is to deem the exercise of any discretion by the Commissioner at the time of considering an objection against the assessment to have occurred at the time of making the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">(emphasis added by Finance).</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">The fact that the 1986 EM refers to a "discretion" rather than the phrase "determination, opinion or judgment" found in s 169A(3) does not mean that the express words of the section are to be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">It is the words of the statute, not the 1986 EM which is to be construed: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 22 (McHugh J); D C Pearce and R S Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) [2.12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">The further basis on which Finance sought to support the purported limitations was the subsequent enactment of the "later and fuller self assessment measure, namely s 166A, which created, for the first time, a general provision for deemed assessments upon the filing of income tax returns".</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">At the time of its enactment ( Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No 5) 1989 (Cth)), the Explanatory Memorandum described s 169A(3) (at 44 ) in the following terms: 
Many provisions of the Principal Act give the Commissioner a discretion whether to apply a particular provision or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">Section 169A specifies that, in determining whether an assessment is correct, any determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment is deemed to have been made or formed when the assessment was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">This provision preserves the Commissioner's right to exercise his discretionary powers .</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">Contrary to the submissions of Finance, the subsequent introduction of s 166A (and the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied its enactment) do not support the implied limitations contended for by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Both s 166A and 169A are in Pt IV of the 1936 Act headed "Returns and Assessments".</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">If, at the time of the introduction of the "later and fuller self assessment measure" in s 166A, the parliamentary drafters had intended to limit the operation of s 169A in the manner contended for by Finance, you would have expected them to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">They did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Moreover, if the limitations sought to be imposed on s 169A by Finance were adopted, counsel for Finance were unable to identify any "determination" which the Commissioner could have "made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment" to which s 169A would have applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">In other words, if Finance's construction of s 169A were adopted, it would leave the word "determination" in s 169A(3) with no work to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">Such a result is highly unlikely and provides further support to reject Finance's contentions: D C Pearce and R S Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, 2006) [2.22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">Further, Finance submitted that having regard to the history and context of s 169A(3), the Court should depart from the plain words of the section: see McHugh J in Saraswati v The Queen (1991)172 CLR 1, 21-22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">As I have stated earlier, neither the history nor the context of the section supports such a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Alternatively, Finance submitted that s 169A(3) should be construed as not applying at least to Pt IVA determinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">That limitation was said to arise from the language of Pt IVA itself and the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Kolotex .</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">I also reject those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">First, as was noted in Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 , 18-19, the Commissioner after making a determination must take such action as he considers necessary to give effect to that determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">On occasion, no step may be required where, as here, the making of a determination did not have the effect of increasing the taxable income or tax payable under a previous assessment: see the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Stokes (1996) 72 FCR 160 , 174 and Puzey v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCAFC 197 ; (2003) 131 FCR 244 , 265-66.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">In further support of the limitations contended for by Finance and identified earlier, Finance submitted if s 169A(3) applied in a case such as the present, the Commissioner would be able to circumvent the six year limitation period which existed in the relevant years in s 177G(1) of the 1936 Act: cf Woolcombers (WA) v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 66 FCR 66, 73-74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">That contention ignores the express words of s 169A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">As noted earlier, s 169A(3) provides that "[i]n determining whether an assessment is correct, any determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment shall be deemed to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">The assessment is the critical starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">Absent a valid assessment, the Commissioner cannot seek to rely upon s 169A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">If the Commissioner has not issued a valid assessment, that is the end of the analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">If the Commissioner has issued a valid assessment (whether an original assessment or an amended assessment) within any prescribed time limits, then any "determination, opinion or judgment of the Commissioner made, held or formed in connection with the consideration of an objection against the assessment shall be deemed to have been made, held or formed when the assessment was made" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Section 177G is not engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Although this issue does not arise on the facts in this case and is no longer relevant since the six year time limits for the application of Pt IVA were removed by the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Act (No 2) 2005 (Cth) Sch 1 Pt IV Div 3 Item 64, the construction I have adopted would have permitted the Commissioner to apply Pt IVA at the time he considered an assessment properly issued, even though the six year period had expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">Neither the scheme of the Act nor the express provisions of the 1936 Act support a contrary conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">As the Commissioner properly conceded, if the amount specified in the s 177F determination was more than or less than the amount in the assessment under consideration by the Commissioner, the Commissioner could not seek to rely upon s 169A(3) of the 1936 Act and would have been obliged to issue an amended assessment: s 177G of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">That is not surprising: eg Commissioner of Taxation v Stokes (1996) 72 FCR 160 , 174; McAndrew v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 62 ; (1956) 98 CLR 263 , 278 and Woolcombers (WA) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 66 FCR 66, 73 and 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">An increase or decrease in the amount included in the assessment, would require an amended assessment: See, eg, the definition of 'assessment' in s 995-1 of the 1997 Act; s 6-1 of the 1936 Act; Commissioner of Taxation v Stokes (1996) 72 FCR 160 , 174 and Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 , 17-18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">The express words of s 177G(1) (as it existed at the time of these issues) confirms that conclusion --- it prescribed the time limits by reference to "an amendment of an assessment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">It did not limit the ability of the Commissioner to seek to raise other grounds to support the existing assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">That last matter, the ability of the Commissioner to seek to uphold an assessment on a ground not dealt with in his objection decision, subject to questions of appropriate particulars and notice , is well established: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd [1994] HCA 58 ; (1994) 181 CLR 466 , 479 and Lighthouse Philatelics Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 32 FCR 148 , 154-155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">It is a fundamental premise on which the taxing acts are based for three separate but related reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">First, the process of assessment is concerned primarily with the amount payable by the taxpayer and not the particulars which go to establish such an assessment: Lighthouse Philatelics Pty Ltd at 154-155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Secondly, the objection is not against a particular in the assessment but as s 14ZL(1) of Pt IVC of the TAA provides, against the assessment itself: Lighthouse Philatelics Pty Ltd at 154-155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Thirdly, in considering an objection, the Commissioner is not confined to the matters raised by the taxpayer in that objection but has an obligation to administer the Act and "could form the view, based on a reconsideration of the matter, that the assessment should be confirmed for reasons which he had not previously considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">[The Commissioner's] task is to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid ...": Lighthouse Philatelics Pty Ltd at 155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">Questions of appropriate particulars and notice are important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">They are important because Finance further submitted that if s 169A(3) permitted the Commissioner to make a s 177F(1)(b) determination at the time he considered the objection, Finance would lose the absolute right to object to the issues raised in that determination: cf Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation for New South Wales v Brown [1958] HCA 2 ; (1958) 100 CLR 32 , 40 (per Dixon CJ); MacCormick v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 20 ; (1984) 158 CLR 622 , 639-641.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">The alleged loss of the absolute right to object was said to arise from the fact that unless a court orders otherwise, a taxpayer is limited to grounds stated in the objection to which the decision relates: s 14ZZO of the TAA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">There are two complete answers to that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">First, the Commissioner has an obligation to provide appropriate particulars and notice of any grounds upon which he seeks to support an assessment (see Bailey v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214 , 217-218) and secondly, consistent with that obligation, the discretion for a court to permit a taxpayer to seek to rely upon grounds not stated in the objection to which the decision relates: s 14ZZO(a) of the TAA and Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 at 18-19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">That is what occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">The Commissioner provided notice and particulars of his application of Pt IVA and the Court permitted Finance to seek to raise grounds of objection relevant to Pt IVA which, of course, had not been raised in its notice of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">Construed in the manner I have identified, s 169A does not raise any of the four relevant considerations mentioned by Hill J in the context of Pt IVA determinations in Jackson at 18-21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">A taxpayer would retain a right to object (see [175] above); a taxpayer would not lose its right to elect to refer the objection decision to the AAT or the Federal Court because the determination must be made by the Commissioner "in connection with [his] consideration of an objection against the assessment"; the assessment is not in fact amended so that no issue of side stepping time limits arises; and finally, no step is taken after the objection decision as it is the objection decision which is referred to the Court or the AAT: see ss 14ZZ(a)-(c) of Pt IVC of the TAA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">In Jackson , the Court was concerned with events after the objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">No issue of that kind arises here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">Finally, previous decisions of this Court have referred to s 169A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">Although the outcome of none of the cases turned on the proper construction of s 169A(3), each court either adopted a similar construction or referred to s 169A(3) operating in the way I have described above: see Dan v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2000) 44 ATR 338 , 351 and, on appeal, Kordan Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 46 ATR 191 , 198.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Accordingly, the Commissioner was entitled to seek to rely upon the s 177F determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">Finance's contentions to the contrary are rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">(b) Part IVA apply?</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">The Commissioner contends that if the Court finds, as I have, that the BHPTM debt was bad and that the BHPTM loan was made by Finance in the ordinary course of a business of money lending or that the BHPTM claimed deduction was otherwise allowable under s 8-1, then the BHPTM claimed deduction was liable to be disallowed by the determination made pursuant to s 177F of the 1936 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">The Commissioner concedes that his Pt IVA case has a narrow compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">It only arises if by reason of the 1999 comfort letter it could reasonably be expected that the BHPTM loan was recoverable by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">For the reasons set out above (see [124] - [132]), even if the terms of the comfort letters are equivalent to a guarantee between BHPB and BHPTM, none of the letters (including the 1999 comfort letter) created third party rights in favour of Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Moreover, even if the 1999 comfort letter had not been revoked, it could not reasonably be expected that BHPB would honour the undertaking made in the 1999 comfort letter to BHPTM and its directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">As the Commissioner conceded in his written submissions, the most obvious and simple commercial solution was what transpired --- the writing off of the debt by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">That result was not surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">The alternatives for dealing with the failure of the BHPTM project each had their own difficulties, including legal difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Three possibilities were suggested by the Commissioner: (1) that BHPB would provide funds by way of equity or loan to BHPTM for repayment of BHPTM's loan from Finance; (2) Finance could have released the debt before writing it off with the result that Finance would not have been entitled to a bad debt deduction; and (3) release of the debt before and not after revocation of the 1999 comfort letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">In support of the first alternative, the Commissioner sought to rely upon draft memoranda considering such an option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">In relation to the third alternative, the Commissioner contends that if the debt was released before the revocation of the 1999 comfort letter, or without the revocation of the 1999 comfort letter, then the revenue deduction could not have been claimed because the debt would not have been bad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">That possibility raises again questions about the enforceability of a letter of comfort by a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">From a tax perspective, the Commissioner contends that the second and third possibilities would both result in the inability of Finance to write the debt off as bad and a resulting loss of capital that could only be set off against capital gains or transferred to group companies for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">Each of these alternatives is rejected on separate grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">The first possibility suggested by the Commissioner is contrary to the way in which the BHPB Group acted and, secondly, in the circumstances in which BHPTM found itself, likely to be contrary to provisions of the Corporations Law (as it then existed) and the directors' common law duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">The undisputed evidence of Mr McGregor was that he could not recall at any point BHPB (or for that matter another BHPB Group entity) subscribing capital to a non-viable company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">That is not surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">Directors as fiduciaries owe a duty not only to act in good faith but for the benefit of the company: Mills v Mills [1938] HCA 4 ; (1938) 60 CLR 150 , 185 (per Dixon J that "[d]irectors of a company are fiduciary agents, and a power conferred upon them cannot be exercised in order to obtain some private advantage or for any purpose foreign to the power").</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">In determining whether a director has breached his or her fiduciary duty in connection with a commercial transaction, the court in Charterbridge Corporation Ltd v Lloyds Bank Ltd [1970] Ch 62 , 74 stated the question was whether "an intelligent and honest man in the position of a director of the company concerned, could, in the whole of the existing circumstances, have reasonably believed that the transactions were for the benefit of the company".</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">That test was adopted by Cole J in Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) v Greater Pacific Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) (1992) 30 NSWLR 185 and by Hansen J in Farrow Finance Co Ltd (in liq) v Farrow Properties Pty Ltd (in liq) (1997) 26 ACSR 544 , but questioned by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Equiticorp Finance Ltd (in liq) v Bank of New Zealand (1993) 32 NSWLR 50 , where the court approached the issue by asking whether the directors were acting bona fide in the best interests of the company .</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">Regardless of which of the two tests is adopted, adapting the words of Mason J (as he was) in Walker v Wimborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1 at 6-7, neither the facts nor the tests can: 
obscure the fundamental principles that each of the companies was a separate and independent legal entity, and that it was the duty of the directors of [BHPB] to consult its interests and its interests alone in deciding [what that company should do].</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">In this respect it should be emphasised that the directors of a company in discharging their duty to the company must take account of the interest of its shareholders and its creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Any failure by the directors to take into account the interests of creditors will have adverse consequences for the company as well as for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">In the present case, it could not be said that the provision of funds by BHPB or another BHPB Group member (whether by equity or loan) was in the "whole of the existing circumstances" a transaction for the benefit of the entity providing the funding or its shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">BHPTM was non viable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">Providing further funds by way of equity was not an alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Similarly, the third possibility was not an alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">As the Commissioner conceded, it proceeds on the assumption that the 1999 comfort letter created rights in a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">That contention was considered and rejected above (see [124]-[132]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">As a result, even if the Commissioner's contentions that the events that took place on 23 August 1999 (see [82] to [87] above) were artificial and contrived were accepted (a matter I do not need to decide), Pt IVA of the Act would not apply because it could not be said that the debt was not bad in the absence of those steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">The second possibility --- that Finance could have released the debt before writing it off with the result that Finance would not have been entitled to a bad debt deduction --- is a misnomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">As the High Court said in Point v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 7 ; (1970) 119 CLR 453 , if a debt is released, there is nothing to write off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">As Owen J said in Point at 458 "[t]he effect of the release of a debt is to extinguish it, to put an end to its existence and not to reduce the value of it as an asset in the form of a debt owed to the taxpayer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Acceptance of this alternative would result in a situation where notwithstanding that a company in the business of lending money lent money in the ordinary course of that business and then lost that money, it is not entitled to claim a bad debt deduction, being a deduction otherwise provided for by the Act even though none of the steps of the scheme relied upon by the Commissioner altered the fact that the money was lost in circumstances where the deduction was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">As the applicants submitted, the question of the entitlement of a taxpayer to claim a deduction for a bad debt in the current circumstances and in the absence of any allegation that but for the scheme the deduction would not have been available is a matter for the legislature, not the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">The fact that Finance chose what the Commissioner conceded was the "most obvious and simple commercial solution" --- writing off the debt after it was bad and not the uncommercial step of simply forgiving the debt --- does not of itself attract the application of Pt IVA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">For those reasons, I do not consider that Pt IVA applies in the terms contended by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">There is little doubt that the steps in the scheme identified by the Commissioner (namely what transpired on 23 August 1999) were calculated, systematic and taken after obtaining the necessary advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">The fundamental flaw in the Commissioner's case is that the steps in the scheme did not alter the fact that the BHPTM debt was bad and was a debt that Finance was entitled to write off as bad whether the steps in the scheme identified by the Commissioner were taken or were not taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">F. DIVISION 243 
 (a) Introduction
 Division 243 applies where capital allowance deductions for expenditure funded by debt (under Div 40 of the 1997 Act) have been claimed and those deductions are excessive having regard to the amount of the debt that was repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">In those circumstances, Div 243 provides for an additional amount to be included in a taxpayer's assessable income at the termination of a limited recourse debt arrangement: s 243-10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">As s 243-10 goes on to provide "[t]he reason for the adjustment is to ensure that, where [a taxpayer has] not been fully at risk in relation to an amount of expenditure, [the taxpayer does] not get a net deduction if [it fails] to pay that amount".</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">This issue concerns capital allowances claimed by BHPDRI as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">Year Amount 2003 $167,027,482 2004 $160,191,081 2005 $154,884,921 2006 $120,993,150 
These capital allowances were claimed as deductions by BHPB as head company of the consolidated group: Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">(b) Legislation
 Div 243 was inserted into the 1997 Act by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No 5) 1999 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">Section 243-15(1) sets out the basic conditions that must be satisfied: 
This Division applies if: 
 
 
(a) * limited recourse debt has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure; and 
 
 
(b) at the time that the debt *arrangement is terminated, the debt has not been paid in full by the debtor; and 
 
 
(c) the debtor can deduct an amount as a *capital allowance for the income year in which the termination occurs, or has deducted or can deduct an amount for an earlier income year, in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property .</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">Each of the italicised phrases is defined in the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">"Limited recourse debt" is defined in s 243-20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">Sub-sections (1) and (2) are relied upon by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">They define "limited recourse debt" in the following terms: 
(1) A limited recourse debt is an obligation imposed by law on an entity (the debtor) to pay an amount to another entity (the creditor) where the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest are limited wholly or predominantly to any or all of the following: 
 
 
(a) rights (including the right to money payable) in relation to any or all of the following: 
 
 
(i) the *debt property or the use of the debt property; 
 
 
(ii) goods produced, supplied, carried, transmitted or delivered, or services provided, by means of the debt property; 
 
 
(iii) the loss or disposal of the whole or a part of the debt property or of the debtor's interest in the debt property; 
 
 
(b) rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the debt property or other property; 
 
 
(c) rights that arise out of any *arrangement relating to the financial obligations of an end-user of the *financed property towards the debtor, and are financial obligations in relation to the financed property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">(2) An obligation imposed by law on an entity (the debtor ) to pay an amount to another entity (the creditor ) is also a limited recourse debt if it is reasonable to conclude that the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest are capable of being limited in the way mentioned in subsection (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">In reaching this conclusion, have regard to: 
 
 
(a) the assets of the debtor (other than assets that are indemnities or guarantees provided in relation to the debt); 
 
 
(b) any *arrangement to which the debtor is a party; 
 
 
(c) whether all of the assets of the debtor would be available for the purpose of the discharge of the debt (other than assets that are security for other debts of the debtor or any other entity); 
 
 
(d) whether the debtor and creditor are dealing at *arm's length in relation to the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">...
 
 
(5) However, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1) is not a limited recourse debt if the creditor's recourse is not in practice limited due to the creditor's rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over property of the debtor (other than the financed property) the value of which exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the amount of the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">(6) Also, an obligation that is covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) is not a limited recourse debt if, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the obligation to be treated as limited recourse debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">(7) A *limited recourse debt is a non-arm's length limited recourse debt if the debtor and creditor do not deal with each other at arm's length in relation to the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">(emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">"Financed property" and "debt property" are defined in s 243-30 as follows: 
(1) Property is the financed property if the expenditure referred to in paragraph 243-15(1)(a) is on the property, is on the acquisition of the property, results in the creation of the property or is otherwise connected with the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">...
 
 
(3) Property is the debt property if: 
 
 
(a) it is the *financed property; or 
 
 
(b) the property is provided as security for the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">(emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">Section 243-40 provides that "[t]he debtor's assessable income for the income year in which the termination occurs is to include the excess referred to in subsection 243-35(1)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">It does not apply in years subsequent to the year in which the debt is terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">Those years are dealt with in s 243-55 which is in the following terms: 
(1) This section applies where this Division (other than section 243- 65) has applied in relation to a debt and the debtor is entitled to a *capital allowance deduction in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property in relation to a time or period after the termination of the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">(2) The *capital allowance deduction is reduced if the amount that would have been worked out under subsection 243-35(2) would have exceeded the amount worked out under subsection 243-35(4) if the following assumptions were applied in both subsections: 
 
 
Assumptions to be applied 
 
 
(1) That the debt was terminated at the time, or at the end of the period, referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">(2) That the amount unpaid at the time, or at the end of the period, is reduced by any amounts paid under a replacement debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">(3) The debtor's *capital allowance deductions in respect of the expenditure or the *financed property were increased by the amount of the capital allowance deduction referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">(3) The deduction is to be reduced by the amount of the excess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">Finally, s 243-25(1) sets out the circumstances in which the debt arrangement is terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that s 243-25(1)(g) provides that a debt arrangement is terminated if the debt becomes a bad debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">(c) Facts
 The relevant facts are set out above (see [26] to [60]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">As noted earlier, this issue only concerns the loan from Finance to BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">(d) Issues
 For Div 243 to apply, two essential elements must be established: (1) the advances made by Finance to BHPDRI which financed expenditure in respect of which BHPDRI was entitled to deduct amounts as capital allowances must be "limited recourse debt" within the meaning of ss 243-20(1) or (2) (the Commissioner does not rely upon sub-s (3)); and (2) that debt arrangement must have terminated: s 243-15(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">The second issue (that the debt arrangement was terminated) is not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">As a result, the critical issue is whether the loan from Finance to BHPDRI was "limited recourse debt" within the meaning of ss 243-20(1) or (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">It is to that issue that I now turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">(e) Analysis
 Limited recourse debt has been part of the repertoire of financiers for centuries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">As early as 1857, the concept of limited rights of recovery by a mortgagee against a mortgagor was considered by the Courts of Exchequer: Mathew v Blackmore [1857] EngR 262 ; (1857) 156 ER 1409.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">In that case, a plaintiff brought an action to recover a sum of 200 l lent by him to the defendant secured by a mortgage of certain lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">The plaintiff argued that the loan involved in it a liability to pay and subjected the borrower to an action of debt and that the mortgage --- a charge upon the land to secure the debt --- did not affect the right of the lender to sue the borrower for the whole of the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Pollock CB rejected the plaintiff's argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">The Court held that: 
the lending and borrowing of money is like any other contract, and that the right of the lender and the liability of the borrower depends upon the contract between them; and that there was no reason why in the case of a loan of money the ordinary rule should not apply, viz, that where the contract is reduced to writing in order to define and give evidence of the transaction between the parties, that the writing and the writing alone should regulate their respective rights and liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">... and the presence of [a] covenant whereby the defendant covenanted to pay not absolutely but only out of such monies as should come to his hands, coupled with the fact that he was a mere trustee and had no personal interest in the transaction, shewed that it was never intended to create, as between him and the plaintiff, the relation of creditor and debtor as upon a simple loan of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">The distinction between recourse and limited recourse debt was succinctly explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in McLarty v R (2008) 293 DLR (4th) 659 at [29] in the following terms: 
In the context of debt, recourse means that the creditor has a right to repayment of a loan from the borrower, not just from the collateral that secured the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">By contrast, non-recourse or limited recourse debt limits the creditor to the recovery of specified security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">The creditor is not entitled to seek repayment from the borrower should the proceeds from the disposition of the security be less than the total indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">As it is a question of contract, it has no prescribed form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">It depends upon what the parties have agreed or, in the modern world as the following cases illustrate, the creativity of those who put together financing packages and arrangements: see by way of example, Esanda v Burgess [1984] 2 NSWLR 139 ; NZI Capital Corporation Pty Ltd v Child (1991) 23 NSWLR 481 , 489F; Guest v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 65 ATR 815, 819 at [11]; R v New Queensland Copper Co Ltd [1917] HCA 34 ; (1917) 23 CLR 495 , 496, 501-2 (where the Queensland Government advanced money to a mining company that was to be "repaid out of the profits which shall hereafter be derived by or accrue to the company from the working of the said mines" and was therefore unable to seek to recoup the debt from the assets of the company); Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sidney Williams (Holdings) Ltd [1957] HCA 1 ; (1957) 100 CLR 95 , 115.7; Inland Revenue Commissioners v Herdman [1969] 1 All ER 495; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Firth (2002) 120 FCR 450 , 468 and Malouf v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 497 ; (2008) 68 ATR 470 , 477.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">It is therefore not surprising that the drafters of Div 243 sought to define the phrase "limited recourse debt" and to define it in the way that they did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">The issue is whether the loan from Finance to BHPDRI satisfied one or both of the drafters' definitions of "limited recourse debt".</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">In my view, it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">Section 243-20(1)
 The terms of and the circumstances surrounding the loan from Finance to BHPDRI are not in dispute: see [26] to [60] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">The focus of s 243-20(1) is, first, to identify the existence of an obligation imposed by law on an entity (defined as the debtor) to pay an amount to another entity (defined as the creditor).</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">In the case of BHPDRI, Finance's standard terms (see [21] above) provided, in part, that: Loans are to be made up of such amounts and are to be advanced on such dates as are agreed orally from time to time by the borrower and [Finance].</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">Each initial loan and each additional loan is to be for a period not exceeding five months at which time all loans shall become immediately repayable .</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">
(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">The Commissioner does not dispute the existence of this obligation on BHPDRI to repay to Finance the amounts advanced to or drawn down by BHPDRI together with any interest accrued on those amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Having identified that obligation of BHPDRI to pay an amount to Finance, s 243-20(1) then requires identification of the "rights of the creditor" (Finance) "against the debtor" (BHPDRI) "in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest" by BHPDRI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">In the case of BHPDRI, Finance's standard terms (see [21] above) were silent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">Put another way, the standard terms did not address the rights of Finance against BHPDRI in the event of default directly or indirectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">For that reason alone, it cannot be said that the rights of Finance against BHPDRI in the event of default were "limited wholly or predominantly" to any of the matters listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of s 243-20(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">Moreover, as a matter of contract, there is no basis for the implication of a term in the contract between Finance and BHPDRI limiting the rights of Finance wholly or predominantly to any of the matters listed in sub-paragraphs of s 243-20(1): BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 , 283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">Those sub-paragraphs of s 243-20(1) list what might be described as the common or more usual forms of limited recourse debt including: (a) rights in relation to the debt property or use of the debt property; (b) rights in respect of a mortgage or other security over the debt property or other property; and (c) rights arising out of any arrangement relating to the financial obligations of an end user of the financial property towards the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">Property is "debt property" if it is the "financed property" or the property provided as security for the debt: s 243-30(3) (see [199] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">Property is "financed property" if the debt was used wholly or partly to finance or refinance expenditure "on the property" or "on the acquisition of the property", or that "results in the creation of the property or is otherwise connected with the property": s 243-30(1) (see [199] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">Finance's rights in the event of default were not so limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">Finance's standard terms did not limit "wholly or predominantly" the rights of Finance against BHPDRI in the event of default to any of the matters listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of s 243-20(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">BHPDRI's obligation to Finance was unlimited except as to the amount of the debt or interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">Finance had a right to call for repayment of the principal and any interest that had accrued, to sue on the promise of repayment in the standard terms and then to prove with other unsecured creditors in the event of a winding up of BHPDRI: s 555 of the Corporations Act ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Linter Textiles Australia Ltd (in liq) [2005] HCA 20 ; (2005) 220 CLR 592 , 612-13 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Macquarie Health Corporation Ltd (1998) 88 FCR 451 , 472.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">An unsecured creditor has no interest in or right to specific assets: Macquarie Health Corporation at 472.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">Contrary to the conclusion I have reached, the Commissioner contends that s 243- 20 (1) "aptly describes the situation which existed as between BHPDRI and Finance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Notwithstanding that the Commissioner conceded (as he had to) that: BHPDRI's obligations in respect of the loan from Finance were not secured either against its own assets or assets of any other entity; and BHPDRI's obligations in respect of the loan from Finance were not covered by guarantees, letters of comfort or assurances from any other entity; and in the event of default in payment of the debt or interest, Finance was limited to the ordinary rights of an unsecured creditor, 
the Commissioner maintained that contention on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">First, the Commissioner contends that the noun "rights" when it first appears in s 243- 20 (1) must be limited to the rights in paras (a) to (c) and that the rights listed in those paragraphs need not contain any further limitation and, secondly, consistent with that construction of s 243- 20 (1), Finance's practical rights of recovery or recourse against BHPDRI were wholly or at least predominantly limited to BHPDRI's assets at the HBI plant at Boodarie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">The express words of Div 243 (and, in particular s 243- 20 (1)) (see [198] above) do not support the Commissioner's construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">Moreover, if the construction contended for by the Commissioner were adopted it would lead to two absurd results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">First, that one would assess whether a debt was a limited recourse debt not at the time that the loan was made or relevantly varied but when a project fails and secondly, that the debt of every unsecured creditor, regardless of the contractual arrangements between the parties, would be treated as "limited recourse debt".</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">Those results cannot be and were not the results intended by Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">Read as a whole, it is apparent that the definition of limited recourse debt in s 243- 20 (2) was intended to expand the concept beyond those recorded in contractual arrangements between a debtor and a creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">If the Commissioner's construction were adopted then much if not all of s 243- 20 would be superfluous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">Parliament could have simply referred to any arrangement where a project fails and the debtor does not repay the advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">That is not what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">If further support for that conclusion is necessary (and I consider that it is not), it is to be found in the scheme of Div 243 as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">As noted earlier, it applies to cancel capital allowance deductions claimed by a taxpayer and include the value of those deductions in the assessable income of the taxpayer when the relevant debt arrangement is terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Assessment of whether or not the Division might potentially apply to a particular arrangement should be able to be assessed at the time of the original capital allowance deduction, not simply if and when a project fails for whatever reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">Moreover, even if the Commissioner's construction were adopted (and I do not adopt it), there is some doubt about the accuracy of the factual premise in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">Namely, that Finance's practical rights of recovery or recourse against BHPDRI were wholly or at least predominantly limited to BHPDRI's assets at the HBI plant at Boodarie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">A list of the property of BHPDRI was tendered in evidence and included licences and intellectual property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">It was by no means clear that all of that property was located at or connected with the plant at Boodarie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">Financed property / debt property
 Before leaving s 243-20(1) of the 1997 Act, it is necessary to turn to consider the concept of "financed property" in s 243-20(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">As noted above (see [197] --- [199] and [212]), it is a defined term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">Property is "debt property" if it is "financed property" and property is "financed property" "if the expenditure referred to in s 243-15(1)(a) is on the property, is on the acquisition of the property, results in the creation of the property or is otherwise connected with the property": s 243-30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">What is the "expenditure" to which s 243-15(1)(a) is referring and what is the "property" to which s 243-30 is referring?</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">The answer to the first question is straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">"Expenditure" appears twice in s 243-15(1) in subsections (a) and (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">Those subsections direct attention to two matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">First, whether limited recourse debt has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure (sub-s (a)) and, if so, whether the debtor can deduct an amount as a capital allowance (under Div 40) in respect of that expenditure or the financed property (sub-s (c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Having regard to the views that I have formed about the absence of limited recourse debt (see [205] to [218] above), there can be no "financed property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">However, if I am wrong in my conclusion about the nature of the Finance / BHPDRI loan facility not being limited recourse debt, in my view the taxpayers have failed to establish that the property on which the funding was expended was not "debt property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">Put another way, the taxpayers failed to identify the source of funding to acquire the property: see ss 14ZZO(b) of the TAA; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 ; Australian and New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1992] FCA 493 ; (1992) 92 ATC 4630.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">That conclusion requires some explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">The applicants do not dispute that the quantum of capital expenditure on the assets of BHPDRI was recorded in the books of account of BHPDRI and totals approximately $2.16 billion for the period from 1 June 1995 to 30 June 2000..</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">However, it is also common ground that that total is somewhat misleading because it includes amounts capitalised for accounting purposes that were not the subject of a capital allowance under Div 40 and does not include amounts which gave rise to capital allowances under Div 40 but which were not capitalised for accounting purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">The difficulty faced by the applicants in the present case is that the property of BHPDRI acquired by BHPDRI during the period from 1 June 1995 to 30 June 2000 was funded by the loan from Finance and from subscriptions of equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">The applicants submitted that because the property was acquired from "multiple funding sources" it was necessary to compare the change in debt funding of the company during the period in which the expenditure on that property was incurred with the amount of that expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">The flaw in the contention is exposed by the applicants' submission that: 
Where the funding available to [BHPDRI] in a particular month exceeded the capital expenditure, it cannot be concluded that the expenditure was funded by debt if there were other sources of funding that were sufficient to meet the expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">An example of this arises in June, July and August 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">In those months capitalised expenditure totalled $18,774,979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">At that time, [BHPDRI] had available to it $20,000,000 share capital, and the only other expenses [BHPDRI] incurred in that period totalled $162,901.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">... None of the assets acquired by this expenditure was debt property because it cannot be concluded that any of that expenditure was financed by debt, limited recourse or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">One only has to state the proposition to realise the flaws in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">First, there was no and could be no direct correlation between debt funding and expenditure on a month to month basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">Funds could have been supplied in one month from one source and used months if not years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">Moreover, the total capital expenditure recorded in BHPDRI's books of accounts (subject of course to the difficulties identified earlier) was in excess of $2 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">The applicants do not and cannot dispute that the total BHPDRI --- Finance debt by the 2000 year had reached in excess of $2.1 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">At the same time, the total of the other funding sources (whether by equity contributions or otherwise) did not exceed $500 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">Thirdly, contrary to the applicants' submissions, s 243-15(1)(a) requires that the debt be used to "wholly or partly" finance or refinance the expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">And, fourthly, the concept of expenditure and property is itself expanded in s 243-30(1) which provides that property is the financed property if the "expenditure" referred to in paragraph 243-15(1)(a) is "on the property, is on the acquisition of the property, results in the creation of the property or is otherwise connected with the property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">In the present case, the applicants concede that there probably was expenditure entirely funded by debt in some months (eg September and October 1995) but do not identify or even attempt to identify the capital expenditure and, in particular, the nature of the property acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">This form of analysis is, in my view, necessary because of the expanded definition of expenditure in s 243-30(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">That section directs a broad enquiry beyond a mere identification of the property to consideration, inter alia , of expenditure on items otherwise connected with the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">That enquiry is made all the more difficult in the present case, because the "property" in the most general terms consists of numerous items of plant and equipment as well as allegedly personal items of property, some or all of which comprise the HBI plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">On the basis of the current evidence, one can infer from the amount and timing of the debt funding, the quantum of the capitalised expenditure on the assets of BHPDRI recorded in the books of account of BHPDRI, the asset register of BHPDRI and the timing of that expenditure, that the debt funding has been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure (sub-s (a)) and that BHPDRI did deduct an amount as a capital allowance (under Div 40) in respect of some of that expenditure or the financed property: ss 243-15(1)(a), (1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">On no view is it possible for those amounts to be quantified with any precision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">Although I have ultimately decided the question on the basis that the applicants failed to discharge their onus, the answer may in fact lie elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">On one view, the dilemma faced by the applicants supports the construction of Div 243 that I have adopted --- Div 243 was never intended to apply to arrangements such as those the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">The alternative is that taxpayers claiming capital allowances under Div 40 should be in a position to identify each capital allowance, the source of funding for each capital allowance and the inter-connectedness (if any) between items of expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">I can only suspect that the applicants did not undertake that or a similar exercise in the present case because such an exercise was not only expensive but would have inevitably lead to the conclusion that the debt funding had been used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure and that BHPDRI did deduct an amount as a capital allowance (under Div 40) in respect of some of that expenditure or the financed property: ss 243-15(1)(a), (1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Section 243-20(2)
 Alternatively, the Commissioner relies upon s 243-20(2) of the 1997 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">BHPB conceded that s 243-20(2) extends the definition of "limited recourse debt" (see [198] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">The language of s 243-20(2) is important and should be restated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">It builds on subsection (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">It expands the category of obligations imposed by law on a debtor that will constitute limited recourse debt under sub-s (1) where: 
 it is reasonable to conclude that the rights of the creditor as against the debtor in the event of default in payment of the debt or of interest are capable of being limited in the way mentioned in subsection (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">(emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">In reaching this conclusion, the section provides that regard is to be given to: 
 
(a) the assets of the debtor (other than assets that are indemnities or guarantees provided in relation to the debt); 
 
 
(b) any *arrangement to which the debtor is a party; 
 
 
(c) whether all of the assets of the debtor would be available for the purpose of the discharge of the debt (other than assets that are security for other debts of the debtor or any other entity); 
 
 
(d) whether the debtor and creditor are dealing at *arm's length in relation to the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">Subsection (2) is clearly intended to catch those debts which bear no existing legal limitation of the kind specified in subsection (1) but where "it is reasonable to conclude that the rights" in the event of default are "capable" of being limited to those rights specified in sub-s (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">As the applicants submitted, subsection (2) is intended to catch those arrangements which have the capacity to bring about the limitation described in sub-s (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">The form of that capacity is, unsurprisingly, broad and extends, for example, to "any *arrangement to which the debtor is a party".</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">It is an objective test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">Whether the capacity of the kind described exists is, of course, a question of fact to be resolved having regard to the matters listed in paragraphs (a) to (d) of sub-s (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">As the earlier analysis of the cases dealing with limited recourse debts demonstrates there is no and can be no prescribed form for such arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">However, I do not consider that s 243-20(2) adopted or incorporated a test of economic equivalence (such as that adopted in Div 974 of the 1997 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">That was the substance if not the form of the Commissioner's submissions --- that the section necessitates an assessment of whether more than 50% of the property owned by the debtor is related to property acquired with the relevant loan proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">If that were the correct approach (which I reject) the result would be that funding arrangements at the start of a business would be limited recourse within Div 243 and would then fall in or out of the division depending on whether the venture was a success or a failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">The terms of the funding arrangements (whether limited in the sense of sub-s (1) or considered more broadly under sub-s (2)) would simply be irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">That is not consistent with the express words of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">If the drafters had intended the issue to be approached in that manner, they would have said so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">They did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">Moreover, the express words of sub-s (2) are themselves inconsistent with a test of economic equivalence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Under sub-s (2), one of the matters to consider in deciding whether the specified limitation is "capable" of being limited in the manner described is "whether all of the assets of the debtor would be available for the purpose of the discharge of the debt": s 243-20(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">In my view, that matter is not a factor or pointer in favour of the section adopting or incorporating a test of economic equivalence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">On the contrary, consistent with sub-s (1) and the evident purpose of the legislature to seek to define "limited recourse debt", it is to be inferred that where all of the assets of the debtor are available for the purpose of the discharge of the debt (other than assets that are security for other debts of the debtor or any other entity) that would be a factor supporting the conclusion that the rights of the creditor against the debtor in the event of default were not capable of being limited in the manner specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">The interaction between Div 243 and Div 245 provides further support for the rejection of the proposition that s 243-20(2) adopted or incorporated a test of economic equivalence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">Div 245 in Schedule 2C of the 1936 Act was inserted in the tax legislation to address a "structural weakness": Second Reading Speech to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">Prior to the introduction of Div 245, on forgiveness of a debt a creditor was entitled to a bad debt deduction or a capital loss and the debtor would continue to be entitled to deduct losses accumulated before the debt was terminated and to claim capital allowance deductions for expenditure funded by the forgiven debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">In other words, both the debtor and the creditor enjoyed a deduction for the same economic loss in relation to a bad debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">That "weakness" was addressed by Div 245.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">In fact, in the present case, BHPDRI applied Div 245 when it lodged its returns to the bad debt written off by Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">On the other hand, Div 243 (introduced some three years later) is not concerned with or directed to the economic benefit to a taxpayer if a debt is forgiven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">Div 243 is directed to the specific case where a taxpayer is not personally at risk in relation to borrowed funds used to finance an item of capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">In general terms, the measures were introduced to address not a case of double deductions for the same debt (by two different taxpayers) but the situation where a taxpayer obtained deductions greater than the total amount outlaid by that taxpayer in relation to capital expenditure under hire purchase or limited recourse debt arrangements primarily in cases where the balance of an outstanding debt that had financed the expenditure was not paid and the financier could only recover a specific asset on termination of the finance arrangement: paras 2.6-2.9 of the Explanatory Memorandum to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 5) 1999 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">(f) Conclusions about Div 243
 As these reasons for decision demonstrate, Div 243 has no application to BHPDRI's debt with Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">The preconditions to the Division applying set out in s 243-15(1) are not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Limited recourse debt was not used to wholly or partly finance or refinance expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">G. ADDITIONAL TAX 
 As noted earlier (see [5(5)] above), this question of additional tax does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">However, if I am wrong in reaching the conclusions set out above, I do not consider that the position adopted by any of the taxpayers was not "reasonably arguable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">It is common ground that whether a matter is "reasonably arguable" is a question to be determined objectively: Walstern v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1 , 26; Pridecraft Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 339 ; (2004) 213 ALR 450 at [108] - [109] ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v R &amp; D Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 107 ; (2007) 160 FCR 248 , 260-61 and Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 135 ; (2007) 161 FCR 468 , 488.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">A reasoned argument was and can be made to support the contention that the various substantive tax laws should apply in the manner contended for by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">In relation to Div 243, the position is far stronger --- this was the first decision concerning that division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">H. CONCLUSIONS AND ORDERS 
 I do not propose to make final orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Instead, I will direct the parties to confer and jointly file short minutes of proposed orders giving effect to these reasons by 4:00 pm on 3 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">If the parties are unable to agree, they are to submit a joint statement by 4:00 pm on 3 April 2009 identifying: (1) the point(s) of agreement; (2) the point(s) of disagreement; and (3) the respective positions of the parties on the point(s) of disagreement, in which case I will list the matter for further directions or hearing as necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">If further directions or hearing are sought, the parties should consult amongst themselves and then contact my chambers with a list of mutually agreeable dates and an estimated time required for the proposed directions or hearing.</sentence>
