<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Mr Hudson became a bankrupt on his own petition on 21 January 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy became trustee of Mr Hudson's estate ('the Estate') pursuant to s 160 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In November 2001, Mr Pascoe was appointed trustee ('the Trustee') of the Estate pursuant to s 157 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Trustee seeks leave of the Court to distribute the sum of $56,617.50, received by him as trustee of Mr Hudson's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Those moneys are presently held by the Trustee pursuant to an order made by a Judge of this Court, after the moneys were transmitted from New Zealand under circumstances which I do not need to address, that the moneys be held by the Trustee until further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The Trustee proposes to distribute the moneys as follows:
 
 (a) Realisations Charge (3.5%) in the sum of $1,981.61; 
 
 
 (b) Dianne Ellen Hudson, the former wife and only creditor of Mr Hudson in the sum of $5,130.00;
 (c) Sally Nash &amp; Co for legal costs and expenses in the sum of $24,752.94; and
 (d) The Trustee for remuneration and costs in the sum of $24,752.94.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 

3 After the application was filed, a number of adjournments were occasioned by an application made by Mr Hudson in the Federal Magistrates Court ('the FMC application').</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The FMC application, broadly, concerned the question of whether Mr Pascoe was validly appointed as Trustee of the Estate and whether the procedures subsequently adopted by him by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy were effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 10 August 2007 Wilson FM determined in Hudson v The Official Trustee &amp; Ors [2007] FMCA 1357 that the Trustee was validly appointed and that the procedure by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy was effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Subsequently Wilson FM dismissed the remaining matters in Mr Hudson's application, those orders being made on 17 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The Trustee has established service of this application, effected on 10 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On none of the occasions when this matter has been before me has Mr Hudson appeared, despite service by the Trustee of letters informing him of each date on which this matter was next to be before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">As outlined in an affidavit of service of Melanie Cavanough sworn 2 July 2007, Mr Hudson was notified that the matter was to be heard today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The matter was called outside the Court and there was no appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 On 28 August 2007 a fax was received in my Chambers containing a notice of appeal from the decision of Wilson FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The fax was not accompanied by any other documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In particular, there was no application for any stay of these proceedings pending the hearing of that appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Pascoe presses to have the matter determined today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Apart from the number of times that the matter has already been before the Court, Ms Nash, who appears for Mr Pascoe, points to the remuneration and costs that have been incurred by the Trustee to date, which are well in excess of the amount available for distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Ms Nash also points to one of the proposed payments, namely, payment to the former wife and only creditor of Mr Hudson in the sum of $5,130.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The evidence is that those moneys are due to Mrs Hudson as part of a settlement on her divorce from Mr Hudson, by reason of a miscalculation when the amount due was translated from New Zealand dollars to Australian dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 The affidavit of the Trustee sets out in some detail the matters supporting the proof of debt of Mrs Hudson and also the details of the costs and disbursements and remuneration due to the Trustee as part of the administration of the bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There does not seem to be any dispute that the sum is owing to Mrs Hudson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">From the reasons of Wilson FM, it does not seem that there was any dispute raised before him and, indeed, there is none that has been raised before me, as to the quantum of costs and disbursements due to the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 Bearing in mind the costs that have been incurred to date, the fact that on no occasion has Mr Hudson chosen to appear, his apparent failure to respond to any of the letters sent to him by the solicitors for the Trustee and the delay that has been occasioned in the administration of the Estate to date, it is appropriate to proceed today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 The Trustee has filed detailed evidence establishing the basis for the proposed payments and the quantum of those payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I am satisfied that the Trustee has established the basis for the amounts proposed to be distributed and that it is appropriate to pay those amounts out of the Estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The total amount proposed to be paid is less than the moneys held by the Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Act governs the way in which the moneys held by the Trustee should be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I order that the moneys presently held by the Trustee be released to the Trustee and that the Trustee have leave to distribute the sum of $56,617.50 received by him in accordance with the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 As the notice of appeal has been filed from the decision of Wilson FM and as it is by no means clear that Mr Hudson intends or has intended to apply for a stay, I will stay the order releasing the moneys to the Trustee for a period of 14 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Associate:

Dated: 10 September 2007

 Solicitor for the Applicant: S Nash 
 
 Date of Hearing: 30 August 2007 
 
 Date of Judgment: 30 August 2007
