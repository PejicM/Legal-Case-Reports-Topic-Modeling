<sentence id="s0">
 
1 At a community meeting in South Hedland on 25 October 2006 ('the meeting'), 68 members of the Njamal community ('the Njamal members') resolved to amend the description of the claim group on whose behalf this application for a determination of native title is brought ('the first resolution').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They also resolved ('the second resolution') to remove 11 of the 17 persons who currently comprise the applicant and to include three new persons as applicant ('the replacement applicant').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">One of the persons to be removed was Eddie McPhee ('Mr McPhee').</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The resolution, as it applied to Mr McPhee, was said to be made to address his alleged failure to attend meetings and sign documents relevant to the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The current applicant and the replacement applicant have each filed a notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The first notice of motion, filed by the current applicant, seeks orders to amend the claimant application to alter the description of the claim group to conform to the first resolution and to address certain technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In the second notice of motion, the nine members constituting the replacement applicant seek orders that they replace the current applicant, in accordance with the second resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr McPhee opposes the orders sought in the second motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He says that the meeting was ' flawed '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">No other person opposes the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr McPhee does not oppose the orders sought in the first notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The first motion 
 
3 These claimant proceedings are brought under s 61(1) of the Act which provides that the persons authorised by all the persons who hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the claimed native title ('the claim group') may (relevantly) bring the application (ss 253 and 61 (1) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The persons who are so authorised are, jointly, the ' applicant ' (s 61(2)(c) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 The applicant relies on O 13 r 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') which permits the amendment of ' any document in the proceeding '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">That applies to a native title determination application, subject to the constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B of the [2003] FCA 1423 ; Act ( Anderson v Western Australia (2003) 134 FCR 1 at [36] per French J; Strickland v Western Australia [1999] FCA 221 ; (1999) 89 FCR 117 at [9] per Nicholson J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The constraints imposed by ss 64 and 66B are not relevant to the first motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 The amendment to alter the claim group description is explained as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The 17 persons currently named as applicant bring these proceedings ' on behalf of the Njamal people '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">However, in the application on the Court file, the claim group as described in Schedule A is identical to the members of the current applicant, the same 17 people ('the current claim group').</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is no explanation why this is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Anthropological evidence is to the effect that the Njamal people are not limited to the current claim group and that meetings of the Njamal people to consider the native title claim have never been so restricted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The unchallenged evidence is that the Njamal people, including those named as the current applicant-current claim group and their advisors, have always understood that the correct claim group was to be the larger group of Njamal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is that larger group that has consistently attended community meetings and made decisions relevant to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 The proposed amendment is to extend the members of the claim group and properly and more accurately to identify them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Members of the current applicant and of the proposed replacement applicant and the Njamal people present at the meeting have approved of the amended description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 Under traditional Njamal law and custom, membership of the claim group can be described by way of descent from Njamal apical ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The proposed amendment is to replace the description in Schedule A with the following description ('the replacement claim group'): 
 
 'The native title claim group, on whose behalf this application is brought consists of: 
 
 (a) the descendants of: 
 
 Ngurrpangu / Sally; 
 Yirlkurani / William Ball; 
 Pularji and Minparingu / Daisy; 
 Walykunpangu; 
 Mujayakirrirri; 
 Mikarnipirti; 
 Kutjikurtapa / Fred Mitchell; 
 Putangaja; 
 Jarlapangu / Billy Ball; 
 Wijiringu; 
 Yirapinya; 
 Ngamalykarinya; 
 Wanarngykuranya / Tommy; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the following incorporated members: 
 Reggie Malana; and 
 Colin Malana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">' 
 
 

8 The replacement claim group is based on the anthropological research carried out to date identifying those Njamal persons who can claim native title rights and interests in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is also the description that was discussed and approved at the meeting, prior to passage of the first resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 The amendment is consistent with the scheme of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The proper identification of the claim group is a matter of fundamental importance to the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Schedule A of the application should be amended to identify the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">10 The proposed technical amendments, broadly and in summary:
 
 &#8226; correct typographical errors; 
 &#8226; exclude category B past and intermediate period acts wholly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of any native title rights or interests;
 &#8226; exclude a claim of native title rights and interests conferring exclusive rights over areas in relation to which a previous non-exclusive possession act has been done; 
 &#8226; distinguish between rights and interests claimed over areas where a claim of exclusive possession can be recognised and areas where such a claim cannot be recognised, in accordance with s 190B(9)(c) of the Act; 
 &#8226; delete certain rights and interests claimed, to reflect decisions of the High Court ( Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1) and the Full Federal Court ( Northern Territory v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135) ; and
 &#8226; better address the requirements of the Act (ss 62(2)(e) and 190B(5)) in describing the native title rights and interests claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">

11 The technical amendments do not affect the substantive rights and interests claimed and they are supported by the first respondent, the State of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">There is no evidence that the technical amendments were approved by the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Subject to the procedural matters that I will later outline, however, it is appropriate that the application be so amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The second motion 
 
12 In the second motion, the replacement applicant applies for orders that it replace the current applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The replacement involves the removal of 11 persons and the addition of three new persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Of the 11 persons proposed to be removed, three are deceased and seven consent to being removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The other is Mr McPhee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">There is no opposition to the removal of the deceased applicant members or to the addition of the proposed new members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Six members of the current applicant will remain members of the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">13 Section 61(1) of the Act requires that the applicant be authorised by the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The ground on which the order is sought is that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to bring the application (subs 66B(1)(a)(i)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The replacement applicant asserts that it is so authorised (subs 66B(1)(b) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">14 Section 66B of the Act provides for a procedure for the replacement of the applicant ( Chapman on behalf of the Wakka Wakka People # 2 v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 597 per Kiefel J at [2]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Under subs 66B(1)(a)(i), members of a claim group who seek to replace an existing applicant must relevantly establish ( Daniel v The State of Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 per French J at [17]) that:
 
(1) There is a claimant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">(2) Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 (3) The persons to be replaced are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">(4) The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">

15 There is a claimant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">All of the members of the replacement applicant are members of the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">All but three of them are also members of the current applicant and current claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Upon the making of the orders sought in the first motion, the second criterion will be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 As to the remaining criteria, s 251B of the Act governs when a person (or persons) is authorised by all of the persons in the claim group and applies in determining when a person is authorised for the purposes of s 66B ( Daniel at [14]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Authorisation may be in accordance with a process of decision-making according to traditional laws and customs (s 251B(a) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Where there is no such process, it may be in accordance with a process agreed and adopted by the claim group (s 251B(b) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">17 Whether there is authorisation for the purposes of s 66B in any given case is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In the present case, the evidence is that there is no precise process or cultural precedent under the traditional laws and customs of the Njamal people that must be followed for decisions of the kind contemplated by s 66B of the Act or otherwise for authorising claim group members to represent the group as applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Decisions as to the authorisation or removal of applicants are not part of Njamal traditional law and culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Instead, the Njamal people have agreed to and adopted a process of making decisions (s 251B(b) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Pursuant to that process, decisions are made by resolution or consensus at community meetings organised by the Pilbara Native Title Services ('PNTS').</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">All known Njamal people are included on a mailing list and invited by letter to attend such meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The mailing list has been compiled with the input of anthropologists who have been involved in researching the claims and genealogies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Notices are also sent to communities where Njamal people reside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Meetings have been called and held where families are represented and individuals or families with particular interest or authority in relation to the decisions being contemplated are present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Decisions at those meetings have been made by consensus and by way of formal resolutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">18 Although it is not possible for every member of the claim group to attend each community meeting, the group regards itself as bound by the decisions of those who are present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Major decisions have been made over a number of years in this manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">At such meetings of the larger Njamal community decisions have been made to form a working group to deal with day to day claim group business and to participate in surveys in Njamal country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Njamal people chosen at these meetings are not all members of the current claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">19 Community meetings have become the accepted way of making major decisions on matters such as the claim areas, authorisation of the applicant and major future act decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Where there is not a reasonably representative group of people at a community meeting or insufficient attendees, the persons present may decide that it is inappropriate for a decision to be made at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The resolutions at the meeting were in accordance with the decision-making process previously used and, I am informed, also used to authorise the current applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 The sole agenda items at the meeting were ' claim group description ' and ' replacement of the applicants '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Following discussion of each item, the members present resolved:
 
 &#8226; to amend the claim group description (the first resolution);
 &#8226; no longer to authorise the current applicant ' as a group ' to make the application in these proceedings or to deal with matters in relation to it;
 &#8226; to remove 11 of the 17 persons who currently comprise the applicant and to include three new persons as applicant (the second resolution);
 &#8226; to authorise the replacement applicant to be the applicant in these proceedings and to deal with matters related to the application in accordance with decisions of the Njamal native title claim group through community meetings; 
 &#8226; to authorise the replacement applicant to bring an application in this Court to replace the current applicant and to authorise them to instruct PNTS to act for them, or to organise or appoint legal representatives to act for them, in relation to that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">

21 Each resolution was passed unanimously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">22 The adoption of a process of decision-making does not require all members of the claim group to be involved in making the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Nor does it require a unanimous vote ( Lawson v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 per Stone J at [25]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The members of the claim group should be given every reasonable opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It cannot, logically, be the case that all, in the sense of each and every member of the claim group must be involved in and agree to the proposed decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">That would, as has been pointed out in Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378 at [33] per O'Loughlin J include persons who are unable to participate by reason of age, mental capacity or unknown whereabouts and would permit an individual to prevent the progress of a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">To cancel a meeting merely because one member is unable to attend would also constitute a waste of limited resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The costs of holding a Njamal community meeting can exceed $13,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">23 Section 251B of the Act reflects the communal character of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The authorisation process must be able to be traced to a decision of the native title claim group who adopt that process ( Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760 per French J at [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">A meeting which purports to authorise the replacement of applicants should be attended by persons ' fairly representative of the native title claim [group] concerned ' ( Bolton at [46]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">There is no suggestion that this was not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The evidence of Jodi Neale, the anthropologist who attended the meeting and on whose research the replacement claim group description is based, is that those in attendance were reasonably representative of the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">24 In summary, the resolutions were made by a group of Njamal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Those persons were sufficiently representative of the replacement claim group and made the resolutions in accordance with an agreed process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It follows that the decision-making processes required by s 66B have been proved ( Bolton at [42]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">25 By s 64(5) of the Act, if a claimant application is amended to replace the applicant with a new applicant, the amended application must be accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the new applicant attesting to the matters specified in subss 64(5)(a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Each of the replacement applicants has sworn and filed an affidavit and I am satisfied that s 64(5) has been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Mr McPhee's complaint 
 
26 The only person opposing this application to replace the applicant is Mr McPhee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He complains that the meeting was ' flawed ' because the members in attendance were not properly informed of matters relevant to their decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Mr McPhee submits that the Court should not, as a matter of discretion, make orders to replace the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr McPhee did not attend the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">27 Mr Bower, who appears for Mr McPhee, submits that it was not put to the meeting that the reason why Mr McPhee had not signed or had delayed signing certain agreements was because he had genuine concerns as to the appropriateness of those agreements and the information given to the claim group, that he had and continues to have genuine concerns as to the conduct of the native title claim and that the reason he had not attended past meetings was because of insufficient notice and inability to take time off work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">All of those matters had been conveyed by Mr McPhee or his solicitor to PNTS which represents and advises the applicant and the Njamal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr McPhee's concerns extended to the commercial attractiveness of the agreements and to traditional matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There is no suggestion that those concerns are other than genuinely held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">28 Mr Bower relies on the evidence filed by the replacement applicant as to the procedure adopted at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">PNTS staff explained to those in attendance that the purpose of the meeting was to change the claim group description and amend the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Each resolution was projected on to a white board, read aloud and its effects explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The claim group then broke into informal discussions and any suggested amendments were incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There is no evidence that the claim group was informed at the meeting of the reasons why Mr McPhee had not signed agreements in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Rather, the minutes of the meeting record that: 
 
 &#8226; ' It was noted that some registered applicants have opted to resign and that Angus Abdullah lacks sufficient capacity to continue as an applicant ';
 &#8226; ' It was further noted that Eddie McPhee has repeatedly failed to properly perform (sic) the role of applicant, including refusing to sign documents that the Njamal community has agreed to and authorised the applicant to sign '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">

29 Present at the meeting of 25 October 2006 were members of Mr McPhee's family, including his oldest living relatives which, in turn, included the primary acknowledged family elder, his uncle Johnson Taylor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Johnson Taylor is a member of the current applicant and of the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">30 Mr Bower submits that the Njamal members cannot have been in a position properly to exercise their rights and obligations as voting members in Mr McPhee's absence without being provided with complete and accurate information relevant to the agenda items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">That would have included information concerning the reasons communicated to PNTS as to why Mr McPhee had delayed in signing agreements in the past and "the essence" of the matters raised in letters to PNTS from Mr McPhee and his solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">31 Mr McPhee was served with notice of the meeting on 11 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">That notice stated specifically that his removal as an applicant would be discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">There is no evidence that Mr McPhee asked PNTS to bring his letters or his concerns to the attention of community members present at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">However, Mr Bower submits that, where PNTS accepted the responsibility for organising the meeting, it was incumbent on it to convey those concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">32 Ms Tan, who appears for the current applicant and the replacement applicant, submits that there is a long history of Mr McPhee raising concerns with the Njamal people, including members of the current claim group and the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In her submission, there was no reason for those concerns to be recited again at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">She points out that letters from Mr McPhee and his solicitors to PNTS have been read out or discussed at meetings in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">For example, the minutes of a meeting between members of the Njamal community and Consolidated Minerals Ltd held on 26 August 2003 record:
 
 ' Pam indicated to the group that she had received a letter from Eddie McPhee noting that he has not signed the Newcrest Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Pam required instructions as to how to deal with Eddie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Pam had informed Eddie that the applicants have to do what the claim group says and warned him that Nyamal (sic) may remove him from the list of applicants if he did not follow the claim group's instructions ... Pam said that that Eddie is getting separate advice from a lawyer ... [t] he group instructed Pam that they did not want copies of the Report and the minutes forwarded to Eddie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">They are to stay in the file prepared by Pam and available at each of the meetings ... The group asked Pam to write to Eddie informing him of how disappointed they are that he has not signed the Newcrest Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">They intend to hold a claimant meeting to discuss his removal as an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">' 
 

33 I am now asked by Mr Bower to draw the inference that, had the meeting been properly called and had the members of the claim group who attended the meeting been informed of Mr McPhee's concerns, they might not have passed the resolution or agreed to remove him as a member of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">34 There is no dispute that the members of the claim group are entitled to determine the members of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">35 There are a number of reasons why the inference sought by Mr McPhee should not be drawn:
 
 &#8226; Members of the replacement claim group who were present at the meeting included members of Mr McPhee's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">They voted to remove Mr McPhee and have filed affidavits in support of the proposed replacement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">&#8226; Mr McPhee has had ample opportunity to notify the members of the replacement claim group, including members of his family, of his concerns and the reasons why he did not attend the meeting and did not sign or delayed signing previous agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Mr McPhee has been present at meetings where he could and did do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">&#8226; Mr McPhee accepts that at least some members of the replacement claim group would, by now, be aware of his position and the matters and concerns that he raised with PNTS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">&#8226; None of the members of the replacement claim group have supported Mr McPhee's opposition to the second motion or sought to change the decisions reached and resolutions passed at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">

36 Other factors relevant to the exercise of discretion are:
 
 &#8226; Mr McPhee will remain a member of the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">&#8226; Mr McPhee had previously been removed as a member of a Njamal working party, a group authorised to negotiate with other parties in the proceedings and other parties interested in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">&#8226; Steps were first taken to remove Mr McPhee as a member of the applicant in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">

37 Mr Bower likens the meeting to a meeting of a voluntary association where one of the members is improperly treated and misrepresented to the other members of the association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He submits that the principles applicable at common law to voluntary associations, for example that every member is required to act reasonably in respect of each other, are applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I do not accept the analogy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">38 The replacement applicant has established that:
 
 &#8226; There has been a meeting of the Njamal community which has formally agreed to remove certain members of the current applicant and to add certain additional members, to form the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">&#8226; The persons in attendance at the meeting were reasonably representative of the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">&#8226; Some of the members of the current applicant are deceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">&#8226; The proposed new members have each consented to become members of the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">&#8226; The claimants at the meeting agreed unanimously to the proposed course of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

39 The withdrawal and conferring of authority for the purposes of a s 66B application must be shown to flow from the claim group ( Bolton at [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Once this is established, the actions of the claim group and the means by which it makes decisions is a matter for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">It is not for the Court to interfere with decisions reached in accordance with the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It is not for the Court to consider the wisdom of those decisions or whether, in this case, there is merit in Mr McPhee's concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It is for him to communicate those concerns, if he wishes to do so, to the other claimants and for the applicant, on receipt of instructions from the claim group, to act as authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Upon the making of the orders sought by the first motion, the terms of s 66B of the Act will be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Court has a discretion as to whether it should exercise its power under s 66B (subs 66B(2) of the Act; Daniel at [18]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">That discretion should be exercised to make the orders sought by the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Procedural matters 
 
40 Section 62A of the Act relevantly provides that the applicant in a claimant application may deal with all matters arising under the Act in relation to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That includes the amendment of the application from time to time ( Drury v Western Australia [2000] FCA 132 ; (2000) 97 FCR 169 at [12] per French J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">41 The procedural chronology is as follows:
 
 &#8226; The description of the replacement claim group is agreed (25 October 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">&#8226; The replacement claim group resolves that the current applicant ' as a group ' is no longer authorised to deal with the application (25 October 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">&#8226; The replacement applicant is authorised by the replacement claim group (25 October 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">&#8226; The first motion is filed (27 February 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It lists the replacement applicant as the party moving the Court for orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">&#8226; The first motion is amended to specify the current applicant as the moving party (28 February 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">&#8226; The Court is moved for orders by the current applicant pursuant to the first motion as amended (21 March 2007 and 28 May 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">

42 A question arises as to whether the current applicant can move the Court for orders to amend the application in these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">On one view, until the making of orders to replace the current applicant, it remains the applicant in the proceedings and may deal with the application and bring the first motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">On the other hand, however, the unchallenged evidence is that the replacement claim group withdrew the current applicant's authority to deal with the application at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">That would, on its face, include a revocation of the authority to file and prosecute a notice of motion to amend the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">43 Ms Tan submitted at the hearing that orders could not be made pursuant to s 66B of the Act to replace the current applicant with the replacement applicant until the claim group is amended to name the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">That is because the authorisation of the replacement applicant was by the replacement claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">44 The reasons for judgment were published in draft on 16 July 2007 to enable the parties to consider these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Further submissions and evidence were filed on 30 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In my view, the position is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">45 The current applicant in the proceedings consists of the named persons on behalf of the Njamal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Section 66B of the Act provides that one or more members of the claim group can apply to the Court for an order that a member or members jointly of the claim group replace the current applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">One of the bases of such an application is that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it (subs 66B(1)(a)(i) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">That means that, at the time of the application, that lack of authorisation has already occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">46 For the reasons already given, I am satisfied that the current applicant is no longer so authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The moving party in the application to replace the current applicant is the replacement applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Until the replacement occurs, the replacement applicant consists of a group of members of the native title claim group, some of whom are members of the current applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">That is, one or more members of the claim group are making the application to replace the current applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">47 The additional requirement of subs 66B(1)(b) is that the member or members are authorised by the claim group to make the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">For the reasons already given, that subsection has been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">48 Until such time as the order for replacement is made, the current applicant remains the applicant in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The fact that its authorisation has been withdrawn does not affect its status so far the as the proceedings are concerned, until such time as it is removed as a party to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Indeed, the fact that authorisation of an applicant may have been withdrawn is envisaged by s 66B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It is not suggested in that section or in the Act that such withdrawal of authorisation affects the status of the applicant as a party in the proceedings prior to an order being made by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">It is not itself a condition of continuation as an applicant nor is it a statutory element of the right to apply to amend claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The right to bring an application under s 66B is expressly given to the members of the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">49 I have had regard to the evidence of the process of authorisation and the fact that the amendment sought in the first motion is, in part, to ensure the correct description of the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The evidence is that it was the intention of the Njamal members voting at the meeting to correct the description of the claim group to reflect properly the Njamal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The evidence is also that it was not the intention of those voting at the meeting to "de-authorise" the current applicant until the order for replacement took effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current applicant may move the Court for orders to amend the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It is also, in my view, appropriate to make the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Service on the respondents 
 
50 Ms Tan submits that it is appropriate that, in lieu of service of the motions and affidavits in support, the Court orders that the applicant serves a copy of the orders on the respondents within 28 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">A further order is proposed that the applicant provide a copy of the amended application to any respondent who requests it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">As Ms Tan points out, the subject matter of the motion for orders pursuant to s 66B is not directly relevant to the respondent parties and does not affect their interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">51 There are in excess of 100 respondents to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Many of the respondents do not attend directions hearings or, I am informed, otherwise take an active role in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">To require service of the first and second motions and the supporting documentation on all of the respondent parties would involve significant and unnecessary expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">It is appropriate that the orders sought by Ms Tan be made, but that, in addition, the applicant provides the respondent parties with a reference to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Conclusion 
 
52 The application should be amended as sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It is also appropriate that the replacement applicant replace the current applicant in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Njamal members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>
