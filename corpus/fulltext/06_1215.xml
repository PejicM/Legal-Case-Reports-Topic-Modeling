<sentence id="s0">
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') brings proceedings against three corporations and three individuals claiming relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In the proceedings, the Commission alleges contravening conduct by the three corporate respondents and accessorial liability for the contraventions by the three individual respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Commission seeks various declarations, pecuniary penalties, injunctions and other orders against the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The parties to the proceedings entered into negotiations and they have agreed to settle the proceedings.</sentence>

<sentence id="s6">The issue before me is whether the Court has the power to accept the undertakings proffered by the respondents and whether it is appropriate to accept the undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Five undertakings are proffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The first undertaking is proffered by the three corporate respondents and, for reasons I will give, the Court has the power to accept the undertaking and, in my opinion, it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The second undertaking is proffered by the individual respondents and again, for reasons I will give, the Court has the power to accept the undertaking and it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The third undertaking is proffered by the first corporate respondent (Auspine Limited) and is to the effect that the first corporate respondent will implement the recommendations contained in the March 2006 'Report on the Implementation and Effectiveness of Auspine Ltd's Trade Practices Compliance Program'.</sentence>

<sentence id="s15">For reasons I will give, the Court has the power to accept the undertaking and, in my opinion, it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In the circumstances, I do not propose to make any orders at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The undertakings and orders are part of an overall settlement.</sentence>

<sentence id="s96">The Orders and Undertakings Before considering each undertaking it is appropriate to make some general points about the Court's power to accept undertakings and the exercise of that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">First, the Court's power to accept an undertaking is subject to the same limitations that apply to its power to grant an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In other words, the Court cannot accept an undertaking in terms which go beyond the Court's power to grant an injunction in similar terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">This proposition is well-established: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 per Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ at 164-165 (' Thomson ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">An undertaking to the Court is given in lieu of an injunction and the remedies for breach of an undertaking are the same as those for breach of an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In Thomson , Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ said (at 165): 
 
 an undertaking is given in lieu of an injunction and is enforceable in like manner, the principles which govern the grant of an injunction by a court must guide it in deciding whether it should accept an undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Limitations which affect the court's jurisdiction or power to grant a final injunction must be observed in the acceptance of an undertaking when it is offered as a substitute for a final injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">' 
 
 In a case such as this one where the contravening conduct is neither admitted nor proved, the Court's power to grant an injunction is contained in s 80(1AA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The relevant provisions of s 80, including that subsection, are as follows: 
 
 Subject to subsections (1A), (1AAA) and (1B), where, on the application of the Commission or any other person, the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes or would constitute: 
 
 a contravention of any of the following provisions: 
 
 a provision of Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC; 
 
 section 75AU or 75AYA; 
 
 attempting to contravene such a provision; 
 
 aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene such a provision; 
 
 inducing, or attempting to induce, whether by threats, promises or otherwise, a person to contravene such a provision; 
 
 being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of such a provision; or 
 
 conspiring with others to contravene such a provision; 
 
 Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">... 
 
 Where an application for an injunction under subsection (1) has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
 

...
 
 
 The power of the Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised: 
 
 whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; 
 
 whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; and 
 
 whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first-mentioned person engages in conduct of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">... 
 
 The power of the Court to grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or thing may be exercised: 
 
 whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing; 
 
 whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; and 
 
 whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first-mentioned person refuses or fails to do that act or thing.</sentence>

 Secondly, the Court's power to grant an injunction in the case of a contravention of the Act is contained exclusively in s 80 of the Act and no reliance can be placed on s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): Thomson per Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ at 161-162; Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135 (Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) at 145 [22] (' Foster' ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Thirdly, in the same way as an injunction must be couched in clear and unambiguous language, so must an undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As the learned authors of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, 2002) at [21-505] say, 'the recipient of it must be placed in a position where he knows exactly what he is obliged to do'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 per French J at 88-89 [26] (' REIWA ')).</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">An undertaking should not be accepted if it is vague and uncertain or if enforcement is likely to prove impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This proposition is subject to a narrow qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I agree with the point made by French J, albeit in the context of s 86C, that in the context of compliance programmes it is neither practicable nor useful to prescribe with minute particularity the content of such programmes: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1548 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">An order or undertaking which contains objectives to be fulfilled, or aims to be achieved, might be too uncertain to be enforceable, although the problem might be overcome by making the obligation a best or reasonable endeavours obligation: REIWA per French J at 90 [35].</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Fourthly, there must be a relevant nexus between the injunction or undertaking and the alleged or established contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It is not the case that an injunction or undertaking can only be framed in terms of restraining a repetition of contravening or alleged contravening conduct: Foster .</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">As far as future conduct is concerned, an injunction or undertaking may be in wider terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The question of what is a relevant nexus between the alleged or established conduct and the proposed order or undertaking has been discussed in the context of orders or undertakings requiring a compliance or educational programme to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Of course, there is no denying the desirability of an extensive compliance or educational programme, but that is a different issue from the question of the Court's power to order such a programme or to accept an undertaking to implement such a programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197 (' Z-Tek '), Merkel J considered the scope of an appropriate order implementing a trade practices compliance programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">His Honour said (at 203): 
 
 summary, in determining whether an injunction under s 80 is "appropriate" there are, at least, three limitations on the Court's power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 the power is confined by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA and in particular s 80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It is within the scope and purpose of s 80 to grant injunctive relief which is designed to prevent a repetition of the conduct for which the relief is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 
 there is a contextual limitation within s 80 itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As the jurisdiction to grant an injunction is enlivened by an alleged or actual contravention of a provision of Pt IV , IVA or V of the TPA, there must be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the contravention and the injunction granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It is that nexus or relationship that enables determination by the Court of whether the injunction sought is "appropriate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 there is the constitutional limitation which requires that the injunction granted be related to the case or controversy the subject of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">' 
 

A little later, his Honour said (at 205):
 
 
 trade practices compliance program agreed to relates to the TPA generally rather than to the specific provisions in Pt V which are alleged to have been contravened by Z-Tek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was contended by counsel for the ACCC that the program was "appropriate" because it arose as a result of a breach of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In my view the contention is based on an unwarranted and excessively broad view of s 80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The jurisdiction to make orders under s 80 only arises as a result of advertising and representations by Z-Tek which are alleged to have contravened ss 52 , 53 (e) and 53C of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">As the order is sought under s 80(1AA) I do not have to be satisfied that the conduct contravened the particular provisions of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Nevertheless, I must determine whether the orders are "appropriate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 
 the reasons discussed earlier any order requiring the implementation of a trade practices compliance program should be one which has a sufficient nexus or relationship to the conduct alleged to constitute a breach of a particular provision of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Given that the orders are sought by consent I am prepared to take a broad view of the conduct which may fairly be described as misleading or deceptive advertising and the making of representations in contravention of ss 52 , 53 (e) and 53C of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The compliance program, which the Court may order, should be no wider than one which is designed to prevent repetition of that conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">
 
 orders sought require a compliance program in respect of all parts of the TPA which will include, for example, Pt IV and other parts which have no connection whatsoever with the alleged conduct giving rise to the case or controversy in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">In my view it is not appropriate to make orders which require a compliance program which relates to conduct other than the alleged contravening conduct as characterised by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

The comments of Merkel J (at 203) were referred to in Foster .</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The Full Court did not say anything to suggest that they did not agree with his observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">French J considered the same issue in REIWA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">His Honour said (at 88): 
 
 question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the order sought and the contravention alleged involves an evaluative judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">At one level the orders sought may be so remote from the contravention alleged that the question is readily resolved as one of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Thus an injunction directing implementation of a compliance program covering all of the provisions of Pt V in answer to an alleged contravention of Pt IV of the Act might well be thought so remote from the contravention as to be beyond the purpose of s 80 and thus beyond its power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">A fortiori such an order might be thought inappropriate even if strictly within power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I respectfully agree with his Honour in relation to that aspect of his approach in the Z-Tek case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">
 
 contravention of a basic prohibition of competition law may be indicative of lack of awareness of the requirements of that law generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">To enter into a blatant price fixing arrangement with a competitor might well fall within that category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In such a case an order for a compliance program providing for development of awareness of the provision contravened and related areas of competition law may be seen as appropriately connected to the contravention and designed to prevent the diversion of public resources to further enforcement action whether in relation to the contravention grounding the claim or contraventions in the same general area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">What is "a sufficient nexus" between the conduct the subject of the injunction and the conduct alleged or found to constitute a contravention of a provision of the Act is a matter of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In ACCC v Z-Tek Merkel J accepted that the making of orders or the acceptance of undertakings to implement a trade practices compliance program are within the power conferred upon the court by s 80 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">
 
 that case his Honour considered ordering a compliance program with respect to Pt V generally but declined to do so on the basis of the disparate nature of the provisions of Pt V which were as far removed from the contravention complained of as Pt V is from the provisions of Pt IV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In the event this was a question of judgment of the sufficiency of the nexus between the compliance program ordered and the particular contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">I do not take his Honour's approach to preclude the possibility of a compliance program which covers the provisions of Pt IV generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">' 
 
 I respectfully agree with those observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Before leaving this point, I should mention s 86C of the Act which was introduced in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It relevantly provides: 
 
 The Court may, on application by the Commission, make one or more of the orders mentioned in subsection (2) in relation to a person who has engaged in contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 The orders that the Court may make in relation to the person are: 
 
 a community service order; and 
 
 a probation order for a period of no longer than 3 years; and 
 
 an order requiring the person to disclose, in the way and to the persons specified in the order, such information as is so specified, being information that the person has possession of or access to; and 
 
 an order requiring the person to publish, at the person's expense and in the way specified in the order, an advertisement in the terms specified in, or determined in accordance with, the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 
 This section does not limit the Court's powers under any other provision of this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 In this section: 
 
 service order , ... 
 
 conduct means conduct that: 
 
 contravenes Part IV, IVA, IVB, V or VC or section 75AU or 75AYA; or 
 
 constitutes an involvement in a contravention of any of those provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">
 
 order , in relation to a person who has engaged in contravening conduct, means an order that is made by the Court for the purpose of ensuring that the person does not engage in the contravening conduct, similar conduct or related conduct during the period of the order, and includes: 
 
 an order directing the person to establish a compliance program for employees or other persons involved in the person's business, being a program designed to ensure their awareness of the responsibilities and obligations in relation to the contravening conduct, similar conduct or related conduct; and 
 
 an order directing the person to establish an education and training program for employees or other persons involved in the person's business, being a program designed to ensure their awareness of the responsibilities and obligations in relation to the contravening conduct, similar conduct or related conduct; and 
 
 an order directing the person to revise the internal operations of the person's business which lead to the person engaging in the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">' 
 
 This section is not directly relevant in this case because it is only engaged on a finding that a person has engaged in contravening conduct (s 86C(1)) and that is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I note that the type of 'probation order' which may be made under the section may only relate to the 'contravening conduct, similar conduct or related conduct' so the section itself requires a nexus between the contravening conduct and the order or undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I did not hear submissions on whether s 86C bears upon the interpretation of s 80 and I will say nothing on that topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I will proceed by having regard to the principles developed in the context of s 80 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Fifthly, a question which has arisen in the cases, and which arises in this case, is the Court's power to make an order or accept an undertaking requiring an external audit of a compliance programme or, alternatively, the appropriateness of so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It seems that such an order may not be made under s 86C: BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2004) 207 ALR 452 (Gray, Goldberg and Weinberg JJ) at 468 [51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It is important to have a clear understanding of what is meant by an external audit of a compliance programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In my opinion, an order or undertaking which leaves the definition of the major obligations undertaken by a respondent to a third party or which makes the question of whether there has been a breach turn on the assessment or opinion of a third party is beyond power, or at the very least inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">A court should not grant an injunction leaving the scope of the injunction to be determined by a third party and should not accept an undertaking to similar effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Such an injunction or undertaking would not be in clear and unambiguous terms and it would involve an impermissible delegation of the Court's power to formulate the terms of the order and to determine the question of breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">None of this is to say that an order or undertaking might not include a provision for an external audit providing the major obligations are defined and it is clear that the question of breach is for the court to determine, having regard to the facts and the terms of the order or undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I turn now to consider the particular undertakings proffered in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The first undertaking which is proffered by the corporate respondents is in the following terms: 
 
 of Auspine Limited, Geo J Bone &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and JAG Timber Products Pty Ltd, for a period of 5 years, whether by its directors, servants or agents or otherwise howsoever, undertakes to the Court to refrain from: 
 
 making or attempting to make any contract or arrangement, or arriving at or attempting to arrive at any understanding, with a competitor or competitors containing a provision or provisions that:- 
 
 any or all of them would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost; 
 
 any or all of them would procure or attempt to procure or induce other competitors to make an arrangement or arrangements, alternatively to arrive at an understanding or understandings, containing a provision to the same effect, but including such other competitors or some of them, as the provision set out in subparagraph (i) above; or 
 
 (iii) any or all of them would charge customers for estimating services at a particular price or particular prices or in accordance with or by reference to a particular mechanism, process or procedure by which the price or prices of estimating services to be charged by all or any of them would be fixed or controlled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">
 
 giving effect to any such contract, arrangement or understanding with a competitor or competitors containing a provision or provisions that:- 
 
 any or all of them would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost; 
 
 any or all of them would procure or attempt to procure or induce other competitors to make an arrangement or arrangements, alternatively to arrive at an understanding or understandings, containing a provision to the same effect, but including such other competitors or some of them, as the provision set out in subparagraph (i) above; or 
 
 any or all of them would charge customers for estimating services at a particular price or particular prices or in accordance with or by reference to a particular mechanism, process or procedure by which the price or prices of estimating services to be charged by all or any of them would be fixed or controlled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">' 
 


 This is an undertaking which restrains conduct which would be a contravention of the Act and, as it is within the power of the Court to grant an injunction in similar terms, it is within the power of the Court to accept the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I have the power to accept the first undertaking and I think that it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The undertaking has been proffered as part of a negotiated settlement of what is a complex dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Unless there was good reason not to do so, and there is no such reason here, then, providing the adoption of the settlement is within power, I should give effect to the settlement reached between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">All the corporate respondents were legally represented as was the Commission and I see no reason why it would not be appropriate to accept the first undertaking: N W Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ at 291; REIWA per French J at 87 [20]-[21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The second undertaking is proffered by the three individual respondents and is in the following terms: 
 
 of Mr Frank McDonald, Mr Andrew Bone and Mr Gary Daniel, for a period of 5 years, undertakes to the Court to refrain from inducing or attempting to induce or being directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to the making of, or the arriving at, or the giving effect to, any such contract, arrangement or understanding between a corporation and one or more of its competitors which contains a provision or provisions that: 
 
 any or all of them would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost; 
 
 any or all of them would procure or attempt to procure or induce other competitors to make arrangement or arrangements, alternatively to arrive at an understanding or understandings, containing a provision to the same effect, but including such other competitors or some of them, as the provision set out in sub-paragraph (i) above; or 
 
 any or all of them would charge customers for estimating services at a particular price or particular prices or in accordance with or by reference to a particular mechanism, process or procedure by which the price or prices of estimating services to be charged by all or any of them would be fixed or controlled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">' 
 
 As with the first undertaking, I have the power to accept the undertaking and I think it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The individual respondents, other than Mr McDonald, had legal representation, and Mr McDonald told me that he had received legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The third undertaking is proffered by Auspine, the fourth is proffered by Bone Timber and JAG Timber, and the fifth is proffered by the individual respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">All undertakings require positive measures to be undertaken by those proffering them and the measures involve compliance or education programmes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I will deal first with the fifth undertaking because it is straightforward and can be disposed of briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It is in the following terms: 
 
 undertaking given to the Court by each of Mr Frank McDonald, Mr Andrew Bone and Mr Gary Daniel that he will attend a Trade Practices Compliance seminar in accordance with the terms of Annexure 2 hereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">' 
 
 Annexure 2 provides as follows: 
 
 The Respondent will attend a Trade Practices Compliance Seminar conducted by an independent person with appropriate knowledge of trade practices law within 3 months of this Undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">
 
 The Seminar will address the provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("the TPA") proscribing restrictive trade practices and will, in particular, address the issue of price fixing and anti-competitive collusion in the context of contracts, arrangements and understandings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">' In my opinion, the undertaking is within power and it would be appropriate to accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">It is true that the seminar will go beyond the particular provisions in issue in this case, but I think there is a sufficient nexus between the alleged contravening conduct and the subject matter of the proposed seminar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The seminar is to relate to Part IV of the Act and, in particular, the issue of price fixing and anti-competitive collusion in the context of contracts, arrangements and undertakings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In my opinion, a knowledge of the other provisions of Part IV of the Act will assist in an understanding of the operation of s 45 and s 45A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The third undertaking is proffered by Auspine and is in the following terms: 
 
 undertaking given to the Court by the first respondent that it will implement the recommendations contained in the March 2006 'Report on the Implementation and Effectiveness of Auspine Limited's Trade Practices Compliance Program' prepared by Watchdog Compliance Pty Ltd which forms exhibit DCJ-1 to the affidavit of David Charles Johnson filed on behalf of the First Respondent in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">' 
 
 Mr Johnson is the author of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">He holds qualifications in economics and law and was employed in the Commission's compliance section for a number of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">He appears to be well-qualified to express the opinions set out in the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The purpose of the report was to review the implementation and effectiveness of Auspine's trade practice compliance programme over five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The aim or purpose of the report is stated in paragraph 13 as follows: 
 
 report aims to provide Auspine with a summary of the trade practices compliance measures that Auspine has taken over the preceding five years and our independent assessment of how effective those measures have been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 
 The conclusions of Mr Johnson are generally favourable to Auspine in terms of the effectiveness of its trade practices compliance programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">However, in the course of his report Mr Johnson makes a number of recommendations, and those recommendations are the subject of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">They are as follows: 
 
 Auspine may wish to consider the development of short, targeted information sheets that could be made available to staff as relevant (eg restrictive trade practices issues, consumer protections issues).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">These would be more likely to be read and referred to by staff than the longer manuals and policies that are currently available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 It may also benefit Auspine to engage in a process (eg regular e-mails, notices or short regular training sessions for staff) which are designed to raise staff awareness of their everyday trade practices obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 ... 
 
 That Auspine, in consultation with its current Company Secretary and Legal Counsel review whether any additional support or resources are required to effectively perform the role of Compliance Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">
 
 ... 
 
 Auspine may wish to consider strengthening its program by arranging regular "reminder" sessions for staff and business managers on how trade practices issues can be identified and referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">For example, as resources permit, Auspine's Legal Counsel may be able to provide regular brief presentations at various Business Unit meetings within Auspine on current trade practices related matters that may have an impact on Auspine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">This will also allow that person to "touch base" with staff and keep trade practices compliance current in the minds of staff in between the planned biannual training sessions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 
 ... 
 
 If training is to be rolled out to Auspine staff every two years, steps should be taken during that time to ensure that staff remain aware of current trade practices issues and any changes to the legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Auspine may wish to consider short, regular trade practices "information" sessions that could be conducted for targeted staff on topics of relevance to Auspine's operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">This will assist Auspine by reducing the time between training sessions, ensuring more targeted training is conducted while minimising disruption to everyday duties of staff and general business operations of Auspine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">
 
 ... 
 
 Auspine may wish to strengthen the Program by taking steps to remind staff on a regular basis of the trade practices risks that are relevant to their everyday operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">This could be done by way of targeted brief information sessions for groups of staff or regular presentations by Auspine's Legal Counsel at Business Unit or staff meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">' 
 
 
 

 It seems to me that there are two difficulties with this undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The first difficulty is that the compliance programme to which the undertaking relates goes beyond the provisions of ss 45 and 45A of the Act and indeed the provisions in Part IV of the Act ( Z-Tek , REIWA ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This difficulty can be overcome by linking the recommendations to the provisions in Part IV of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The second difficulty relates to the nature of the recommendations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Is it within power or appropriate to impose nothing more than an obligation to consider doing something?</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Counsel for the Commission said that it was, likening the obligation to that placed on the holder of a power to appoint property of a testator or settlor to third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I am prepared to accept that in the circumstances of this case it is within power and appropriate to impose an obligation (or accept an undertaking) requiring Auspine to consider doing something.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The undertaking is proffered as part of a commercial settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Auspine is a large organisation which has a detailed trade practices compliance programme and an obvious interest in improving the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The difficulty with some of the recommendations set out above is that they do not even place an obligation on Auspine to consider taking a particular course of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">I would not accept an undertaking in such terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">This particular problem can be overcome by making the obligation to consider mandatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The fourth undertaking is proffered by Bone Timber and JAG Timber and is in the following terms: 
 
 undertaking given to the Court by each of the Third and Fifth Respondents that it will implement a Trade Practices Corporate Compliance Program in accordance with the terms of Annexure 1 hereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 
 There are difficulties with this undertaking which arise from the terms of the programme referred to in the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">To understand these difficulties, it is necessary to set out in full the terms of the programme: 
 
 The Respondent shall appoint a Trade Practices Compliance Officer to be responsible for the implementation of the Program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The Program will be implemented within two calendar months of this Undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">
 
 The Respondent shall ensure that The Trade Practices Compliance Officer receives training in trade practices law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">
 
 
 
 The Respondent will ensure that the Program, including processes which the Respondent intends to implement in order to comply with the Program, are approved by an independent external consultant with appropriate knowledge of trade practices law prior to implementation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">
 
 
 
 The Respondent shall require the Trade Practices Compliance Officer to review: 
 
 
 
 The contents of any media and material containing training or operational information for its staff to ensure that it adequately addresses and informs about: 
 
 restrictive trade practices proscribed by Part IV of the Trade Practices 1974 [sic] ('the TPA'), including in particular price fixing and anti-competitive collusion in the context of contracts, arrangements and understandings; and 
 
 4.1.2 consequences of breaching the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">
 
 Training and operating procedures for its staff involved in any way in quoting or providing takeoffs for supply of timber, or in organizing, attending or otherwise participating in any meetings with competitors concerning matters relevant to the trading activities of such persons, to ensure that its staff are adequately informed and advised about: 
 
 restrictive trade practices proscribed by the TPA, including in particular price fixing and anti-competitive collusion in the context of contracts, arrangements and understandings; 
 
 not contravening the provisions of Part IV of the TPA; and 
 
 4.2.3 consequences of breaching the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 
 The Respondent shall require the Trade Practices Compliance Officer to maintain a documentary record of the compliance review of: 
 
 
 
 The Respondent's training and operational media and material; 
 
 The Respondent's training and operating procedures for staff involved in any way quoting or providing takeoffs for supply of timber, or in organizing, attending or otherwise participating in any meetings with competitors concerning matters relevant to the trading activities of such persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 
 Such documentary record will include: 
 
 (i) a description of the media and materials; 
 
 (ii) a copy of the materials; 
 
 written advice that the relevant media and materials have been reviewed and cleared by the Trade Practices Compliance Officer (including the date on which they were reviewed); 
 
 written advice of any improvements that could be made to reduce the risks of possible contraventions of the TPA that were identified by the Trade Practices Compliance Officer and the action taken to implement those improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">
 
 The Respondent shall ensure that the documentary records of the compliance reviews are available to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be reviewed from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Such records are to be available from one week after the date of review for a period of three years after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Such records are to be provided to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission within five working days of a written request for those records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The Respondent shall ensure that an independent external consultant with expertise in trade practices law conducts training on the Program including in relation to price fixing and anti-competitive collusion in contravention of Section 45 of the TPA, to the Respondent's staff on six occasions during the three year period following the making of this Undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The first of these training programs is to be completed within three calendar months of this Undertaking and the remaining five on a six monthly basis thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Respondent shall retain an independent external consultant with expertise in trade practices law to provide the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with three annual reports (being at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months following the making of this Undertaking) on the Respondent's compliance with the Program, and these reports shall be provided to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission within: 
 
 13 months of this Undertaking; 
 
 25 months of this Undertaking; and 
 
 37 months of this Undertaking respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 The annual reports shall include the review and reporting of: 
 
 The Respondent's adherence to the Program; 
 
 The implementation of the Program, its consistency with Australian Standard AS-3806 and the achievement of its objectives over the preceding twelve months; and 
 
 Any recommended changes to the Program that may be necessary to ensure achievement of its objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">' 
 
 The principal problem is that the major aspects of the programme are not defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The formulation of the programme is left to the respondent and the external consultant (clause 3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The suggestion is that it is up to an independent external consultant to determine if whatever programme is formulated is appropriate and is implemented from time to time (clauses 8 and 9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">As I have said, I do not see a difficulty with a requirement that an independent external consultant review the question of compliance with a programme providing the major aspects of the programme are defined and providing the question of whether there has been a breach of the programme is not made to turn solely on the consultant's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A further difficulty is that there is a suggestion (see clause 9(c)) that the programme may be changed from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">I do not think that I have the power to accept this undertaking or, in the alternative, I do not think that it is appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Conclusion For these reasons, I refuse to accept the undertakings proffered by the respondents and to make the orders sought by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">I will give the parties liberty to apply so that the parties can make a further application if so advised.</sentence>
