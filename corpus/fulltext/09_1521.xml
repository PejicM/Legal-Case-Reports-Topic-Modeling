<sentence id="s0">
 This is an amended application dated 29 October 2009 ('amended application') by the applicant ('Mrs Coshott') to set aside Bankruptcy Notice No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">NN4442 of 2009 ('the Bankruptcy Notice') served on Mrs Coshott on 10 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">By the amended application, Mrs Coshott also sought, pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act'), that time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended 'pending the outcome of [her] Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceeding 4000/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">BACKGROUND 
 The Bankruptcy Notice claimed Mrs Coshott owed a debt to the respondent ('Mr Barry') of $304,787.01, comprising a judgment of the District Court of New South Wales ('the District Court') for $303,599.25 entered in favour of Mr Barry on 7 September 2009 (Plaint No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4000/09) together with interest accrued since the date of judgment in the sum of $1,187.76.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The judgment arises from the registration of a determination of costs assessed against Mrs Coshott under s 368 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) ('the Legal Profession Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The costs assessment (2008/00017354) arises from a costs order made in favour of Mr Barry against Mrs Coshott and her husband in proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales: Coshott v Barry [2007] NSWSC 1094.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">An appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was unsuccessful: Coshott v Barry [2009] NSWCA 34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 1 July 2009, Mrs Coshott filed in the District Court an amended summons to appeal the costs assessment 2008/00017354.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appeal (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">2872/09) is brought pursuant to ss 384 and 385 of the Legal Profession Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appeal under s 384 is brought as of right; the appeal under s 385 is subject to leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 23 October 2009, Mrs Coshott filed a notice of motion in the District Court to set aside the judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4000/09, a stay of the judgment, a stay of the enforcement of the judgment and a suspension, pursuant to s 386 of the Legal Profession Act , of the cost assessor's determination (2008/00017354) pending the outcome of proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">2872/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 29 October 2009, a Registrar of this Court extended time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice to 11 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">That decision is the subject of an interim application for review by Mr Barry, which I heard at the same time as Mrs Coshott's amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice was further extended by another Registrar of the Court on 11 November 2009, extending time for compliance until 18 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 17 November, I fixed Mrs Coshott's amended application and Mr Barry's interim application for hearing on 4 December 2009 and extended the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice until 7 December 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On 27 November 2009, the notice of motion in District Court proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">4000/09 was heard and dismissed in its entirety on the basis that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant the stay and other relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">On 1 December 2009, Mrs Coshott filed a notice of motion seeking to amend the summons in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">2872/09 so as to add a claim that judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">4000/09 be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Those proceedings were also listed for directions on that date, and directions were made in relation to the notice of motion, including that it be listed for hearing on 18 December 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">MR BARRY'S INTERIM APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF THE DECISION OF THE REGISTRAR MADE ON 29 OCTOBER 2009 
 At the time she filed her amended application on 29 October 2009, Mrs Coshott filed a supporting affidavit sworn 27 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There was exhibited to that affidavit and marked 'Exhibit LC-1' various documents including a copy of the Bankruptcy Notice, a copy of the sealed judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">4000/09, a copy of the certificate of determination of costs (assessment No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">00017354 of 2008), copies of various correspondence and other process in proceedings Nos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">2872/09 and 4000/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It is not clear whether 'Exhibit LC-1' was filed with the affidavit, but if it was, it became detached and was not before the Registrar when, on that same day, she extended time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice until 11 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The fact that 'Exhibit LC-1' was not before the Registrar at the time she extended time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice forms the basis of Mr Barry's interim application for review of the Registrar's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 41(6A) of the Act provides: 
 
 (6A) Where, before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice: 
 

 
 
 
 (a) proceedings to set aside a judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued have been instituted by the debtor; or 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) an application has been made to the Court to set aside the bankruptcy notice; 
 
 

 
 
 the Court may, subject to subsection (6C), extend the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 

 Counsel for Mrs Coshott made the following submissions in support of his contention that the Registrar properly exercised her discretion to extend time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, and none of the factual material underlying these submissions was put in issue by counsel for Mr Barry; on the contrary, they were common ground: 
(1) When the Registrar made the order, the time fixed for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice had not expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The notice had been served on Mrs Coshott on 10 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">(2) The amended application in these proceedings was filed on 29 October 2009 prior to the expiry of the Bankruptcy Notice, and (it should be inferred) was also filed before the making of the order extending time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The relief sought in that application includes the setting aside of the Bankruptcy Notice and an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in accordance with s 41(6A) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">(3) Also prior to the Registrar making the order extending time, and prior to the expiration of the Bankruptcy Notice, there had been filed in the District Court:
 
(a) An amended summons to appeal the costs assessment, in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">2872/09, filed on 1 July 2009; and
 
(b) a notice of motion to set aside District Court judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">4000/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">(4) The Court therefore had jurisdiction under s 41(6A) to extend time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There is no suggestion that the Court, or the Registrar, was of the opinion referred to in s 41(6C).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">(5) The Registrar had power to extend time under s 41(6A): Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 35A(1)(h) ; Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2005 (Cth), r 2.02, Sch 2, Item 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">(6) The discretion to extend time was granted up to and including Wednesday, 11 November 2009, whilst at the same time the parties were given liberty to apply to vary or discharge the order extending time on 24 hours' notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">(7) This extension of time was a minimal extension of time, to the date of the first directions hearing, at which time it was then necessary for Mrs Coshott to renew her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(8) If the application had not been granted, an act of bankruptcy would have occurred prior to the directions hearing, rendering the application futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The alternative would be for the Court to list any such application for an inter partes hearing within the time limited under the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">This would no doubt cause considerable inconvenience for the Court if this course were to be generally adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">(9) It was appropriate for the extension of time to be granted on that occasion, just as it was granted on two subsequent occasions, pending a final hearing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I agree with these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I am firmly of the view that in exercising her discretion to extend the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice until 11 November 2009, the Registrar's discretion did not miscarry and that her decision is not otherwise infected with any error which would warrant it being set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I therefore decline to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">MRS COSHOTT'S AMENDED APPLICATION TO SET ASIDE THE BANKRUPTCY NOTICE AND FOR TIME FOR THE COMPLIANCE TO BE EXTENDED 
 The substantive final orders sought by Mrs Coshott in her amended application of 29 October 2009 were cast as follows: 
 
 On the grounds stated in the supporting affidavits, the Applicant seeks the following orders: 
 

 Pursuant to s.30 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , that Bankruptcy Notice No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">NN4442 of 2009 (" Bankruptcy Notice "), which was served on the Applicant on 10 October 2009, be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">A copy of that Bankruptcy Notice accompanies this Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Pursuant to s.41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , that the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended pending the outcome of the Applicant's Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceedings 4000/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In other words, the first application was to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">There is no express power in the Act to do so but it is common ground that it is within the general powers of the Court conferred by s 30(1) of the Act: see Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Forge [2003] FCAFC 274 ; (2003) 133 FCR 487 at [26] per Emmett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The second application sought an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in reliance on s 41(6A) of the Act pending the outcome of Mrs Coshott's notice of motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">4000/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">As Hill and Marshall JJ observed in Shepherd v Chiquita Brands South Pacific Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 76 at [40] : 
 
 Clearly s 41(6A) was intended to be in aid of the application to set aside ... the bankruptcy notice ... 
 

 
See too Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 44 FLR 125 at 130.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The written and oral submissions on behalf of Mrs Coshott were structured and articulated on the basis that the primary application was for an extension of time for compliance when, in truth, that was not the primary application; the primary application was to have the Bankruptcy Notice set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">If that application is dismissed, then one of the two bases upon which the Court may extend time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, that in para (b) of s 41(6A) , goes away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In any event, that is how I propose to consider and deal with Mrs Coshott's amended application of 29 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">First, consider and rule on her application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice and then consider and rule on her application for the Court to further extend time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">There are, in my view, a number of problems with Mrs Coshott's application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice, not the least of which are: 
(1) Her amended application of 29 October 2009 was not accompanied by an affidavit which complied with r 3.02(1) of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2006 in that the affidavit did not set out the grounds in support of the application to set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Arguably, Mrs Coshott's affidavit of 27 October 2009 filed in support of her amended application of 29 October 2009 set out the grounds upon which she sought an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in compliance with r 3.03(1), but even that is not beyond argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">But even if she did, that would not satisfy the requirements of r 3.02(1) which requires the affidavit to set out the grounds in support of the application to set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">As was noted in Maher v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FMCA 1004 , a failure to address the material requirements of r 3.02 (in that case it was r 3.02 of the Federal Magistrates Court (Bankruptcy) Rules, but they are in the same terms) will normally be fatal to an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">(2) Second, counsel for Mrs Coshott did not articulate any grounds upon which the application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice was founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The best one can find is at para (70) of his written submissions where it is put:
 
 
 
 The application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice is underlying [the] application to set aside the Certificate of Determination [of Costs] [in] the District Court ... 
 
 

 
With respect, that is not a proper ground in support of Mrs Coshott's application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">As was said by Emmett J in Forge at [27]:
 
 
 [T]he Act gives no general discretion to set aside bankruptcy notices that are valid in form and not an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Act permits the issue of a bankruptcy notice and, if the notice is valid, prescribes the consequences to the bankrupt of non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The grounds upon which a bankruptcy notice may be set aside must relate to the form or content of the notice, service of the notice or the existence of the debt upon which the judgment, and, in turn, the notice, is founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Reference to the existence of a debt includes the existence of a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the debt: Re Briggs; Ex parte Briggs v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (WA) (1986) 12 FCR 310 ; Re Athans; Ex parte Athans (1991) 29 FCR 302.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Since jurisdiction to set aside a defective bankruptcy notice is not a general discretionary jurisdiction, it differs from the jurisdiction to make a sequestration order under s 52(1), which is expressly discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 In the circumstances, I have no alternative but to dismiss Mrs Coshott's amended application insofar as it seeks an order that the Bankruptcy Notice be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Turning to her application pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Act that the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended, I do so on the basis that, in the face of the conclusion expressed in [19] above, the requirement that is para (b) of s 41(6A) is no longer satisfied; there is no application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Consequently, the application for an extension of time for compliance can only be entertained if the requirement that is para (a) of s 41(6A) is satisfied, namely, that Mrs Coshott has instituted proceedings to set aside the judgment in respect of which the Bankruptcy Notice was issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">But there is a threshold difficulty with the application to extend time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice because of the temporal limitation in para (2) of Mrs Coshott's amended application: 
 
 ... pending the outcome of the Applicant's Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceeding 4000/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 

 
As indicated at [7] above, on 27 November 2009 that motion was heard and dismissed in its entirety on the basis that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to grant the stay in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">4000/09 and the other relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The dismissal of Mrs Coshott's motion in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">4000/09 did not operate as a discharge of her application for an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice because, on 17 November 2009, I had extended the time for compliance until 7 December 2009 and, on the completion of the hearing of these applications, I ordered that the time for compliance be further extended until the day I pronounce the orders of the Court and publish my reasons for judgment on the amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Consequently, counsel for Mrs Coshott sought the leave of the Court, over the opposition of counsel for Mr Barry, to further amend the amended application for an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice in para 2 of the amended application as follows: 
 
 (2) Pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , that the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended pending the outcome of proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">2872/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney and the final determination of this proceeding .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 

 I was initially reluctant to grant leave at such a late stage, however, upon reflection, I think leave should be granted primarily because proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">2872/09 was instituted well before the issue and service of the Bankruptcy Notice and not in response to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It was the filing of the notice of motion in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">4000/09 which was in response to the issue and service of the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">So amended, the next question which arises is whether proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">2872/09 satisfies the requirement of para (a) of s 41(6A) as being a proceeding to 'set aside a judgment or order in respect of which the [B]ankruptcy [N]otice was issued'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">2872/09 was an appeal '... from the decision below (costs assessment 2008/00017354)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The orders sought included an order that: Certificate of Determination in 2008/00017354 be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Counsel for Mrs Coshott submitted that the fact that it was not sought to set aside the judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">4000/09, but rather the underlying certificate of determination which had merged into the judgment is of no import because the judgment is liable to be set aside or varied if the certificate on which it is based is set aside or varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Reliance was placed on what was said by Hodgson JA (with whom Mason P and Campbell JA agreed) in Doyle v Hall Chadwick [2007] NSWCA 159 at [48] to [53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">What was said there was said in relation to s 208J(3) of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW), the equivalent provision in the Legal Profession Act being s 368(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I agree with this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">So understood, the fact that Mrs Coshott has filed a notice of motion seeking to amend the summons in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">2872/09 so as to add a claim that judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">4000/09 be set aside (see [8] above), is arguably irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Counsel for Mrs Coshott further relied on what a Full Court of this Court said in Conway v Jackson [2001] FCA 230 ; (2001) 107 FCR 201 at [29] : 
 
 We do not agree that the language of s 41(6A)(a) is apt only to encompass an application to set aside a judgment or order where there has been a failure to follow the rules of procedure or where there is shown to be some defect or irregularity or some other circumstance which renders it desirable that the debtor should be given an opportunity to have the issue further litigated, and so as to exclude proceedings by way of appeal which may result in the judgment being set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It does not seem to accord with any legitimate policy consideration that a debtor whose careless or delictual conduct has allowed judgment to pass by default should be in any better position than a judgment debtor who has unsuccessfully but conscientiously defended a claim and succeeds in having the judgment set aside on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 

 
Earlier, at [20], the Court had said:
 
 
 [W]e are of the view that the expression "proceedings to set aside the judgment or order" includes the institution of an appeal from the judgment or order in respect of which the bankruptcy notice was issued where that appeal does in reality seek to have that judgment or order set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
 

 I am satisfied that I have jurisdiction to entertain Mrs Coshott's application for an extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice based on the existence of proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">2872/09 in the District Court and the terms of para (a) of s 41(6A) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The only remaining issue is how I should exercise my discretion: to further extend the time beyond the extensions already made, or to decline to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264 , Lehane J undertook a comprehensive review of the considerations that had been taken into account in other cases involving the exercise of the discretion under s 41(6A) , although, and it almost goes without saying, the considerations to which his Honour referred were conditioned by the facts of the case in respect of which the exercise of his discretion was called for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">His Honour made the following observations: 
(1) It is not only on the hearing of a petition that the Court may 'go behind' the judgment giving rise to the judgment debt on which the petitioning creditor relies; the judgment debt can be impeached on a notice to set aside a bankruptcy notice (at 268D).</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(2) His Honour noted the different approaches of Kiefel J in Re Baker; Ex parte Baker v Staples (unreported, Federal Court, Kiefel J, 4 September 1995) and Sheppard J in Re Geard; Ex parte Reid (unreported, Federal Court, Sheppard J, 11 February 1994) and to later decisions in which Geard was followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">(3) In the course of his judgment in Geard , Sheppard J had taken on board the following considerations:
 
(a) The debtor had not made any application for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal;
 
(b) an application to extend time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is not the hearing of a bankruptcy petition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The refusal of the application will not affect the status of the debtor but it will mean that he, in all probability, will commit an act of bankruptcy;
 
(c) if the appeal is ultimately dismissed and the judgment stands with the consequence that the bankruptcy proceedings go on, it may be quite important to the petitioning creditor, whoever he or she may be, to the general body of creditors and to the trustee in bankruptcy, that there be, for the purposes of the administration of the bankrupt estate, an act of bankruptcy committed at an earlier time than would be the case if the application were acceded to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">(4) The approach adopted by Sheppard J was followed by Whitlam J in Re Smith (unreported, Federal Court, 4 May 1994) and by Sackville J in Agrillo v Codisposto (unreported, Federal Court, Sackville J, 16 December 1994).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">At 270, Lehane J went on to reason: 
 
 In my view the considerations to which Sheppard J refers indicate that the principles to be applied where the question is whether a petition should be adjourned or dismissed are not necessarily those which should guide the exercise of the discretion to set aside, or extend time for compliance with, a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The commission of an act of bankruptcy is, undoubtedly, a serious matter; it is, however, of a different order of gravity from the change of status brought about by the making of a sequestration order; and there is also to be taken into account the interest of both the judgment creditor and other creditors of the judgment debtor in ensuring that, if ultimately a sequestration order is made, the relevant act of bankruptcy occurs earlier rather than later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

 His Honour went on to observe that considerable weight should be given to the circumstance that in the case before him, as in Geard , no stay has been granted (or, apparently, sought) of the judgment supporting the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It did not follow that other matters were not to be taken into account: the discretion is 'at large' ( Re Taylor; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1983] FCA 316 ; (1983) 74 FLR 377 at 379).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">His Honour further observed the authorities suggest that, reluctant as the Court may in most cases be to enter into the merits of an appeal, the merits may be relevant, at least where the Court is able to regard the prospects of success as 'slight' or, possibly, in a case where it is apparent that the prospects of success are unusually strong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Finally, on the facts of the case before him, his Honour thought it relevant, as a consideration reinforcing the Court's reluctance to extend time in the absence of a stay, that an appeal had already been dismissed and the proceeding in question was an application for special leave to make a further appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In Conway v Jackson at [30], the Full Court said: 
 
 In exercising the discretion whether or not to extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice, the creditor should not be routinely frustrated from enforcing the judgment by the device of the institution of an appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Section 41(6C) , to an extent, recognises that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Moreover, the date of the commission of the act of bankruptcy is significant to determine the commencement of the bankruptcy if a sequestration order is made: s 115(1) , and so to determining the property of the bankrupt which is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt: s 116(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It also has significance to the application of ss 118 , 120 , 121 and 122 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The delay in the commission of the act of bankruptcy, if ultimately the requirements of a bankruptcy notice are not complied with and a sequestration order is made, by an extension of time to comply with a bankruptcy notice may therefore have significant consequences to the creditors of the bankrupt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">An extension of time to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice does not, on the other hand, preclude any other judgment creditor from procuring the issue and service of a bankruptcy notice, or from presenting a petition for a sequestration order if some other act of bankruptcy has already been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Such considerations, if significant in the particular circumstances, together with other considerations relevant to the circumstances of the particular case, will no doubt be considered by the Court in exercising its discretion under s 41(6A) of the Act: see for example the discussion by Lehane J in Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">However, such considerations are properly left to the Court in exercising its discretion whether to extend time for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">
 

 Counsel for Mrs Coshott submitted that a further extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice should be allowed in terms of the amended order sought in the amended application by reference to the following considerations: 
(1) The discretion to grant an extension of time for compliance is 'at large': Re Taylor at 379; Byron at 270.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">(2) While there is no stay in place, the application for a stay of proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">4000/09 having been dismissed on 27 November 2009, it was dismissed on jurisdictional, rather than discretionary, grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Considerable weight should only be given to the absence of a stay of the underlying judgment ( Byron at 270G; Geard (in the passage quoted in Byron at 269G)), if the court that granted the judgment had jurisdiction and power to grant a stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In circumstances such as the present, where the court that issued the judgment has determined that it has no jurisdiction to grant a stay, the absence of a stay should, in relation to the discretion under s 41(6A) , be viewed as carrying no weight, rather than 'considerable weight'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">(3) Only a short amount of time is likely to be involved in any extension of time, as the proceeding in the District Court is of limited scope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">(4) If Mrs Coshott succeeds in the District Court to any extent, she will be entitled to an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice: Halstead v Westpac Banking Corporation [1991] FCA 424 ; (1991) 31 FCR 337 at 355.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">(5) Reference was made to the merits of the appeal while acknowledging the reluctance of courts to enter upon that area, save in the particular circumstances referred to by Lehane J in Byron at [36] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The thrust of the submission was that the appeal had merit because:
 
(a) There was no basis for the costs assessor to proceed to determine an amount payable by Mrs Coshott but refuse to determine an amount payable by Mr Coshott;
 
(b) the Legal Profession Act does not give a costs assessor any power to, in effect, alter the terms of an assessment that are referred to him or her;
 
(c) the costs assessor acted ultra vires ;
 
(d) the broad brush approach taken by the costs assessor to assessment was not permissible: Cassegrain v CRK Engineering [2008] NSWSC 457 including the passages extracted therein from Kennedy Miller Television Pty Ltd v Lancken (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, August 1999, Sperling J);
 
(e) inadequate reasons are an error of law: Cassegrain at [86].</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">(6) The Bankruptcy Notice was served after the District Court proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">2872/09 to appeal the Certificate of Determination had been commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Whilst Mr Barry was entitled to do this (there being no stay in place), it is relevant to the discretion that Mr Barry chose to issue his Bankruptcy Notice in circumstances where he knew that the Certificate of Determination, and hence the judgment, was under challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This is not a situation of the appeal being launched in response to a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Indeed, it is arguably the reverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Counsel for Mr Barry submitted that no further extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice should be allowed by reference to the following considerations: 
(1) There was no stay of the judgment upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is based and no suspension of the cost assessor's determination or decision: see s 386 of the Legal Profession Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">(2) There were a number of difficulties with the issues which Mrs Coshott identified as being raised by her appeal in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">2872/09 which cast serious doubt on the likelihood of its success, if not its bona fides , not the least of which was that the orders made by James J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 20 February 2008 that Mr and Mrs Coshott pay the costs of Mr Barry in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">20114/04 gave rise to a joint and several liability: Re Bowen; Ex parte The Australian Workers Union &amp; Ors (1945) 13 ABC 275 at 278 --- 279.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">(3) The consideration in (2) aside, it is inappropriate for me to embark on a course of determining what is or is not going to happen with the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">REASONING AND CONCLUSION ON EXERCISE OF DISCRETION 
 It is true that there is no stay of the judgment upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is based and no suspension of the costs assessor's determination or decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">But both were sought and refused on jurisdictional grounds: see [4] and [7] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The contrast with Geard and Byron is clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">On 1 December 2009, Mr and Mrs Coshott filed a notice of motion in the District Court in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">2872/09 seeking leave to file and serve an amended summons, as well as an order that the enforcement of the judgment in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">4000/09 be stayed pending determination in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">2872/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">That motion is listed for hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I agree with the submission of counsel for Mr Barry that it is not appropriate for me, in the exercise of my discretion under s 41(6A) , to get involved in the merits or otherwise of Mrs Coshott's appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The consideration which I find most telling in favour of exercising my discretion to further extend the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice is that the appeal against the cost assessor's determination was instituted on 1 July 2009, over three months before service of the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">That fact alone informs one that the proceeding is not brought to frustrate the proceeding commenced under the Act by the service of the Bankruptcy Notice and there is no evidence to suggest, nor was it suggested, that there are circumstances now extant which would otherwise attract the operation of s 41(6C).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">For these reasons, I propose to exercise my discretion pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Act by extending the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice until the day on which the District Court of New South Wales makes final orders in proceeding No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">2872/09.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds.</sentence>
