 1 These proceedings concern a claim of sexual harassment made by the appellant against the respondent, his former employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 20 December 2004 the appellant made a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ('HREOC') in respect of the conduct of several of his former work colleagues, which he alleged amounted to sexual harassment within the meaning of s 28A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ('SDA').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant simultaneously made a complaint against the respondent on the basis of s 106 of the SDA, pursuant to which an employer is vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The complaint against the respondent was terminated by the President of HREOC on 1 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Section 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('HREOC Act') provides that following the termination of a complaint, a complainant may within 28 days ('the prescribed period'), or within such other time as the Court allows, apply to have their complaint of unlawful discrimination heard by the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The appellant commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court in relation to his complaint on 26 August 2005, 58 days after the prescribed period had elapsed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Accordingly the appellant required leave of the Federal Magistrates Court to bring the proceedings in that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Driver FM heard the appellant's leave application on 19 September 2005 and delivered an ex tempore judgment in which his Honour determined not to grant leave to the appellant to bring the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The appellant appealed the judgment of Driver FM to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Because Driver FM's decision was interlocutory, the appellant required leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 3 November 2005, Jacobson J granted leave to appeal confined to two questions, namely:
 
 
 1) whether the learned Federal Magistrate erred in his consideration of the test of whether the respondent was prejudiced by delay; and 
 2) whether the learned Federal Magistrate erred in his consideration of whether the respondent was liable for the actions of its employees, having regard to s 106 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 FACTS 
 
5 The appellant commenced employment with the respondent in July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The alleged sexual harassment commenced in December 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In approximately September 2003 the appellant ceased attending the workplace due to an employment-related injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He alleges that a further incident of harassment occurred on 30 August 2004 when he returned to the workplace to provide documentation to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In approximately September 2005 the appellant's contract of employment with the respondent was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 On 20 December 2004 the appellant lodged his complaint with HREOC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">HREOC notified the respondent of the appellant's complaint on 3 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 Section 46PH(1) of the HREOC Act relevantly provides: 
 
 
 '(1) The President may terminate a complaint on any of the following grounds: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the complaint was lodged more than 12 months after the alleged unlawful discrimination took place; 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the President is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being settled by conciliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 


 
8 The President of HREOC terminated the complaint against the respondent by notice of termination dated 1 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In his reasons for termination, the President referred to the fact that the respondent was unwilling to attend a conciliation conference to attempt to resolve the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 For various reasons the appellant did not apply for legal aid until 27 June 2005, two days before the prescribed period was due to expire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Legal Aid was unable to lodge his application with the Federal Magistrates Court until 26 August 2005 due to the time required to process his application and the absence on leave of the solicitor handling the matter,.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">THE DECISION OF DRIVER FM 
 
10 In refusing the leave application Driver FM considered the principles in Phillips v Aust Girls' Choir &amp; Anor [2001] FMCA 109 (' Phillips '), which were approved by this Court in Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is no dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of those principles; rather the dispute relates to the application by Driver FM of those principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The paragraphs of his Honour's reasons which relate to the issues in the current appeal are as follows:
 
 'The issues arising in the matter date from around 1998, although they extended through to 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Gurran, for the respondent, put to me that the allegations made to HREOC came as a surprise to the respondent and the respondent rather thought that the issues might have been resolved at the termination of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">A fourth relevant consideration is any prejudice in defending the proceedings occasioned by the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 This is a material factor against the grant of an extension, see Doyle at page 287.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I regard the issue of prejudice in this case as a significant factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The complaint to HREOC was against the employer only even though it was a complaint of sexual harassment by reason of the applicant's sexual preference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">No complaint having been made against the alleged harassers, no proceeding can now be brought in this court against those persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The jurisdiction of the court is limited to considering the claim against the harasser's employer and would be based on asserted vicarious liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">For its part, the respondent asserted before HREOC that the allegations of harassment came as a surprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 ... 
 The events complained of go back up to seven years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The respondent asserts that the individuals allegedly responsible for the harassment are no longer employed by the respondent and one relevant witness is no longer in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">There would be real difficulty facing the respondent in dealing with the allegations in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The sixth consideration is that the merits of the substantive application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 The material put before HREOC and before the court to this point is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment against the persons allegedly responsible for that harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">That is not the same thing as establishing a prima facie case against the single respondent, the employer, which would depend upon proof of vicarious liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">At this stage and particularly if the only evidence available is that of the applicant I would have to say that the prospects of success of the application against the respondent are uncertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 ... 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">He [the applicant] could have brought that complaint forward rather earlier than he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He certainly could and in my view should have pursued his rights in this court more promptly than he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 Having regard to the length of the delay in this matter which in my view is significant, the explanation for the delay which in my view is only partially convincing, the prejudice to the respondent if the proceeding continues, which in my view is real and substantial, and the interests of the administration of justice, I have come to the view that the application for an extension of time should be refused and I will so order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">' 
 
 PRINCIPLES RELATING TO AN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE 
 
11 Several principles must be considered by the Court in determining an application for leave to extend time in which to institute proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In Phillips McInnis FM referred to Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 in which Wilcox J (at 348-9) set out the principles to be adopted in relation to an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">McInnis FM determined that those principles were applicable to the exercise of discretion under s 46PO of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Accordingly his Honour (at [10]) set out the following principles:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The "prescribed period" of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It is not a pre-condition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential pre-condition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(See Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287) 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">(See Doyle at p 287) 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">(See Lucic at p 416) 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">(See Lucic at p 417) 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of the court's discretion ( Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 

12 The above principles are drawn almost verbatim from those formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I consider that they are relevant to an application under s 46PO of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The principles relevant to this appeal are numbers 4 and 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">13 The appellant contends that Driver FM erred in his interpretation of prejudice for the purposes of an application to extend time in which to bring proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The appellant also contends that Driver FM erred in assessing the merits of the appellant's case, because his Honour misconceived the basis of the vicarious liability of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">14 Since the decision by Driver FM was an exercise of his Honour's discretion, the principles referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 in relation to the role of the appeal court apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In that decision, the majority of the High Court said at 504-5:
 
 'It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">' 

See also Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation and Anor v The Commonwealth and Ors [1953] HCA 25 ; (1953) 94 CLR 621 at 627 per Kitto J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES 
 PREJUDICE 
 
15 In assessing prejudice to the respondent arising from the delay in instituting this appeal, the appellant submits that the Court is only entitled to take into account prejudice caused by the delay of 58 days following the expiration of the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The appellant says that Driver FM erred in taking into account the prejudice to the respondent resulting from the long period of time which has elapsed since the alleged conduct commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The appellant submits that such prejudice is not relevant in the context of an application for an extension of time, because it does not result from the delay of 58 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">16 In Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479 Bray CJ said (at 485):
 
 'If the defendant has suffered no prejudice, as when he was well aware within the limitation period of the plaintiff's claim, or where the excess period of time is small, or where he cannot show that he has lost anything by reason of the delay, it may well be that the court will not find it difficult to come to the conclusion that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to grant the extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 

All of the examples referred to by Bray CJ are examples of prejudice caused specifically by the delay in instituting proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">17 There are numerous authorities of this Court in which prejudice has been considered in this context, each of which has related to prejudice which accrued during the period for which an extension is sought: see for example Wedesweiller and Ors v Cole and Ors (1983) 47 ALR 528; Hickey and Ors v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1983) 47 ALR 517; Duff and Ors v Freijah and Ors (1982) 62 FLR 280.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I have not been referred to any authority in which a court has taken into account prejudice caused by delay occurring prior to the commencement of the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">18 Significantly, the HREOC Act places no time limit on the making of a complaint of unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Accordingly while the appellant in this case did not make a complaint to HREOC until more than five years after the conduct allegedly commenced, the appellant was entitled to make his complaint to HREOC when he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Whilst the absence of a time limit in the HREOC Act may cause difficulties to respondents in some circumstances, the legislative scheme permits complaints to be made to HREOC at any time, and to be subsequently brought to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">19 Driver FM did not identify any prejudice to the respondent resulting from the failure to lodge the appeal within the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Rather the prejudice referred to by Driver FM was occasioned by the fact that the appellant did not make a complaint to HREOC until 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">I agree with the submission of the appellant that Driver FM erred by taking into account the prejudice suffered by the respondent which predated the expiry of the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The only relevant period for consideration of prejudice is the 58 days following the expiry of the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">VICARIOUS LIABILITY 
 
20 The second ground of appeal raises the issue of whether the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court made out a prima facie case against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The appellant submitted that Driver FM misconstrued the requirements for vicarious liability under the SDA, and accordingly misconceived the merits of the appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">21 The complaint made by the appellant to HREOC concerned alleged conduct by employees of the respondent which constituted sexual harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Sexual harassment is defined in s 28A of the SDA, which relevantly states:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Division, a person sexually harasses another person (the "person harassed") if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed; or 
 (b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed; 
 
 
 
 
 in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">' 
 

22 Section 28B(2) makes it unlawful for an employee to sexually harass a fellow employee or a person who is seeking employment with the same employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">23 Pursuant to s 106 of the SDA, an employer may be liable for conduct of its employees which amounts to unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Section 106 provides:
 
 
 '(1) Subject to subsection (2), where an employee or agent of a person does, in connection with the employment of the employee or with the duties of the agent as an agent: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) an act that would, if it were done by the person, be unlawful under Division 1 or 2 of Part II (whether or not the act done by the employee or agent is unlawful under Division 1 or 2 of Part II); or 
 (b) an act that is unlawful under Division 3 of Part II; 
 
 
 
 
 this Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an act of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b) done by an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing acts of the kind referred to in that paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 

24 Complaints in respect of 'unlawful discrimination' can be made to HREOC under s 46P of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Under s 3 of the HREOC Act, ' unlawful discrimination ' is relevantly defined as:
 
 '... any acts, omissions or practices that are unlawful under: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (c) Part II of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 ; 
 
 
 
 ...' 

25 Sections 28A and 28B fall within Pt II of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Section 106 is contained in Pt VI of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The respondent submits that that unlawful conduct arising under s 106 would not constitute unlawful discrimination for the purpose of making a complaint under s 46P of the HREOC Act, or for subsequent Court proceedings under s 46PO, because s 106 is not contained in Pt II of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">26 I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The conduct is not made unlawful by s 106 of the SDA, but rather by s 28B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The effect of s 106 is to deem the employer liable for the unlawful conduct committed by individual employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Section 28B falls within Pt II of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Accordingly a complaint relying upon s 106 is a complaint alleging ' unlawful discrimination ' as defined in s 3 of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">27 The appellant submits that Driver FM erred in suggesting that the appellant had to prove the liability of the respondent separately from the employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The appellant submits that, by virtue of s 106 of the SDA, the respondent's liability is deemed where an employee has engaged in unlawful conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Since Driver FM found as a matter of fact that there was a prima facie case against the individual employees, the appellant submits that it follows by virtue of s 106 that the appellant has made out a prima facie case against the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">28 However, the respondent submits that his Honour's finding that no prima facie case existed against the respondent was made on the basis that the individual employees alleged to have committed the unlawful acts were not parties to the proceedings, with the result that no findings and orders could be made against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The respondent says since no orders could be made against the individual employees, the respondent could not be vicariously liable for their conduct under s 106 and that s 106 makes an employer jointly, but not severally, liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It referred to O 6 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules which states that a party which is jointly but not severally liable for relief may apply for a stay of proceedings until all other persons jointly liable are joined to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">29 I agree with the submission of the appellant with respect to the effect of s 106 of the SDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">All that is required in order to make out a prima facie case against an employer is to establish a prima facie case against an employee of that employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Once established, the provisions of s 106 deem an employer liable without the need for an appellant to prove the elements of vicarious liability against the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">30 I also consider that an individual employee alleged to have engaged in unlawful discrimination need not be a party to a proceeding in order that the Court make a finding in respect of the lawfulness of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The words of s 106(1) that ' this Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act ' indicate that an employer is to be severally liable for the discriminatory conduct of its employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Such interpretation is supported by Gilroy v Angelov (2000) 181 ALR 57, in which Wilcox J made orders against an employer in circumstances where the employee was unable to be served with the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">31 This legislative scheme is consistent with common law principles of vicarious liability of employers for tortious conduct of employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In The Koursk [1924] P 140 Scrutton LJ said at 155:
 
 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by "joint tortfeasors"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">and one way of answering it is: "Is the cause of action against them the same?</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be "joint tortfeasors": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">These seem clearly joint tortfeasors; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with, another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">' 

32 This decision, which was applied in Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd and Ors [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 141 ALR 1, makes it clear that at common law, a vicariously liable employer is a joint tortfeasor with the employee against whom the tortious conduct is specifically alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22:
 
 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The plaintiff might sue any one of the tortfeasors separately for the full amount of the loss, or all of them jointly in the same action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">' 
 
 

Similar observations can be found in the judgment of Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">See also the discussion of vicarious liability in Pinecot Pty Ltd v Anti-Discrimination Commissioner [2001] NTSC 107 at [12] - [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">33 At common law joint tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for any loss occasioned by their tortious conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">It follows that an employee does not need to be joined into proceedings against an employer for conduct of that employee in respect of which the employer is vicariously liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The same effect is achieved by s 106 of HREOC Act in relation to an employer whose employee has engaged in unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">34 It follows from the above that Driver FM erred in his consideration of the merits of the appellant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">RE-EXERCISING THE DISCRETION 
 
35 The primary reasons for the denial of leave by Driver FM were the factors which were considered in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The errors in Driver FM's decision were errors of principle which materially affected the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Accordingly I consider his decision should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">36 In relation to prejudice, I do not consider there is any demonstrated prejudice to the respondent because of the delay of 58 days from the expiration of the prescribed period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I accept the finding of Driver FM that the explanation for the delay by the appellant is ' only partially convincing '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">However, I do not consider that the appellant could be said to have ' rested on his rights ' due to the delay between the date of termination of his complaint (1 June 2005) and 27 June 2005, being the date on which he made application to Legal Aid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Driver FM accepted that the subsequent delay was explained by matters relating to Legal Aid, which were beyond the control of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">37 As to the merits of the application, I see no reason to disturb the finding of Driver FM, who had all the relevant material before him, that the appellant had established a prima facie case against the employees of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">On the basis of such finding, I find that the appellant has established a prima facie case against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">38 Taking these factors into account, I consider that leave to bring the application out of time should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">
