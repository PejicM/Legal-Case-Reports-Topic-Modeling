 1 On 1 August 2008 I ordered that Robert John Boylan be substituted as plaintiff for Johnson Winter &amp; Slattery: see Johnson Winter &amp; Slattery in the matter of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 On 4 August 2008 I ordered that the defendant be wound up in insolvency and that Bryan Kenneth Hughes be liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These are the reasons why I made those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 The defendant is in voluntary administration by reason of a resolution of its sole director, Timothy Johnson, passed on 21 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Geoffrey David McDonald and Brent Kijurina, both of Hall Chadwick, were appointed voluntary administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They convened a meeting of creditors which was held on 31 July 2008 when the creditors decided not to oppose the making of a winding up order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 There is an outstanding issue, however, as to whether Bryan Kevin Hughes of Pitcher Partners, Perth, or Mr Kijurina should be appointed as liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Both have signed consents to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 The substituted plaintiff, Mr Boylan, seeks the appointment of Mr Hughes, whereas the defendant in voluntary administration seeks the appointment of Mr Kijurina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 Mr Kijurina's co-administrator, Mr McDonald, has appeared in person to assist the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In his capacity as a voluntary administrator, Mr McDonald has also been giving instructions on behalf of the defendant to the defendant's legal representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">7 In the earlier reasons for judgment I explained why I found that the defendant was insolvent and should be wound up, but deferred making the winding up order pending resolution of the issue as to who should be appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 Rolen Pty Ltd (Rolen), a company of which Ross John Graham is a director, claims to be a substantial creditor of the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Rolen lodged a proof of debt with the administrators in a sum of $11,162,230.83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Rolen is by far the largest creditor of the defendant that is not associated with Mr Johnston, a director and the controlling mind of the defendant (assuming that Rolen is a creditor at all - see below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">9 Mr Graham has proffered his personal undertaking to the Court to fund Mr Hughes up to an amount of $100,000 to investigate the affairs of the defendant and the recoverability of assets for the benefit of its creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Graham is not willing, however, to fund Mr Kijurina if he should be appointed liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 The argument put against Mr Hughes's appointment is that, according to the defendant, there will be a question whether the defendant is indebted to Rolen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr N J Kidd of counsel who appeared for the defendant was able to point to some evidence suggesting that the money that was paid by Rolen to the defendant was paid to it as share capital, not loan capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He submits that it would be unsatisfactory if Mr Hughes, having been nominated and funded by Mr Graham, was required to decide the question of indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">11 On the other side, Mr Kidd accepts that so far as the present evidence goes, Mr Kijurina is not funded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He suggests that it is early days and it may be that some creditors will come up with funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He submits that there ought to be an opportunity for this to happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 Mr J T Johnson, counsel for Mr Boylan, submits that there is no evidence that Mr Hughes will not act impartially in deciding the question whether Rolen is a creditor of the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">13 If one puts Rolen to one side, the larges two creditors of the defendant, according to an interim list of creditors dated 23 July 2008 prepared by the voluntary administrators, are Firepower Investments Pty Ltd and Green Triton Ltd, which are owed in all $13,037,662.00 out of total debts of $16,289,624.01 according.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Both of those companies are associated with and controlled by Mr Johnston,.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The submission that a particular liquidator is likely to be perceived to favour a particular creditor or particular creditors seems to be available in respect of Mr Kijurina, as much as it is in respect of Mr Hughes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 While in a perfect world it may be desirable that where there is a challenge to the indebtedness of the funding creditor, the issue be determined by a liquidator who has not been funded by that creditor, it should not be assumed that a liquidator who has been so funded will not perform the duties imposed on him or her by the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I note that the question of independence is discussed in Ch 6 of the Insolvency Practitioners Association's Code of Professional Practice for Insolvencies Professionals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
15 There is some cause for concern relating to the circumstances of the appointment of the present voluntary administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I am not suggesting invalidity of the appointment but circumstances which could dispose unrelated creditors against an appointment of Mr Kijurina as liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In the defendant's notice of appearance in this proceeding filed on 16 July 2008, the defendant opposed the application for winding up on, inter-alia, the ground that it was not insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I assume that Mr Johnston gave instructions to the solicitor who filed that notice of appearance to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Yet five days later, on 21 July 2008, Mr Johnston, in his capacity as sole director of the defendant, was able to resolve that it was the opinion of the Board constituted by himself that the defendant was likely to become insolvent at some future time .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It is plain that the defendant was already insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">16 The administrators themselves have been frustrated by Mr Johnston's failure to communicate with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">17 Of course, Mr Kijurina is not to be tarnished by Mr Johnston's having given the instructions to the solicitor and by his failure to communicate with the administrators, but it remains the case that the unrelated creditors may have a sense of grievance if Mr Kijurina is appointed liquidator in circumstances in which he and Mr McDonald were appointed as administrators by Mr Johnston and in which Mr Johnston's two companies mentioned would have majority voting power at a meeting of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">18 On the issue of utility/futility it was plainly desirable that Mr Hughes rather than Mr Kijurina be appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is true, as Mr Kidd pointed out, that given time another creditor or group of creditors may see fit to fund Mr Kijurina, but against that possibility it is to be weighed the present undertaking proffered to the Court by Mr Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">19 It was for the above reasons that I made orders on 4 August 2008 that the defendant be wound up and that Bryan Kevin Hughes be liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Associate:
