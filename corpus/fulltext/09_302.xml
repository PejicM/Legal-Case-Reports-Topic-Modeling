<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal from a decision ( House and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority (Cth) [2008] AATA 38) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") by which the Tribunal set aside the decision of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority ("the Authority") and substituted the following decision: For the purposes of section 34(1B)(a) of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 ("the Act"), alcoholism and the personality disorder of Mr House were the prescribed physical and mental impairments of the recipient member; and The percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of section 34(1) is 30%; and For the purposes of section 30 of the Act, the invalidity classification of Mr House is Class B with effect from 19 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">"Appeals" from decisions of the Tribunal pursuant to s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act") are on issues of law only, and fall within the original jurisdiction of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The orders sought by the Authority in this appeal are: That the determination of the Tribunal be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">That the reviewable decision before the Tribunal be affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Such other orders as the Court sees fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">No order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Background
 The respondent to these proceedings, Mr House, is a "recipient member" for the purposes of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">So far as is relevant for the purposes of this case, "recipient member" is defined by s 3 of the Act to mean "a member of the scheme who is entitled to retirement or invalidity pay".</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Mr House joined the armed forces on 1 October 1968 aged eighteen, and was retired on 29 May 1975 on the ground that "his retention in the Military Forces was not in the interests of those Forces".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In 1979 the Army Office informed the Authority that Mr House's mode of discharge had been changed to "medically unfit for further service" because of the impairments "alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease".</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 30 August 1985 the Authority decided under s 37 of the Act to treat Mr House as if he had retired on the ground of invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Since 1985 there have been numerous decisions in which Mr House's level of incapacity in relation to civil employment and his classification under s 30 of the Act have been reconsidered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">These decisions have been made by the Authority, on review by the Tribunal, and following appeals to the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">During that time Mr House's level of incapacity and classification under the Act has been assessed as follows: Of particular significance was the decision of the Tribunal immediately preceding the decision of the Tribunal the subject of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">That decision --- House and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2004] AATA 667 --- was upheld on appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court ( House v D.F.R.D.B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Authority [2004] FMCA 833).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I shall return to this decision later in the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The decision of the Authority
 The decision of the Authority which Mr House sought reviewed in the Tribunal stemmed from a request by Mr House in a letter dated 19 November 2004 seeking a review of his invalidity classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">At that time Mr House's invalidity classification referred to "alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease".</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr House requested that the invalidity classification extend to personality disorder and injuries he had sustained in a car accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 14 March 2005 the delegate of the Authority rejected the request for a review because, in summary, the additional conditions to which Mr House referred were not causally connected to his accepted impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, the delegate said that if Mr House considered that his accepted impairment had deteriorated since his last review he could request the Authority to conduct a review of his classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In letters to the Authority dated 18 March 2005 and 22 March 2005 Mr House requested reconsideration of the delegate's decision to decline his request for a review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Authority accepted these letters as a request for reconsideration of the delegate's decision and for review of Mr House's invalidity classification under s 34 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Authority found in summary as follows: In relation to Mr House's submission that the Authority had not previously considered whether a personality disorder should be recognised as part of the physical or mental impairment which was the cause of the incapacity by reason of which he had been retired from the Defence Force (that is, alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease); or whether a personality disorder was an impairment connected with such that impairment 
the Authority noted that it had extensively canvassed the question of a possible relationship between a personality disorder and alcoholism in Mr House's case in its decision dated 15 February 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In doing so, the Authority noted that it had considered and rejected the possibility that Mr House's personality disorder was causally connected with his alcoholism --- rather, the Authority had found that the better view was that Mr House's alcoholism was best viewed as a manifestation of a personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Accordingly, the Authority confirmed the decision of the delegate to refuse Mr House's request for a review of his classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal's decision the subject of this appeal (House [2008] AATA 38) 
 A person who is affected by a decision of the Authority and who is dissatisfied with the decision may request the Authority to reconsider the decision (s 99(2) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">An application may be made to the Tribunal to review a decision of the Authority, being a decision which has been confirmed or varied (s 99(6) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In this case Mr House sought review of the Authority's decision by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal considered in detail evidence given by Mr House, and by a psychologist, an occupational therapist, and a psychiatrist called as witnesses by Mr House.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal also considered in detail evidence given by a psychiatrist and an orthopaedic surgeon called as witnesses by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal found in summary as follows: The Tribunal's task was to decide the appropriate invalidity classification of Mr House on 19 November 2004, which was the date Mr House sought a review of his invalidity classification by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal was required to determine, as at 19 November 2004, the percentage of Mr House's incapacity in relation to civil employment, and the appropriate classification in respect of that incapacity for the purposes of s 30 and s 34 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal was required to give consideration to the impairment for which Mr House was retired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal found that the primary reason for Mr House's discharge was his alcoholism condition which was interrelated with his personality condition (at [90]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Accordingly, alcoholism was the prescribed physical or mental impairment for the purposes of s 34 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal was required to consider whether the personality disorder of Mr House should be accepted as being one of his prescribed physical or mental impairments which was a cause of the incapacity by reason of which he was retired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In so considering, the Tribunal found: It had long been recognised that Mr House had a personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">There was considerable medical evidence that this disorder was part of Mr House's "constitution", and that the personality disorder was present at the time of his enlistment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However under the scheme of the Act a constitutional condition may itself constitute a prescribed physical or mental impairment (at [94]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">This is recognised by s 28 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In order for the personality disorder of Mr House to constitute a prescribed impairment there must be some evidence that this condition rendered Mr House incapable of performing his duties (at [95]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Evidence that the personality disorder of Mr House could "impact" upon his employment was given by one of the psychiatrists, Dr Reddan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There was evidence before the Tribunal that the personality disorder of Mr House was a significant condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal interpreted evidence of Dr Reddan as meaning that Mr House's personality condition was as significant as the alcohol condition as an impairment, and that both conditions could impact on Mr House's employment (at [99)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that the personality disorder of Mr House was one cause of his retirement, and that for the purposes of s 34(1B)(a) of the Act, alcoholism and the personality disorder of Mr House were his prescribed physical and mental impairments (at [99]-[100]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Tribunal referred to s 34(1A) of the Act which provides that, in determining the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member, the Authority shall have regard to, inter alia , the kinds of civil employment which a person with skills, qualifications and experience referred to in s 34(1A)(a) of the Act might reasonably undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal accepted as relevant the kinds of civil employment submitted by the Authority, but also accepted a number of categories nominated by Mr House.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Specifically the Tribunal found that: 
...the kinds of civil employment which Mr House with skills, qualifications and experience referred to in section 34(1A)(a) of the Act might reasonably undertake would be as a driver, mobile plant operator, labourer, store person, mining and construction labourer, security officer, powder monkey, sub-contractor in mining and construction, and foreman in any of those fields.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(at [113])
 
 The Tribunal was required to have regard to the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of Mr House had diminished his capacity to undertake the kinds of civil employment accepted by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In this case the Tribunal noted that it would ordinarily examine the degree to which each prescribed impairment diminished the capacity of Mr House to undertake each of the relevant kinds of employment, but that in the circumstances it would be artificial to endeavour to determine the effect of each prescribed impairment (at [116]-[117]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In this case it would be inappropriate to simply perform a mathematical calculation by taking an average of various percentages of impairment for the kinds of employment listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Tribunal also noted that it was administering beneficial legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It was appropriate for the Tribunal to make a "value judgment" as described in McGovern and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority (1988) 16 ALD 791.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal accepted that Mr House was able to drive, that the alcoholism condition of Mr House was in remission, and that Dr Reddan had given Mr House a 30% rating on two kinds of civil employment that Mr House could reasonably undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Tribunal found that the percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of s 34(1) was 30% (at [121]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Accordingly, the Tribunal found that Mr House had a classification of Class B for the purposes of s 30 of the Act, such classification to take effect from 19 November 2004, and made the orders the subject of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Appeal
 I have already set out the orders sought by the Authority in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The questions of law raised on the appeal are whether the Tribunal erred at law in: 
(1) Failing to consider a serious submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(2) Failing to take into account a relevant consideration, ie that the applicant's condition had improved since 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">(3) Failing to take into account a relevant consideration, ie that a person with the applicant's skills, qualifications and experience would reasonably be expected to undertake a wider range of civil employment than security officer and foreman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">(4) Misdirecting itself as to the nature of the decision it was required to make, or misapplied s 34(1) of the Act; and
 
(5) Making a statement of reasons that was manifestly inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I am satisfied that these are proper questions of law for consideration by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The grounds of appeal of the Authority are as follows: The Tribunal erred in law in not considering a serious submission of the applicant that, adopting the principle that having regard to the dictates of fairness and expedition "previous Tribunal decisions should generally be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and the grounds for determination unless there is reason not to do so": Re Quinn &amp; Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 15 AAR 519 at 526, the question for the Tribunal is what has changed since the operative date for the previous Tribunal determination of the respondent's incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration, ie that the respondent's condition had improved since 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Tribunal was required to take into account this consideration by s 34(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration, ie that a person with the applicant's skills, qualifications and experience would reasonably be expected to undertake a wider range of civil employment than security officer and foreman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Under s 34(1)(c) of the Act the Tribunal made its assessment of the degree to which the prescribed impairment of the respondent had diminished his capacity to undertake the kinds of employment identified for the purposes of s 34(1)(b) of the Act by reference to only two of the nine identified employment kinds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Tribunal erred in law by misdirecting itself as to the nature of the decision it was required to make, or misapplied s 34(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Tribunal said that it was "required to have regard to the width, quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities and make a 'value judgment'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">But it then made its decision on the assessment of only two of nine identified employment types.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Tribunal's statement of reasons was manifestly inadequate in that it: is impossible to glean from the statement the reasons what was the Tribunal's reasoning process that led to its decisions; and does not state reasons adequate to enable the court to determine whether or not any other error had occurred in the reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Relevant legislative scheme
 The governing law in these proceedings is Pt V of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Part V provides invalidity benefits for members of the scheme established by the Act who have been retired on the ground of invalidity or physical or mental incapacity to perform their duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The initial classification of a member is made under s 30, which provides as follows: 
 30 (1) Where a member of the scheme, not being a member of the scheme to whom section 36 applies, is, or is about to become, entitled to invalidity benefit, the Authority shall determine his percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment and shall classify him according to the percentage of incapacity as follows: 

 
 Percentage of incapacity 
 Class 
 
 60% or more 
 A 
 
 30% or more but less than 60% 
 B 
 
 Less than 30% 
 C 
 
 In its Reasons for Decision the Tribunal also referred to s 34 of the Act, which so far as is relevant in these proceedings provides: 
 34 (1) The Authority may, from time to time, if it is satisfied that the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member in receipt of invalidity pay is such that the classification of the member should be altered, reclassify him in the appropriate classification set out in section 30 according to the percentage of his incapacity in relation to civil employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">

 
 ... 

 
 (1A) In determining: 

(aa)What is the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member;...
 
(aab)
 
 
The Authority shall have regard to the following matters only:
 
(a) the vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience of the recipient member ; 
 
(b) the kinds of civil employment which a person with skills, qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph (a) might reasonably undertake; 
 
(c) the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of the recipient member, being a prescribed physical or mental impairment, has or had diminished the capacity of the recipient member to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph (b);
 
(d) such other matters (if any) as are prescribed for the purposes of this subsection
 
 
 (1B) In subsection (1A), prescribed physical or mental impairment , in relation to a recipient member or a deceased member who was immediately before his or her death a recipient member, means: 

(a) a physical or mental impairment of the member that was the cause, or one of the causes, of the invalidity or physical or mental incapacity by reason of which the member was retired, whether or not that impairment changed, for better or worse, since that retirement; or
 
(b) any other physical or mental impairment of the member causally connected with a physical or mental impairment referred to in paragraph (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Submissions of the parties
 Both oral and written submissions were made by the parties in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In summary, the Authority submitted as follows: Mr Harding, appearing on behalf of Mr House, submitted in summary: Principles relevant to appeals to this Court from Tribunal decisions were explained in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic [1993] FCA 456 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 286-287.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">These principles include the following: a wrong finding of fact is not sufficient to demonstrate error of law; only in exceptional circumstances should the decision of the Tribunal not be the final decision; the Court will not be concerned with looseness in the language of the Tribunal nor with unhappy phrasing of the Tribunal's thoughts; the reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye attuned to the perception of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In relation to the Authority's claim that the Tribunal erred by revisiting findings of fact already made by the Tribunal in House [2004] AATA 667 and by not taking that decision into account, in fact the Tribunal made key findings on critical issues which differed from those of the earlier Tribunal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Accordingly, the decision of the Tribunal in House [2004] AATA 667 was made redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Specifically: in House [2004] AATA 667 , the Tribunal had found that the incapacity by reason of which Mr House was retired was the effects of alcoholism and that Mr House's prescribed physical and mental impairments were alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease, and not his personality disorder; in the decision the subject of this appeal, the Tribunal found that alcoholism and the personality disorder of Mr House were the prescribed physical and mental impairments; the Tribunal in the decision the subject of this appeal recognised it faced different evidence and different issues as to the kinds of civil employment which a person with the applicant's skills, qualification and experience might reasonably undertake; the fact that the 2004 decision of the Tribunal was upheld by the Federal Magistrates Court in House [2004] FMCA 833 is irrelevant --- it simply means that, in the view of the Federal Magistrates Court, the earlier decision of the Tribunal was not infected by legal error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In relation to the Authority's submission that the Tribunal had failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely that Mr House's condition had improved, any comparison between Mr House's level of functioning at the effective date of the Tribunal's decision and earlier points in time must recognise that, until the Tribunal's decision, Mr House's personality disorder had not been considered to be one of his prescribed physical and mental impairments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In relation to the Authority's submission that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations as to the kind of employment Mr House could undertake in determining Mr House's overall incapacity for civil employment, the Authority was inviting the Court to consider the Tribunal's reasons "minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error".</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In relation to the Authority's submission as to misdirection, that submission does not take the Authority's case any further than other grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In relation to the Authority's submission as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to give adequate reasons, in relation to the issues which the Authority raised the Tribunal was not required to expressly give an explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Tribunal made findings with reasons in respect of each of the issues under s 34 of the Act in compliance with s 43(2B) AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Tribunal was required to make a global assessment, such an assessment is not a mathematical exercise, and a precise identification of how the Tribunal arrived at 30% incapacity is not necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Because the decision as to Mr House's degree of incapacity is a "value judgment", not a mathematical exercise, if the Court upholds the Authority's appeal the appropriate course is for the Court to remit the matter to the Tribunal as the arbiter of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Consideration
 First ground of appeal
 The first ground of appeal concerns the alleged error of the Tribunal in not taking into account a serious submission of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The "serious submission" of the Authority was, in summary, that the question whether Mr House's physical or mental impairment did or did not include a personality disorder had already been the subject of consideration and findings by both the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is clear on reading the decision of Emmett FM in House [2004] FMCA 833 that the issue of Mr House's personality disorder had been raised in the proceedings both before the Tribunal in its 2004 proceedings and in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In this context it is useful to set out comments by her Honour in House [2004] FMCA 833 with respect to this issue: 
 "New grounds of Appeal 

 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Appellant argued orally that the Tribunal had further erred: 

 
a) in seeking to separate his personality disorder from his alcoholism and thereby discount by half the assessment of the Appellant's impairment in circumstances where that exercise had not been undertaken in any prior determination;
 
 
b) in failing to find that the Appellant's personality disorder had been part of the reason for his discharge from the Armed Forces in May 1975 and therefore part of the physical or mental incapacity for which he was retired and therefore not able to be separated or discounted from his alcoholism; and
 
 
c) in that the Tribunal's finding that the Appellant's alcoholism and personality disorder could be separated such that the percentage of the incapacity from impairment that was a cause of his retirement was halved was a finding so repugnant to the evidence as to amount to an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Leave was then sought by the Appellant to further amend his Amended Notice of Appeal to raise those further alleged errors of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Leave was opposed by the Respondent on the basis that there had been ample time for the Appellant to seek leave prior to the hearing, that the Appellant had already amended his Notice of Appeal once and that in any event the grounds were so unlikely to succeed as to render leave futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">

 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In considering the question of leave, I have had regard to the submissions by the parties on the further grounds sought to be raised by the Appellant with a view to determining the likelihood of success of any of the further grounds raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">

 
 (a) Was it open to the Tribunal to discount the percentage of incapacity of alcoholism to take account of personality disorder 

 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Before the Tribunal, the Appellant relied on the evidence of Dr J. Hargraves psychiatrist who had been treating the Appellant since January 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Dr Hargraves evidence was relied on in relation to the involvement of his personality disorder with the identified impairment of his alcoholism and the inability to distinguish the two impairments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">

 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The Respondent relied on reports of Doctors Reddan and Stevenson as enabling the Tribunal to consider objectively the separation of the two conditions and to seek to deal with the personality disorder separately from the alcoholism by way of discounting the incapacity of the alcoholism by the personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Tribunal had regard to Dr Hargraves opinion that the Appellant suffers from alcoholism and personality disorder (para 21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">

 
 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It is common ground that personality disorder of the Appellant has been found by previous Tribunal decisions not to be a prescribed impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The Tribunal concluded that the prescribed physical or mental impairment in the Appellant's case is alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">

 
 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Tribunal found that "the respondent conceded that the impairment by reason of which the applicant was retired were alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease and this aspect is not in issue".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(para 11) 

 
 25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Tribunal concluded in paragraph 53 that: 

 
 "Dr Hargraves has not opined that the cessation of work was entirely due to the effect of alcoholism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Consequently, whilst the applicant seeks to connect the cessation of work with the correlating escalation in the degree of his impairments, the Tribunal finds that this approach is misdirected and without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is clear from the reports of Dr Stevenson and Dr Reddan that an objective approach is warranted and this Tribunal agrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">" 

 
 In paragraph 34 the Tribunal said: 

 
 "Dr Reddan acknowledges the artificiality of separating the symptoms produced by alcohol abuse and personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">" 

 
 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">On the other hand, Dr Hargraves report took into account both the Appellant's personality disorder and his alcoholism in assessing the incapacity of the Appellant to undertake to the Accepted Kinds of Employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">

 
 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Dr Reddan, in her report at page 815, states: 

 
 "I think that people with personality disorder seem to be more prone to alcohol abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">" 

 
 At AB 817 Dr Reddan was asked in chief: 

 
 "If you were asked to look at Mr House and say, leaving aside the effect of his personality order, what effect does the alcohol abuse have on his capacity to undertake both kinds of employments we have identified?</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Is it possible can you make an assessment of just the effect of the alcohol abuse?</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">" 

 
 Answer: 

 
 "Well, it is artificial and its difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">As I said in that report things like attending work intoxicated or other sequelae of alcohol abuse I suppose we should say might have certain sequelae for some jobs but not for others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">So the sort of percentages I was sort of estimating then were really when you kind of combine the two together and I think you'd really have to kind of almost if you assign a percentage you'd almost sort of have to harvest in each case in relation to personality or alcohol but it's a somewhat artificial kind of distinction that in real life isn't quite right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" 

 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Having regard to the finding of the Tribunal in respect of the separation of the personality disorder from alcoholism and the consequent halving of the impairment, the Tribunal clearly acknowledges the evidence of Dr Reddan that there is an artificiality in separating the symptoms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Whilst I may not necessarily have come to the same conclusion, it is clear that the Tribunal's finding was open to it on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">" 

 
 [29] Further, in submissions before the Tribunal, the Respondent clearly invited the Tribunal to discount the incapacity arising from the Appellant's personality disorder although at the same time making it clear to the Tribunal that that was not an exercise that had been done before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">

 
 [30] The Appellant did not seek to address that submission in any way at the hearing and states today that it was because neither he nor his representative had expected such a submission to be put and did not expect the Tribunal to make a finding in accordance with that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The Appellant stated today that the matter did not concern him at the time as he was of the view that it had not been possible on the medical evidence to date, and particularly in relation to Dr Hargraves evidence, to separate the alcoholism from the personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">That is unfortunate and I have a deal of sympathy for the Appellant in perhaps failing to challenge those submissions when he had the opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However, it cannot be said that opportunity was denied him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">

 I have set out these observations of her Honour in some detail to illustrate the point that the submission of the Authority before me has substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It is unnecessary for me, in these proceedings, to look further into previous deliberations and decisions of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The submission of the Authority in relation to its submission before the Tribunal in these proceedings is that the issue whether Mr House has a personality disorder has previously been before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The excerpts from her Honour's judgment and the reasons for decision of the Tribunal in House and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority [2004] AATA 667 support this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In re Quinn &amp; Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 15 AAR 519 at 526 the Tribunal stated: 
 It would seem inappropriate and unreasonable to us for there to be relitigation without reason of the same issues before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It would be unjust to applicants to have to face a situation where a decision may be made today and relitigated tomorrow on the very same facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Tribunal should not generally allow relitigation of issues already decided and previous Tribunal decisions should be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and of the grounds for the determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">

 That this principle applies in relation to decisions of the Tribunal appears settled law: Comcare Australia v Grimes [1994] FCA 1054 at [24] , Cheung v AAT [2009] FCA 241 at [49] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">In affirming the principle, the Full Court in Morales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 82 FCR 374 said at 390: 
 In our view, the essentially administrative nature of the Tribunal's function and the nature of its task in looking to the correct or preferable decision, in circumstances where it is to have regard amongst other things to the dictates of fairness, point to the conclusion that the Tribunal may, in appropriate circumstances, conclude that a previous decision should be applied again as the correct and preferable decision when it is sought to revisit the earlier decision at some later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Of course, the circumstance that a Court has set aside an entire decision may mean that it is either impermissible, or quite inappropriate, to adopt such a course but that would not necessarily be the case where, as here, a particular determination had not itself been the subject of challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

 
 In the present case, we think it was open to Purvis J, having considered all the relevant circumstances, to regard the previous decision of Mr McMahon as determinative of the s 501(2) issue and to decide that this issue should not be reopened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Of course, his Honour might have concluded that this course was not appropriate in the circumstances; but it was a matter of discretion and his Honour's reasons lead us to conclude that he did not see himself as having such discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">In this respect there was an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

 Clearly a failure by the Tribunal to advert to the content of submissions does not of itself necessarily mean that the matter was not considered ( Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 279, Australian Postal Corporation v Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [35] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However in this case, aside from a bare reference by the Tribunal to the existence of its 2004 decision (at [4]), there is no indication that it had taken into consideration the submission of the Authority concerning previous consideration by the Tribunal of issues relating to Mr House's personality disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">This absence of reference to its earlier decision is particularly surprising where the Tribunal has found that Mr House had greater incapacity than that found by the Tribunal in 2004, notwithstanding the evidence before the Tribunal in these proceedings that, between August 2001 and November 2004, inter alia , Mr House had stopped drinking ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [15] ), was no longer an active alcoholic ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [52] ), and Mr House was maturing and less affected by his personality disorder ( House [2008] AATA 38 at [60] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In my view this is not a case where the Court can infer that the Tribunal has considered the issue raised by the submission without referring directly to it, or used loose language in addressing the submission made by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The law is clear that failure to consider a submission of substance which, if accepted, would be capable of affecting the outcome of the case, constitutes an error of law ( Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; Casarotto v Australian Postal Corporation [1989] FCA 116 ; (1989) 86 ALR 399 at 403; Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v FCT (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276; Sellick [2008] FCA 236 at [35] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Was the submission of the Authority in relation to previous consideration of the issue of Mr House's personality disorder a submission of substance?</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In my view it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">While the Tribunal was not necessarily bound by its early decision --- indeed the decision of the Full Court in Morales (1998) 82 FCR 374 indicates that the issue was one of discretion --- nevertheless the submission should have been considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Failure by the Tribunal to do so in my view constitutes an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Second and third grounds of appeal
 The second and third grounds of appeal concern the alleged error of the Tribunal in not taking into account two relevant considerations, namely that: An administrative decision can be impugned on the basis of error if the decision-maker has failed to take into account a consideration which the subject matter, scope and purpose of a statute indicates was necessary to be considered: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In relation to the submission of the Authority that the Tribunal failed to take into account the improvement in Mr House's condition, I accept the contention that the Tribunal was required, in assessing the percentage of incapacity of Mr House, to take into consideration whether or not Mr House's incapacity for civil employment had changed since he or she was last classified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">That this is a relevant consideration follows from a plain reading of s 34(1) of the Act: 
 The Authority may, from time to time , if it is satisfied that the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member in receipt of invalidity pay is such that the classification of the member should be altered , reclassify him in the appropriate classification set out in section 30 according to the percentage of his incapacity in relation to civil employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">(emphasis added) 

 The weight the Tribunal gives to such an issue is for the Tribunal as arbiter of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Nonetheless improvement in the condition of Mr House was a relevant consideration, as defined in Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In my view Mr Harding's submission in relation to this issue seeks merely to rationalise the failure by the Tribunal to take into account evidence of Mr House's improvement, and does not answer the claim of the Authority in relation to this aspect of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Further, in relation to the submission of the Authority as to the kinds of civil employment taken into account by the Tribunal, s 34(1A) of the Act provides that, in determining what is the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment, the Authority shall have regard to, inter alia , the following matters: 
 (b) the kinds of civil employment which [such a person as Mr House, having his] skills, qualifications and experience might reasonably undertake; 

 
 (c) the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of the recipient member, being a prescribed physical or mental impairment, has or had diminished the capacity of the recipient member to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">

 Accordingly, the Authority, and the Tribunal, are required to identify the kinds of civil employment that a person such as Mr House might reasonably undertake with his skills, qualifications and experience, and then to determine his level of incapacity for those kinds of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In relation to the incapacity of Mr House for each kind of employment the Tribunal found as follows: 
 I accept the evidence of Dr Reddan who gave an opinion of percentages of incapacity which are mentioned in the report of 1 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Dr Reddan took account of the alcohol condition as well as the personality disorder condition in providing her opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">These percentages are driver, minimal, 5% (which Dr Reddan conceded could be increased to 10%); mobile plant operator, minimal, 5%; labourer, minimal, 5%; storeman, minimal, 5%; mining and construction labourer, small, 15%; security officer, moderate, 30%; powder monkey, small, 20%; sub-contractor in mining and construction, small, 20%; foreman in any of these fields, moderate, 30%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">( House [2008] AATA 38 at [117] ) 

 The Authority submitted that the conclusion of the Tribunal that therefore Mr House's level of incapacity for civil employment was 30% suggested that the Tribunal had only taken into consideration the levels of incapacity for security officer and foreman (evidence of Dr Reddan in relation to both kinds of employment indicating 30% incapacity).</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In my view this submission raises a serious question as to whether the Tribunal actually did take into consideration evidence before it of the levels of incapacity of Mr House in relation to all kinds of employment listed, and not merely the levels of incapacity in relation to security officer and foreman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The fact that, in relation to the other seven kinds of civil employment listed, the evidence accepted by the Tribunal was that Mr House's incapacity ranged from 5% to 20%, means that the finding by the Tribunal of 30% incapacity warrants some explanation of the process of reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Unfortunately, in my view such explanation as there is in the Tribunal's statement of reasons is inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The Tribunal leaps directly to the conclusion on the basis of a "value judgment" that the percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of s 34(1) of the Act is 30%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I reject the submission on behalf of Mr House that criticism of the Tribunal's reasoning in this context is examination "minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error".</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">With respect, the conclusion of the Tribunal supports the Authority's submission that a relevant consideration, namely the evidence as to the levels of incapacity in respect of kinds of employment other than security officer and foreman, was not considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Failure of the Tribunal to take into account the relevant considerations to which I have referred is an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Fourth ground of appeal
 This ground of appeal adds very little to the Authority's submissions concerning the failure of the Tribunal to take into account relevant considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">To the extent however that the Tribunal (after referring to McGovern and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority (1988) 16 ALD 791 at 792) stated that it was required to have regard to the width, quality and nature of the range of employment opportunities and make a "value judgment", it appeared that the Tribunal actually did not have regard to the "width, quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">As I have already noted, it appears that the Tribunal in making its decision as to the level of incapacity took into consideration only two of the nine employment types.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It follows therefore that the Tribunal did not follow the procedure it outlined for itself as necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In this respect the Tribunal appears to have made an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Fifth ground of appeal
 Mr Harding on behalf of Mr House submitted that the Tribunal made findings in respect of each of the issues under s 34 of the Act, was required to make a global assessment which is not a mathematical exercise, and was not required to give detailed explanation of the manner in which it arrived at its conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">While this may be true as a general proposition, nonetheless in my view some explanation is required where the Tribunal appears to make decisions which appear contrary to the weight of evidence, as is the case in relation to the Tribunal's value judgment that Mr House's level of incapacity for civil employment was 30%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">I note again that the only explanation given by the Tribunal was as follows: 
 PERCENTAGE OF INCAPACITY OF CIVIL EMPLOYMENT 

 
 121.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to simply perform a " mathematical calculation " by taking an average of the various percentages of impairment for the kinds of employment listed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I am also conscious that I am administering beneficial legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I accept the fact that Mr House is able to drive as he regularly drives his partner to appointments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">I also accept the evidence of Dr John Morris who has made a realistic assessment of the ability of Mr House to be a driver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I also accept that the alcohol condition of Mr House is now in remission and Mr House is to be commended for his responsible attitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I have already mentioned that in McGovern Deputy President R D Nicholson has stated that I am required to have regard to the width, quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities and make a " value judgment ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">I have had regard to the fact that Dr Reddan, who has been called by the Authority has given Mr House a 30% rating on two kinds of civil employment that Mr House could reasonably undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Making a " value judgment " I find that the percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of section 34(1) of the Act is 30%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">

 In my view, in the circumstances the Tribunal's statement of reasons were inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I accept the Authority's submission that these reasons do not satisfy the test in Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (No 1) [1987] FCA 301 ; (1987) 77 ALR 577 , namely that the unsuccessful party, having read the decision, must be in a position to say: 
 Even though I may not agree with it, now I understand why the decision went against me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I am now in a position to decide whether that decision has involved an unwarranted finding of fact, or an error of law, which is worth challenging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">( Our Town FM Pty Ltd [1987] FCA 301 ; (1987) 77 ALR 577 at 593) 

 With respect, I do not consider it possible to understand the reasoning process of the Tribunal in assessing Mr House's level of incapacity at 30% from the statement of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Nor are the reasons adequate to enable the Court to determine whether or not any other error had occurred in the reasoning process (cf Doman v Riordan (1990) 21 ALD 255 at 256).</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Tribunal has not given reasons for its decision as required by s 43(2) AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">This fatally infects the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Conclusion
 The appeal should be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">However I accept the submission of Mr Harding that it is not appropriate for this Court to merely affirm the decision of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That would result in the Court, in effect, substituting its own decision on the matter under review by the Tribunal (cf Dixon v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCAFC 54 at [26] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The appropriate order is that the decision of the Tribunal be set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">No order is made as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
