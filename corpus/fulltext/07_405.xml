 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Ashley Holt was previously employed in a Commonwealth agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He lives in Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He suffered a compensable injury in the course of his employment on 17 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Comcare on behalf of the Commonwealth has paid compensation to him under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (the SRC Act) since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr Holt's injury was described as "generalised anxiety disorder and adjustment reaction with brief depressive reaction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Mr Holt has been treated for the condition by a general practitioner, Dr Zerk, for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 In August 2005, Dr Zerk requested the approval of Comcare for Mr Holt to attend a Buddhist meditation retreat at the Chenrezig Institute in Queensland (the retreat) as part of his treatment for his injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That involved a cost of a little over $1000 for food and accommodation, and air fares of almost $600 to enable Mr Holt to travel between his home in Alice Springs and Brisbane, near where the retreat was to take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Comcare, by its delegate, decided on 22 August 2005 that Comcare would not pay for the attendance at the retreat or the expenses of the retreat, because the retreat did not constitute "therapeutic treatment" as defined in the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That decision was confirmed on internal review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Holt challenged that decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 However, before the AAT it was accepted that the retreat did constitute "therapeutic treatment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The sole issue before the AAT was whether the retreat was treatment "that is reasonable for the employee to obtain in the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The AAT on 8 December 2006 set aside the decision of Comcare of 22 August 2005, and substituted a decision that Comcare is liable to pay compensation to Mr Holt under s 16 of the SRC Act for his reasonable costs of attendance for, and at, the retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 Comcare appeals under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) from that decision of the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This appeal concerns the proper construction and application of the words in s 16(1) of the SRC Act describing when Comcare must pay medical treatment in respect of a compensable injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">THE LEGISLATION 
 
6 Section 14(1) of the SRC Act makes Comcare liable to pay compensation in accordance with the SRC Act in respect of an injury suffered by an employee which results in death, incapacity for work or an impairment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Section 4(1) defines "injury" to include a disease suffered by an employee, and "disease" is also defined in s 4(1) to include any ailment suffered by an employee or an aggravation of such an ailment, provided that the ailment or its aggravation was contributed to in a material degree by the employment by the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 The provisions relevant to this particular matter commence with s 16(1) of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It provides:
 
 Where an employee suffers an injury, Comcare is liable to pay, in respect of the cost of medical treatment obtained in relation to the injury (being treatment that it was reasonable for the employee to obtain in the circumstances), compensation of such amount as Comcare determines is appropriate to that medical treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

This appeal turns upon whether it was reasonable for Mr Holt to undertake the retreat in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 The term "medical treatment" is defined in s 4(1) of the Act to include:
 
 "therapeutic treatment obtained at the direction of a legally qualified medical practitioner".</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

The term "therapeutic treatment" is also defined in s 4(1) to include:
 
 "an examination, test or analysis done for the purpose of diagnosing, or treatment given for the purpose of alleviating, an injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">"
 

As noted, it was accepted before the AAT that the retreat was treatment given for the purpose of alleviating Mr Holt's injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 Section 16(6) provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation to an employee where compensation is payable in respect of the cost of medical treatment and the 
 
 employee reasonably incurs expenditure in ... making a necessary journey for the purpose of obtaining that medical treatment [and/or] remaining, for the purpose of obtaining that medical treatment, at a place to which the employee has made a journey for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">

If, as the AAT found, the retreat was reasonable to be undertaken in the circumstances, Comcare does not separately contend that the travel costs were themselves unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Correctly, in my view, both Comcare and Mr Holt regarded the overall cost of the retreat and the travel to it as matters relevant to the reasonableness of the retreat as treatment in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The amount of compensation payable is fixed by s 16(6)(c) and (d).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Section 16(7) limits the circumstances in which Comcare is liable to pay compensation by reference to the length of the journey and the consequences of the employee's injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Nothing turns upon those latter mentioned provisions in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">THE AAT DECISION 
 
10 Mr Holt is a practising Buddhist, and has been engaged in meditation for some 30 years and has attended about 40 meditation training sessions over the years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He has previously had similar treatment to the retreat, that is therapeutic meditation sessions, paid for by Comcare in November 2002, September 2003, March 2004, November 2004 and April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He meditates on a daily basis and has a room at his home generally available for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He claimed that attendance at the retreat had in the past provided him with the opportunity to practise intensively in a supportive environment, and that the benefit of such a retreat can last upwards of 11 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He also claimed that his stress levels build up as time elapses from the retreat, and that he loses focus and quality of life over that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He said that it is the supportive environment of the retreat that makes the difference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The AAT accepted his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 The AAT also noted that his treating practitioner, Dr Zerk, regarded the attendance at the retreat as having a therapeutic benefit for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It referred to comments Dr Zerk had made to that effect in May 2005, and August 2005 including, in respect of the present application, that:
 
 Mr Holt is getting benefits from these treatments ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I note that in particular after attending Buddhist retreats, Mr Holt comes back refreshed, relaxed, less stressed and 'bogged down' with the problems relating to his claim, and ready to find employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The benefit gained from this is clear, but difficult to sustain unless he can see a brighter future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">

12 The Tribunal then described the argument for Comcare as being that the treatment was not treatment that was reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There were two reasons put forward for that:
 
 (1) that Mr Holt could in effect replicate the retreat in his own home; and
 (2) that there were other forms of meditation treatment available in Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

The Tribunal did not accept either of those arguments, as it said, because "there is an inadequate evidential foundation for them or either of them".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It explained that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">13 Comcare, as to the first argument, pointed to the fact that Mr Holt had already attended five similar retreats, his extensive experience in meditation, his contacts with leaders at the Chenrezig Institute who could advise him at home and his home facilities including a supportive partner and a room dedicated to enabling him to undertake meditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">14 
 
The AAT described those contentions as having "a superficial appeal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It concluded that the argument overlooked the fact that there is evidence of demonstrated therapeutic benefit in attendance at the Chenrezig Institute for the retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It noted that there was no evidence to suggest that a similar, or any other, benefit would flow from Mr Holt seeking to replicate the treatment in his own home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The evidence before the AAT had included a report from another doctor touching on that issue, but Comcare did not rely upon that evidence before the AAT for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It therefore concluded that the "home meditation" alternative propounded by Comcare did not provide a therapeutic benefit that is comparable with attendance at the Chenrezig Institute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">15 That was a decision of fact available to the AAT on the evidence, and indeed counsel for Comcare properly acknowledged that it could not be challenged on this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">16 As to the alternative argument, the only evidence was an extract from an internet search of the Australian Buddhist Directory which indicated that there is a Buddhist Society of the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It said that intensive meditation sessions (retreats) are organised on a monthly basis and that that Society tries to arrange visits within the Territory, including to Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Comcare argued that, having sent that information to Mr Holt's solicitors, Mr Holt was obliged to investigate the possibilities of undertaking a retreat through that body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">17 The Tribunal did not accept that argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It said:
 
 There is no concept of persuasive onus in proceedings in this Tribunal but there is certainly an evidentiary onus upon a party who wishes to argue that one treatment option is unreasonable when compared to another to properly evidence the suggested alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I do not consider the passage I have set out [the information referred to] to provide a sound evidentiary foundation from which I could conclude that the Northern Territory Buddhist Society offers a more reasonable alternative treatment that would assist the applicant with his accepted condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

18 Having rejected those two arguments of Comcare, the Tribunal continued:
 
 Against a background where the medical evidence is that attendance at the retreat in the past has a demonstrated therapeutic benefit, where prior attendances have been funded by the respondent and where no equally efficacious alternative at a lower cost is suggested, I conclude that attendance by the applicant at the Buddhist retreat does amount to medical treatment that it was reasonable for the applicant to obtain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">

19 Comcare placed particular emphasis upon the concluding remarks of the AAT, after it had formally set aside the decision of Comcare and substituted the decision that Comcare is liable to pay the reasonable costs of Mr Holt's attendance at the retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">That passage is as follows:
 
 I should add, against the possibility that this might be thought to open the floodgates, that I regard this decision as turning very much upon its own facts and, in particular, evidentiary deficits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">As it seems to me if the respondent wishes to argue that a particular treatment is unreasonable, there is an obligation upon it to demonstrate an alternative that has equivalent therapeutic benefit but at a lower cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">That, in my view, was not done here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 THE CONTENTIONS 
 
20 There were three arguments advanced by Comcare on the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">They were:
 
 (1) The AAT had not applied the principles discussed by Stone J in Comcare v Rope [2004] FCA 540 ; (2004) 135 FCR 443 at 448, at [17], and in particular that it did not consider the prospective benefits of the proposed treatment against its prospective costs, that is that it did not weigh the benefit of the retreat against the cost of obtaining it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It was said that the AAT erred by proceeding on the basis that in the absence of a cheaper alternative, the treatment was reasonable, because it failed to consider whether the cost of the proposed treatment was reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">That was said to be a failure to take material facts into account and to examine them in relation to a matter the Tribunal had to determine so as to amount to an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">(2) The AAT took into account irrelevant considerations, namely that Comcare had previously funded such medical treatment, and secondly that Comcare had an obligation upon it to demonstrate an alternative medical treatment that has equivalent therapeutic benefit but at a lower cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">(3) The AAT failed to comply with the obligation imposed by s 43(2) of the AAT Act and failed to deal with a submission seriously advanced by Comcare, relevant to the issue before the Tribunal and worthy of consideration, namely that any benefit Mr Holt obtained from the medical treatment was outweighed by the cost of treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">As to the third argument, Comcare's statement of facts and contentions before the AAT included the proposition that any benefit to Mr Holt from attending the retreat was outweighed by the cost of obtaining the treatment (as the AAT noted about $1650).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It was contended that Comcare's contention in that regard was not addressed in the AAT's reasons at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 CONSIDERATION 
 
21 Counsel for the parties were agreed on the principles to be applied in determining whether the proposed treatment was reasonable for Mr Holt to obtain in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In Rope 135 FCR at 448, at [17], Stone J said:
 
 I accept, however, that the reference in s 16(1) to treatment being 'reasonable to obtain in the circumstances' is a clear indication that, in this case, the Tribunal was required to engage in a costs/benefit analysis in relation to PNI treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Tribunal needed, among other things, to weigh the benefit of PNI treatment against the cost of obtaining it (given that the treatment was available only in Townsville), taking into account any other treatment available to Mrs Rope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">

22 In that case, the employee had suffered a compensatable injury and had received psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) treatment from a psychotherapist in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The psychotherapist had subsequently moved her practice to Townsville and the issue was whether the employee was entitled to recover from Comcare the costs of her travel to Townsville to continue her PNI treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">There was no equivalent treatment available in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The AAT determined that it was reasonable for that employee to obtain PNI treatment and be reimbursed for the cost of travelling to Townsville to obtain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Justice Stone found no error of law on the part of the AAT in making that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">23 Coincidentally, in that case, the argument of Comcare significantly resembles its argument in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It was argued that the AAT had failed to engage in a costs/benefit analysis in determining that it was reasonable for that employee to obtain PNI treatment in Townsville.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Justice Stone concluded that the findings of the Tribunal were open to it on the evidence and provided no basis for the Court to interfere with those findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Her Honour said, after accepting that there was predominant medical opinion that the proposed PNI treatment had therapeutic value for that employee because it assisted her in managing the pain of her injury and improved her quality of life, at 448, at [19]:
 
 the only additional factor to be considered was whether there was any equivalent treatment available in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Tribunal stated that Comcare had 'failed to substantiate its assertion that equivalent treatment to that provided to [the employee] is available in Canberra'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I am satisfied that the Tribunal did consider all the circumstances that, under s 16(1), it was required to consider in determining if it was reasonable for [the employee] to obtain PNI treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The findings that the Tribunal made were open to it on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is not for this Court to interfere with those findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">

24 The first contention is based upon the observations of the AAT set out in [19] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">25 I agree that it would have been erroneous for the AAT generally to declare that the therapeutic treatment is unreasonable only if Comcare establishes that there is alternative treatment with equivalent therapeutic benefit available at a lower cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">There may be circumstances where treatment is unreasonable because its anticipated therapeutic benefit does not justify the expense involved in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Section 16(1) of the SRC Act does not indicate that a proposed treatment is reasonable unless alternative treatment of more or less equivalent therapeutic benefit and at a lesser cost is shown by Comcare to be available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That is consistent with the approach of Stone J in Rope [2004] FCA 540 ; 135 FCR 443.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Of course, it will be common for the reasonableness of proposed medical treatment to be assessed in the light of alternative treatment options, but that is not necessarily so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There might be cases where the cost of the proposed treatment, even if no other treatment options were available, would lead to the view that the proposed treatment is unreasonable having regard to its anticipated benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Such a circumstance is, of course, likely to be uncommon if only because treating medical practitioners generally act responsibly and with sound medical judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">26 It is plain enough that sometimes proposed therapeutic treatment will be unreasonable because there is some alternative treatment available with potentially similar benefits at a lesser cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">There may be a balancing involved where the potential therapeutic benefits are less, but the cost is significantly less.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent to which such treatment has been undertaken in the past and the degree of its success may also be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">There may be cases, as Comcare points out, where proposed treatment, although of therapeutic benefit, is unreasonable having regard to the extent of the anticipated benefit of the cost involved, even if no similar treatment had previously been undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">There may be cases, also as Comcare points out, where treatment like the proposed treatment which in the past has had some therapeutic benefit may no longer be reasonable because the extent of the therapeutic benefit no longer justifies the cost in the light of past experience: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Bashar v Comcare (2002) 69 ALD 784.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There may be other illustrations of facts relevant to the determination of reasonableness of proposed medical treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">27 However, in my view, the remarks of the AAT complained of must be seen in the context of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The context of the case, as explained above in [12] is that Comcare claimed that the treatment was not reasonable in the circumstances for two specific reasons, namely the availability of alternative treatment with potentially similar therapeutic benefits and at a much lesser cost either at home, or otherwise in Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">That was the primary case which the AAT was called upon to address and it did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In my view its comments in the passage of concern to Comcare must be read in that context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">If they were to be read as supporting the general proposition set out at the concluding part of its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I would agree that the AAT had fallen into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">28 In my judgment, the AAT also did not fall into error in the manner asserted in the second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The AAT referred to the fact that Comcare had previously funded the retreat or a similar retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It did not suggest that, for that reason, any further retreats are necessarily to be regarded as reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It would have been erroneous to have taken that step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It referred to those facts simply to record that, in the past, there had been therapeutic benefit experienced from such retreats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">If there had not been, the case for the retreat being reasonable would have been much weaker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In my view, where proposed treatment is the same or similar to that previously performed, the extent to which the previous treatment had generated therapeutic benefit is relevant to determining the reasonableness of the proposed further treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">I think that is all that the Tribunal did when it referred to Comcare having previously funded similar retreats, namely to take account of the fact of previous similar retreats and the extent to which in the past such retreats had produced therapeutic benefit: see generally Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">29 The observation that Comcare had not demonstrated an alternative medical treatment with equivalent therapeutic benefit but at a lower cost was one to be seen in the context of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In this case, the Tribunal rejected the first of Comcare's two propositions (set out at [12] above) because it was not satisfied that the alternative of "home retreat" would produce therapeutic benefits similar to those of the retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It did so in addressing Comcare's assertion that, in the circumstances and on the evidence, there was such alternative treatment available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The AAT was obliged to make a finding upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It rejected the contention because there was no cogent evidence to support it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The Tribunal did not err in concluding that, on the evidence, the alternative of a retreat conducted by the Northern Territory Buddhist Society in Alice Springs was not an available reasonable alternative treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It was true to its role as a substitute arbiter of the facts for the primary decision-maker upon the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">30 As a matter of commonsense, if Comcare wished the AAT to find that the Northern Territory Buddhist Society would probably offer a retreat with similar benefits in Alice Springs, more evidence in support of that assertion was desirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In a practical sense, in the particular circumstances, such evidence would have been adduced by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">That is not to impose any onus of proof upon Comcare: cf McDonald v Director-General of Social Security (1984) 1 FCR 354; Comcare v Nichols [1999] FCA 209 at [18] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Holt sought to have a proposed medical treatment paid by Comcare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">He was entitled to payment if the treatment was reasonable in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">He had the support of his general practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In the normal course, that would be sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Merely because Comcare referred to the Northern Territory Buddhist Society website, Mr Holt did not have to prove that the Society provided an alternative treatment option available to him of probable equivalent therapeutic benefit and at a lower cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">A moment's pause fortifies that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Were it otherwise, every time an injured person sought medical treatment, that person would otherwise have to positively adduce evidence that the treatment could not be provided at a cheaper price by some other medical practitioner, or that no other treatment of equivalent therapeutic value would be available at a lesser price through another medical practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The AAT, in my view, correctly decided the reasonableness of the retreat on the evidence and in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">31 It is correct that the AAT, having rejected Comcare's two identified contentions for why the proposed treatment was not reasonable, does not appear then to have further considered whether the retreat was unreasonable simply because its potential therapeutic benefit did not justify its cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">32 The Statement of Facts and Contentions submitted to the AAT on 9 March 2006, well before the hearing of the AAT on 20 November 2006, included the claim that the retreat is unreasonable because:
 
 &#8226; Any benefit Mr Holt may obtain by attending the retreat is outweighed by its cost (the cost was identified at about $1650);
 &#8226; There are other forms of meditation instruction available in Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">

33 However, the AAT is entitled to decide a review application on the issues identified in the course of the hearing and final submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Not every issue raised at an early stage of its proceedings survives as an issue for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The present application provides an illustration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Initially, Mr Holt first had to overcome Comcare's decision that the retreat did not constitute "therapeutic treatment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">As noted, at the hearing Comcare by counsel indicated that that was no longer an issue, and that it was only the reasonableness or otherwise of the retreat as therapeutic treatment which needed to be decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">34 Counsel for Comcare at the start of the AAT hearing, when indicating the remaining issue was that of the reasonableness of the retreat, referred to its Contentions as identifying "three points in respect of reasonableness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">One issue as to reasonableness raised in the Contentions of 9 March 2006 concerned an apparently different medical opinion to that of Dr Zerk about the potential therapeutic benefits of the retreat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That, too, was not pursued before the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">35 In closing submissions, counsel for Comcare said:
 
 It's our submission that this is not reasonable, given the cost involved and the fact that it can be replicated in his own home where he has a supportive partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">These are the reasons why we say it's not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He has a supportive partner who understands the requirements of meditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He has a room that he can set aside for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">He is very experienced and knowledgeable as to what is required for the purposes of meditation, having done it for some 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">We say, looking at the cost, the fact that he can reproduce it himself here and the fact that the benefits are short-lived, that it's not reasonable medical treatment, particularly given that the sessions, for example, held in the Chenrezig Institute ... show these are individual retreats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">

and later (after brief submissions concerning the Northern Territory Buddhist Society) counsel for Comcare said:
 
 Our main argument is that it is not reasonable to pay yet again --- this will be something like the sixth time that Comcare has paid for a meditation retreat ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It's not reasonable, given that Comcare has already paid for a number, the high cost involved, and when Mr Holt has the expertise himself to set up a similar treatment process within his own home, by accessing advice if he needs it by some other means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That's our argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">

It was in that context that counsel for Comcare, in answer to the AAT, said that it is appropriate to take into account that Mr Holt had undertaken several similar retreats before and in that light " ... to look at the benefit and whether the cost is warranted given the benefit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">36 Counsel for Comcare then identified the alternative argument that Mr Holt, having been made aware of the Northern Territory Buddhist Society website, should have pursued the possibility of it providing a like retreat in Alice Springs, and that his failure to have done so meant that the AAT should find that the retreat was not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">37 In my judgment, the AAT is not shown to have erred in law by misunderstanding the extent of Comcare's submission about reasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Its Contentions of 9 March 2006 must be read in the light of their exposition in final submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The final submissions indicate that the issue of whether the retreat was reasonable was not put on the discrete basis that, putting other treatment options aside, the point had been reached where no longer was it warranted on a cost/benefit analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It was put that it was no longer reasonable having regard to the past history of the benefits of such treatment, the cost, and the availability in particular of the home retreat option with external support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The AAT so understood that contention, and it addressed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It did not err in law in not addressing a contention that the retreat was not reasonable, having regard only to its cost and the past benefit of such retreats, because ultimately Comcare's contention was not put in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">38 That, of course, does not preclude Comcare from making a decision on that basis in the future if, again, Mr Holt seeks further such treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In my view, however, the AAT did not err in failing to address a contention seriously advanced by Comcare, founding its third ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">39 For those reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">40 I am grateful to counsel for their assistance, in particular counsel for Mr Holt who appeared pro bono on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.</sentence>
