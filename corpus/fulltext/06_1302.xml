 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 I have before me the further hearing of the trial of the action in relation to a number of specific matters consequent upon the publication of Reasons for Judgment on 30 June 2006 in proceedings commenced by the Employment Advocate for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') pursuant to which a declaration was sought that each of the four respondents engaged in contraventions of s 298K of the Act in two respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">First, in August and September 2002, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents terminated the employment of 12 individuals employed at the South Grafton Abattoir for a prohibited reason or reasons that included a prohibited reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Secondly, that each of the four respondents between mid September 2002 and December 2002 then refused to employ any one of 11 of those individuals, again for prohibited reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Apart from a declaration of a contravention of s 298K of the Act, the Employment Advocate sought an order imposing on each respondent a penalty pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act, an order pursuant to s 298U(c) of the Act requiring the respondents to pay the 12 individuals compensation for the affect upon each of them of the contravening conduct and an order in reliance upon s 356(b) of the Act that any penalty imposed upon the respondents be paid to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Section 298T(2)(d) of Div.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">6 of Pt XA of the Act provides that the Employment Advocate may apply to the Federal Court of Australia for orders under s 298U concerning conduct in contravention of Pt XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 On 30 June 2006, I published Reasons for Judgment and adjourned the matter to a date to be fixed to enable the Applicant to formulate short minutes of order reflecting the declarations to be made arising out of the findings contained in the reasons and to hear the parties in relation to further submissions concerning the principles governing the assessment of a compensation component described as general damages in the Applicant's Further Further Amended Statement of Claim, the principles governing whether, and if so, the basis upon which a penalty pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act ought to be imposed, further submissions concerning the position in relation to Mr Blackadder and submissions concerning the principles guiding the circumstances in which an order might be made under s 356 of the Act that any penalty imposed upon any one or more of the Respondents be paid to the Employment Advocate ( McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 No final orders have been made in the matter consequent upon the published Reasons for Judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 On 3 August 2006, the matter was further reviewed and these directions were made ( McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3) : [2006] FCA 994): 
 
 
 '(a) the Respondents shall file in the court and serve upon the Applicant any further affidavit material upon which any of them intend to rely in relation to the determination of the question of whether a penalty ought to be imposed upon any of them pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) by 4.00pm, Thursday, 17 August 2006; 
 
 (b) the Applicant shall file affidavits in reply (if any) by Thursday, 24 September 2006; and 
 
 (c) the matter will be re-listed for the hearing of further submissions at 10.15am on Monday, 28 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">' 
 
 
 
 
 7 I had previously made directions that the Applicant and the Respondents file and serve written submissions in relation to the principles guiding the assessment of compensation for the purposes of the Act and the principles informing whether, and if so the basis upon which, a penalty pursuant to s 298U ought to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On Friday, 1 September 2006, the further hearing of these matters took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 On 14 August 2006, the Applicant filed a notice of motion returnable 1 September 2006 by which the Applicant sought to further amend the application so as to seek an order pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act that any monetary penalty imposed upon any of the Respondents be paid to the individuals rather than the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Applicant has filed and served written submissions in support of the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Respondents object to the proposed amendment as it has been raised very late in the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">However, the Respondents are not able to point to any prejudice to the Respondents as any penalty that might be imposed upon any one or more of the Respondents would either be paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth or the Employment Advocate or as might otherwise be ordered consistent with principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">9 I will give leave to amend the application in terms of the Further Further Further Further Amended Application marked Attachment 'A' to the Notice of Motion filed 14 August 2006 which reflects an amended order 5 sought by the application in these terms: 
 
 
 '5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">An order under s356(b) of the Act that any penalty imposed on the respondents be paid to the persons named in paragraph 1 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 
 
 
 The Affidavit of Stuart Bruce Ramsey 
 
 10 On 14 August 2006, the Respondents filed evidence upon which they proposed to rely in relation to the further matters to be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The evidence consists of an affidavit sworn 10 August 2006 by Mr Stuart Bruce Ramsey, the Managing Director of each of the four respondent companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The affidavit is in these terms: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I am the Managing Director of each Respondent Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">With the assistance of various staff members I manage the business of the Respondent Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">On 3 August 2006, Justice Greenwood dismissed a notice of motion made on behalf of my companies seeking a stay of any further hearing of the proceeding being Federal Court proceedings QUD66 of 2003 and ordered the Respondents' file and serve further affidavit material upon which they intend to rely in relation to the determination of the question of whether a penalty ought to be imposed upon any of my Respondents Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Annexed hereto and marked "SBR-1" are copies of draft accounts for 30 June 2006 for each of the Respondent Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Three of the companies are labour hire companies, with the execution of Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd which ceased to be an employer at South Grafton Abattoir on or about 3 September 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">All four (4) Respondent Companies own no assets of any significance and their sole income is a labour hire fee which is expended for the provision of that labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The wholesale beef industry is in troubled times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Markets are hard to service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Appropriate cattle are not available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The South Grafton Abattoir as a total enterprise is losing thousands of dollars per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It may shut shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I expect more abattoirs to close soon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Over the last ten (10) years the number of abattoirs has decreased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There are very few abattoirs now in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">At the time of the stock shortage I obtained legal advice from my solicitor, Junior Counsel and Senior Counsel as to the appropriate method of arranging staff stand downs when closing the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Likewise when reopening the plant I again sought advice and acted on that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">' 
 
 
 
 
 11 Those six paragraphs represent the totality of the evidence put before the court in relation to these additional matters by the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The attachment to the affidavit comprises the financial report (that is financial accounts) to 30 June 2006 for Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd, Ramsey Food Packaging No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">2 Pty Limited, Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Limited and Ramsey Food Services Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">12 The Applicant objects to aspects of Mr Ramsey's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">As to the first three sentences at paragraph 4, the Applicant contends that these sentences are simply expressions of opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In addition, they are said to be 'so vague as to be useless in any consideration of the issues' now before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Even if the subject matter of each sentence is sufficiently specific and is shown to rest upon a foundation of fact giving rise to the conclusions, the matters are said, in any event, to be irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Further, the only matters in paragraph 4 that are said to be relevant are the matters going to the circumstances of the South Grafton Abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">13 As to paragraph 5, the Applicant objects to the whole of it although it simply comprises three sentences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The basis for the objection is said to be that the matters are expressions of opinion as to what might happen in relation to other abattoirs, a statement that the number of abattoirs has decreased and an observation that there are very few abattoirs now in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">All of these matters are said to be vague and irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">14 As to paragraph 6, Mr Ramsey says that he relied upon legal advice from not only his solicitor but also Junior Counsel and Senior Counsel as to the appropriate method of arranging stand downs when closing the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Further, Mr Ramsey says that when reopening the plant, he again sought advice presumably from each of the three previously nominated advisers and acted on that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Applicant objects to paragraph 6 on the grounds that the statements are hearsay; the deponent has sought to suggest inferentially the advice he was given consistent with things he actually did; and the affidavit fails to disclose the advice itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Accordingly, neither the Applicant nor the court, it is said, is in a position to make an informed assessment of the scope of the advice, its materiality to particular conduct by Mr Ramsey on behalf of the Respondents or the extent to which Mr Ramsey relied upon the advice or parts of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Mr Ramsey has elected not to waive privilege in relation to the advice, nor attach a copy of any written advice to his affidavit, nor depose to the central and critical matters which provided the foundation for his election to act in any particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">15 In response to these matters, counsel for the Respondents says that as to paragraph 4, the assertions made by Mr Ramsey are simply a fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The sentences depose to Mr Ramsey's state of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In any event, if the statements represent a matter of opinion, Mr Ramsey is qualified to give that opinion as he is the Managing Director of each respondent company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Further, paragraphs 4 and 5 are said to be relevant to the financial impact upon the Respondents of a penalty and the matter of public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The public interest is said to be reflected in the community interest in securing enduring employment at the South Grafton Abattoir particularly having regard to the historical circumstances surrounding the industrial arrangements which were put in place to enable the South Grafton Abattoir to recommence under Mr Ramsey's governance after the closure of the abattoir under the administration of R J Gilbertson Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Accordingly, counsel for the Respondents says that I should have regard to the financial circumstances confronting the Respondents based upon the evidence of the accounts and consider the public interest in future employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Counsel also says that the three sentences making up paragraph 5 provide contextual relevance concerning the circumstances in which the South Grafton Abattoir operates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 As to paragraph 6, counsel says that the evidence that Mr Ramsey sought advice from his lawyers, obtained advice and acted upon it is relevant to Mr Ramsey's state of mind when considering the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Counsel observes that it is simply a fact that needs to be taken into account in weighing where the balance lies in assessing a possible penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">17 I will admit the entirety of the affidavit into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The evidence is largely unhelpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Paragraph 4 comprises four short conclusionary sentences or statements of prevailing circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">There are no foundation facts supporting the statements and no attempt has been made to describe the environment within which the Respondents operate either in a direct sense or contextually so as to provide the court with a matrix of fact concerning the circumstances confronting the operational activity of each company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Ramsey as Managing Director of each of the four Respondents must be in a position to express an informed assessment of that environment and those circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">18 Similarly, paragraph 5 simply comprises three sentences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">19 As to paragraph 6, I propose to have regard to the fact that Mr Ramsey took legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">However, the brevity with which the matter is expressed does not place me in a position where I can weigh that fact in any meaningful way as I have no sense of the materiality of the advice, the scope of the advice or the extent to which Mr Ramsey relied upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In order to be helpful and properly serve the interests of the Respondents, the deponent would need to disclose the advice so as to give the point Mr Ramsey seeks to make by force of paragraph 6, some real coherence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 BACKGROUND MATTERS 
 
 20 On 30 June 2006, I published Reasons for Judgment ('the reasons') in relation to the matters dealt with in the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I do not propose to repeat the detail of those reasons in the course of these considerations although it will be necessary to identify some aspects of the findings and the contextual events in these reasons arising out of the further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">These reasons are to be read in conjunction with the earlier reasons of 30 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">21 The material matters are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">22 In August and September 2002 the First, Third and Fourth Respondents were the employers of the 12 individuals (among others) identified at [2] and [114] of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Those paragraphs identify the particular bilateral employment relationship between each individual and the relevant Respondent employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The individuals are Brooks, Campbell, Susan Young, Swain, Blackadder, Delaforce, Forrest, Hambly, Michael McKenzie, Paul McKenzie, Moss and John Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">23 Each individual was employed in a particular capacity undertaking work at the South Grafton Abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The position each individual held is identified at [114] of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The history of the working engagement of each individual at the South Grafton Abattoir is described at [115].</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The South Grafton Abattoir had for many years been owned and operated by R J Gilbertson Pty Ltd ('Gilbertson').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The abattoir had closed in December 1997 with Gilbertson asserting failing profitability and substantial accumulated losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In approximately April 1998, the abattoir reopened under the new ownership and operational governance of Mr Stuart Ramsey acting on behalf of entities including the First Respondent, the Third Respondent and the Fourth Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">24 The immediate events of termination involve these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">On Monday, 19 August 2002, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('AIRC') made an order which had the effect of terminating a range of Australian Workplace Agreements ('AWAs') with effect from 23 September 2002 including AWAs signed by Blackadder, Brooks, Campbell, Delaforce, Forrest, Hambly, Michael McKenzie, Paul McKenzie, Moss, John Young and Susan Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">25 On Wednesday, 21 August 2002, management of the South Grafton Abattoir placed a notice on the abattoir noticeboard to all employees advising that the plant continued to operate under a stock shortage for the purposes of the AWAs until advised otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">On 29 August 2002, a further notice was placed on the noticeboard referring to the notice of 21 August 2002 and notifying employees that there would not be sufficient stock to kill on Monday, 2 September 2002 and that certain consequences would flow from that event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The notice said that the Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union ('AMIEU') had been advised of the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Also on 29 August 2002, employees were handed a stock shortage notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">26 On 10 September 2002, the individuals received a letter of termination from abattoir management and a further letter of clarification of the position on 13 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The events are described in detail at paragraphs [180] to [187] of the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">27 The act of termination or dismissal had a certain pre-history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">28 Although Stuart Ramsey had conducted discussions with Ms Kathleen Evans, the secretary of the Newcastle and northern branch of the AMIEU, as described at [102] and [103] of the reasons, no agreement had been reached to establish an enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Rather, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents entered into AWAs with their employees at the various functional levels of operation of the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Those functional activities are described at [106] to [111].</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">29 The Employment Advocate referred each of the AWAs to the AIRC for an approval hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The AIRC concluded that because the 'tally system' (see [107] of the reasons) adopted by the AWAs was more disadvantageous to employees than the relevant award with a follow through effect upon benefits, the AWAs failed to satisfy the 'no disadvantage test'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">However, having regard to other factors, the AIRC concluded that it was not contrary to the public interest to approve the AWAs coupled with particular undertakings [117] --- [120].</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">30 Each AWA had a nominal term of three years, from, by and large, the end of April 1998 although each AWA would remain in place after the date of nominal expiry until such time as the AWA was replaced or terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">31 On 15 February 2001, Stuart Ramsey convened and addressed a meeting of employees at the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">At that time, many of the employees believed that a new agreement would be in place during April 2001 but no new agreement was to be proposed until October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The delay was attributed to conduct on the part of Mr Davis and the AMIEU [123] - [131].</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">32 On 3 October 2001, Stuart Ramsey proposed a certified agreement with a vote to be taken on 18 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The methodology was to take the prevailing AWAs and adopt certain variations to those instruments as the terms and conditions of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">At a meeting on 3 October 2001 of abattoir workers chaired by Paul McKenzie, a decision was taken to establish a consultative committee to negotiate aspects of the proposal with Mr Ramsey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The members of the committee included Delaforce, Moss and Paul McKenzie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">33 Delaforce was expressing dissatisfaction on a number of grounds with working conditions [136] --- [144].</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">34 On 5 October 2001, Mr Davis on behalf of the AMIEU wrote to Mr Ramsey advising that he proposed to meet with employees and discuss aspects of the proposal [145] --- [149].</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">35 On 16 or 17 October 2001, a second proposal for an enterprise agreement was distributed by the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">A critique of that proposal was prepared by the AMIEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The proposal was to be voted upon by employees on 5 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">36 On 8 November 2001, a third proposal was put forward by the employer entities reflecting a further change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The vote occurred on 26 November 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">37 On 18 January 2002, the AIRC conducted a hearing of an application by the First, Second and Third Respondents and Paul Allen Contracting Services Pty Ltd for certification of an enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The AMIEU sought leave to intervene and oppose the application on a number of grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">On 8 February 2002, Commissioner Bacon published his decision arising out of the application and referred the matter to the Full Bench.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Commissioner Bacon also gave reasons for the intervention ruling in favour of the AMIEU confirming the continuing standing of the AMIEU to represent employee members of the Union in connection with the proposed enterprise agreement [157] --- [162].</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">38 On 15 February 2002, Stuart Ramsey met with representatives of the employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Some committee members said that they considered that they should go back to the award conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Some heated exchanges occurred concerning the impact or effect of award conditions upon the abattoir's operation [164] --- [165].</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Further discussions took place concerning the question of whether the AMIEU would support certification of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">A memorandum of understanding was proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">No agreement was reached and the application for certification was withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">39 In April 2002, a second consultative committee was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The members included Michael McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell and John Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">40 On 11 April 2002, Alick Delaforce received notice from Stuart Ramsey concerning the introduction of a new bonus system and the terms upon which a bonus might be paid [171].</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Alick Delaforce expressed dissatisfaction with the operation of the bonus system as did others [172] --- [174].</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">41 During May, June and July 2002, meetings took place between employees at the abattoir and the AMIEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">On 14 May 2002, Alick Delaforce and Paul McKenzie collected complaint forms from production employees which were lodged with the office of the Employment Advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Alick Delaforce requested assistance from the AMIEU in making an application to the AIRC for termination of the AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The applications were lodged on 30 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">An order was made on 19 August 2002 which had the effect of terminating many of the AWAs effective from 23 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">42 On 19 July 2002, Alick Delaforce participated in a meeting of employees to discuss conditions and establish a third consultative committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">On 22 August 2002, a resolution was passed electing a third consultative committee and on 23 August 2002 notice was given to management by letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The members of the third consultative committee included John Young, Trevor Moss, Paul McKenzie, Gregory Forrest, Terrence Brooks, Alick Delaforce and Susan Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">43 The articulated basis for the dismissal of the employees including the 12 identified individuals the subject of the proceedings was a stock shortage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">44 On 16 September 2002, in light of the events and the termination letters of 10 September 2002 and 13 September 2002 [26] of these reasons, Alick Delaforce, Trevor Moss and Justin Davis sought a meeting with Stuart Ramsey to discuss re-engagement of Union members of the workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Justin Davis told management that all employees were prepared to work and would work if given work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Management said that the abattoir was offering work that day to only those individuals contacted by the abattoir [188].</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">On 17 September 2002, Justin Davis conducted (with Mr Brown) a meeting of workers outside the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">As employees approached the security guards, the names of particular employees seemed to be checked off against a list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Some employees were able to enter, others not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Alick Delaforce asked the gate security guard whether his name was on a list of workers allowed to work that day and was told his name was not on the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Later that day he was told in a telephone call from management that there would be work for him at the abattoir for the following day, 18 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">45 On the evening of Tuesday, 17 September 2002, Alick Delaforce and Trevor Moss conceived a compromise proposal to resolve the re-employment of all employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">A written proposal was given to management [190].</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Stuart Ramsey refused to consider the compromise proposal until all workers rostered for that day, 17 September 2002, returned to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">46 At [195] --- [202] of the reasons, conclusions are reached arising out of findings in relation to the events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">At [203] of the reasons, these observations are made: 
 
 
 '203.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">... Mr Ramsey knew or must be taken to have known that P F McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell, Forrest, M R McKenzie, J K Young and S J Young were members of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Mr Ramsey also knew of the articulated dissatisfaction with conditions identified by Delaforce and Moss and the critique of conditions of employment prepared by the Union and the dissatisfaction expressed with conditions by members of the consultative committees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The first committee included Union members P F McKenzie, Moss and Delaforce; the second, M R McKenzie, Brooks, Campbell and J K Young; and the third, J K Young, S J Young, Moss, Forrest, Brooks, Delaforce and P F McKenzie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Having regard to the chronology of these events and the proximity of the timing between the successful applications for termination of the AWAs and the subsequent publication of the dismissal notices, an inference is open that dissatisfaction with working conditions in the context of the agitation by the AMIEU for better industrial conditions of employment was a reason for the dismissal of Delaforce, P F McKenzie, Moss, Brooks, Campbell, Forrest, M R McKenzie, J K Young and S J Young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The evidence of Mr Forrest at [306] shows that after the dismissals and upon re-engagement of employees (approximately 80 to 90 employees), Mr Ramsey expressed his view of the new environment in this way: 'This is how the place will be run now, no RDOs, one sick day and you will be gone, you will be paid the Federal award until such time as a new agreement is worked out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">There will be no tally system and you will be paid in accordance with the weight per kilo of the box'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The issue of 'tally' calculations and its relationship with the weight of the beast was an issue for the employers from the outset of operations under Mr Ramsey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Further, having regard to the role of the AMIEU and the hostility on the part of Mr Ramsey towards the AMIEU, an inference is open that a workplace free of those Union members who had become closely associated with the Union position, acted as delegates, distributed material at the workplace and participated in consultative committees urging a different view of conditions of employment was a reason for dismissal of those individuals who were members of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Mr Ramsey's notion that the abattoir would have to close and 'the company could not continue' if the AWAs were brought to an end and the award prevailed [164] or that the abattoir 'would not be viable' under such conditions [165] seems not to be so because within days of the abattoir issuing the termination notices of 10 and 13 September 2002 closing the abattoir, the abattoir was operating again by at least 17 September 2002 and, by 20 September 2002, at least 80 to 90 employees were re-engaged.</sentence>

<sentence id="s339">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 50 It is clear that the abattoir had commenced employing workers at least by 17 September 2002 and attempts had been made by a number of workers to secure employment on 19 and 20 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">All of these 11 men had worked for the South Grafton Abattoir during the days of operation by Gilbertson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The relationship had been a long-standing one at least from March or April 1998 [307] in terms of Mr Ramsey's governance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">At [310], the conclusion is reached that: 
 
 
 '310.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">It is true that on 16 September and 17 September 2002 a position had been taken by many of the workers that none of the former employees would return to work until all workers were allowed to work but these actions were part of the immediacy of a response to the dismissal conduct designed, in fact, to secure work for all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">' 
 
 
 
 
 51 At [312], I conclude: 
 
 
 '312.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On 20 September 2002, Mr Forrest says that he heard Mr Ramsey addressing approximately 80 to 90 workers who had been re-engaged by that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Mr Ramsey was explaining the new features of the conditions of employment which would prevail in the post re-engagement environment as compared with the previous conditions [306].</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The evidence of these witnesses gives rise to an inference that in re-employing a cohort of employees to enable the abattoir to resume orthodox operations, a range of jobs or positions falling within the field of task specific activities characterising abattoir operations (see generally [106] --- [115]) were filled, that is, offers made and individuals employed and others not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The Applicant is not in a position to give evidence of which offer was made for what position to which individual on what particular day and the person who was appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">That information lies within the knowledge of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Nevertheless, the abattoir opened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">It functioned and continued to function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The evidence shows that by 20 September 2002, 80 to 90 people at least were re-engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">I infer that all of the positions occupied and the tasks undertaken by the 12 individuals in issue here from which they were dismissed, remained as positions to be filled and were filled, among many other positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">' 
 
 
 
 
 52 In the context of the dismissal conduct and the re-engagement process, the operation of the AWAs is discussed at [318] --- [322].</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">At [323], a conclusion is reached in these terms: 
 
 
 '323.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">An inference is open that Mr Ramsey took steps in response to the order of the AIRC effecting a termination of the AWAs to deal with the consequence of that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Those steps did not involve abandoning processing operations and closing down the abattoir because it was sub-economic but involved steps to place the operations on the footing of a particular cohort of employees on particular preferred terms and conditions and one method was to invoke the stock shortage provisions, close the abattoir, terminate the contracts without severance, re-open, re-employ and re-commence operations in a new environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The evidence of the centrality attached by Mr Ramsey to the preferred conditions and the conjunction of events do suggest as a matter of common experience that the steps taken by Mr Ramsey were designed to effect a reduction in the complement of workers and establish conditions on a footing more acceptable to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The dismissal of all employees remains, nevertheless, a dismissal of each individual employee and the refusal to re-employ the former employees in contention here can fairly be seen, as a matter of inference, as part of a mechanism for effecting an enduring, final and operative dismissal for a reason related to historical dissatisfaction with conditions and Union agitation for perceived better conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">' 
 
 
 
 
 53 At [356] --- [360], the following conclusions are reached: 
 
 
 '356.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In this case, the employer entities dismissed a cohort of employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Some of those employees, from their individual standpoint, contend the dismissal was for a prohibited reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">They say the circumstances that give rise to that apprehension can be seen in the attitude of Mr Ramsey to the AMIEU, his hostility to the participation of the Union in the workplace and the consequences of Union engagement in various processes before the AIRC and the dissatisfaction nine of the 12 individuals were articulating about conditions of employment against the background of the steps taken by the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">As to three of the individuals, their concern lies in the chronology of events arising out of their constructive dismissal and the subsequent treatment of the individuals consequent upon obtaining orders from the AIRC and particularly orders for reinstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">
 
 357.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The dismissal of the entire cohort of employees does not provide an answer to the essential character of the contravening conduct in respect of the particular individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">The legislation provides a mechanism for an employer to demonstrate that the apprehended and thus alleged reasons for the dismissal are misplaced and incorrect by casting an onus upon the respondent to demonstrate otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">
 
 358.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The same position obtains in relation to the conduct of refusing to employ the relevant individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In essence, the respondents say that in the case of each individual, the particular person was not available for employment, did not seek employment and was not denied employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Moreover, before a refusal to employ an individual for a prohibited reason can arise, the individual must demonstrate that a vacancy was available to be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">
 
 359.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">As to these matters, it is clear that the individuals did seek employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Enquiries were made of management staff as to the availability of the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Steps were taken to refuse immediate employment by some, but expressly for the purposes of trying to secure a return to work for all employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Mr Delaforce and Mr Moss formulated a compromise proposal directed to securing the return to work for all employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Some individuals were episodically offered employment on a day, sometimes after the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Enquiries were made of management and in the immediacy of the dispute and enquiries were made at the gate as to those persons who were on the list for employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The evidence demonstrates that jobs were available and vacancies were being filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Subsequent offers, even though episodic, demonstrate that vacancies were there to be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Notwithstanding the lengthy period of employment on the part of the 12 individuals with the South Grafton Abattoir from the commencement of operations by Mr Ramsey and the pre-existing historical connection with the abattoir in the Gilbertson's days, none of these individuals (leaving aside Susan Young) were offered full time employment or any sustained period of casual employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 
 
 
 
 
 360.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">The historical factors which give rise to inferences that the alleged prohibited reasons were a reason for the conduct also give rise to inferences that those reasons were a reason for the refusal to employ the particular individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The proximity of the timing and evolution of the events are sufficiently related that there is a necessary inter-connection between the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">' 
 
 
 
 
 54 At [367], a finding is reached as to the question of whether a refusal to employ another person, in the circumstances of the case, required evidence to be established of a position to be filled before s 298V might have any operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">As to that matter, I concluded: 
 
 
 '367.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">It seems to me, in having regard to the threshold conduct of a refusal to employ another person, required to be established by the Applicant before s 298V has any operation, the phrase logically contemplates the existence of a position to be filled or a position in prospect within the boundaries of reasonable temporal limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Evidence may demonstrate such a position or demonstrate in respect of a particular industry, a systemic process of casual employment or a recurrent demand within a particular industry for full time employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">It seems to me the Applicant would need to adduce some evidence of a vacancy or prospective vacancy and not simply a theoretical possibility of a position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">In the context of this case, the approach adopted by North J does not need to be considered further because the evidence demonstrates that a process of re-engagement was taking place, vacancies existed and were being filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Vacancies continued to become available and, in some cases, resulted in offers, although limited, being made to some of the individuals in contention here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">The circumstances of the efforts made by the individuals and their evidence of vacancies being filled is clear [306].</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Accordingly, s 298V operates and it has not been discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">By paragraph 20 of the Further Amended Defence (Document 143), the First, Second and Fourth Respondents admit that in September, October and November 2002 each of those respondents commenced re-employing labour at the South Grafton Abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">' 
 
 
 
 
 55 At [376], I found that the First, Second and Fourth Respondents had failed to demonstrate that the alleged prohibited reasons were not an operative reason for a refusal to employ any one of the 11 individuals in the proceedings (that is, all claimants apart from Susan Young).</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">As to the differentiation between those Respondents, I made this observation at [377]: 
 
 
 '377.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">I am satisfied that the evidence demonstrates there is no relevant differentiation between the respondents in terms of the dealings between employees and the broad operation of the South Grafton Abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">No doubt, particular entities associated with or related to Mr Ramsey or entities controlled by Mr Ramsey employ particular individuals and equally, there is very likely to be particular administrative or domestic arrangements between those companies in the provision or performance of services and tasks in connection with the operation of the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">However, whatever the content of those internal arrangements might be, an abattoir requires individuals to perform work in order to function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Those individuals might be employed by any one of a number of companies and be supplied or deployed under contractual arrangements with other entities either related to or, in a practical sense, connected with the operator of the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">For all practical purposes, the question is whether the abattoir as a functional operation, required a cohort of individuals in order to perform the various task specific functions and whether steps were put in place during the period of re-engagement to offer employment to individuals, irrespective of the particular recruiting vehicle or entity used for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">The evidence does not establish whether the Third Respondent was seeking to employ any person in the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Accordingly, the conduct of refusing to employ is confined to conduct on the part of the First, Second and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">' 
 
 
 
 
 56 Accordingly, I was satisfied that each of the First, Second and Fourth Respondents engaged in a contravention of s 298K(1)(d) by refusing to employ particular individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">
 THE DECLARATIONS 
 
 57 Having regard to the findings contained in the reasons, I propose to make the following declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">One further observation should be made arising out of the earlier reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">At [378] reference is made to a contravention of s 298K(1) with respect to the dismissal conduct on the part of all four Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">It is clear from the reasons that the discussion of the dismissal issue is in the context of the conduct of those entities that were relevantly employers of the 12 individuals, namely, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>

 COMPENSATION 
 
 58 The contravening conduct on the part of the First, Third and Fourth Respondents of dismissing the 12 employees and contravening conduct on the part of the First, Second and Fourth Respondents in refusing to employ 11 of those individuals during the re-engagement period, bears a very particular character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Part XA of the Act has these objects: 
 
 
 ' 298A As well as the objects set out in section 3, this Part has these objects: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to ensure that employers, employees and independent contractors are free to join industrial associations of their choice or not to join industrial associations; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) to ensure that employers, employees and independent contractors are not discriminated against or victimised because they are, or are not, members or officers of industrial associations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">' 
 
 
 59 The Respondents, although they adopt an approach to the construction of s 298K(1) and s 298L(1) which has not found favour in the reasons [324] --- [358], accept that the notions of discrimination and victimisation reflected in the objects provision, are central to the operation of Pt XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">The legislative expression of the objects of Pt XA in this regard is to be found in the prohibition upon nominated conduct by an employer carried out for a reason falling within the scope of s 298L(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">That statutory approach is the formulation that captures the prohibition upon conduct that discriminates against or victimises an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">It is the conjunction of the conduct carried out for a prohibited reason (potentially among other reasons) that gives the s 298K(1) conduct its discriminatory character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">60 The consequence in this case of conduct of that character is that 12 individuals suffered a fracturing of the employment relationship, lost the right to derive a gross income from the relevant abattoir entity comprised of the components making up that remuneration and 11 of them were refused re-engagement when the re-engagement process commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It seems to me that there is an important point of distinction between the unlawful termination of an employment relationship on the one hand and a dismissal (coupled, in this case, with a refusal to re-employ) for a prohibited purpose contemplated by s 298L on the other hand, which involves a contravention of the statutory formulation for securing the object of prohibiting discrimination against or prohibiting victimisation of an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The circumstances of this case are not simply one of deprivation of employment but rather dismissal and refusal to employ on grounds exhibiting a particular vice the legislature has sought to expressly prohibit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">61 Each of the 11 individuals, the subject of a refusal to employ, took a number of steps to secure work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">They are identified at [379] of the reasons.</sentence>

 Name Economic Loss Superannuation Total Michael Robert McKenzie 
41 weeks @ $498.60 ($20,442.26
Less Earnings:
Centrelink $ 1,590.61
Caringa Enterprises $16,931.00
Earnings from Abattoir $ 94.96 
Total $18,616.47 $1,825.69 $164.31 $1,990.00 
 
 63 The Applicant accepts the submission of the Respondents made at paragraph 21 of their written submissions that the calculation of Stephen Blackadder's claim for economic loss is $3,763.58 with an additional superannuation component of $338.72 rather than the calculation reflected at [380].</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">The submission of the Respondents is made on the assumption of the period of compensation adopted in the reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">64 Accordingly, the economic loss flowing from the contravening conduct to be awarded to each individual is the amount set out at [380] of the reasons adjusted in the case of Stephen Blackadder to the amount set out at [63] herein and the amount in respect of Michael McKenzie is that set out at [62] herein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">65 Apart from the deprivation of earnings consequent upon the dismissal of the 12 employees and the refusal to employ 11 of them, the Applicant contends that each individual is entitled to compensation for the purposes of s 298U(c), (e) and (f) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The Applicant contends that these provisions, properly construed, are sufficiently broad that in a proper case they provide a foundation upon which a sum analogous to general damages might be identified as compensation for the disturbance, disruption, loss of opportunity and loss of secure employment occasioned by the termination of employment in breach of Pt XA of the Act ( Australian Municipal Administrative Clerical Services Union v Greater Dandenong City Council (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">2) [2001] FCA 1076 at [15] per Madgwick J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Such sum ought to be a 'suitable and appropriately modest figure' per Madgwick J at [15].</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">66 Section 298U is, relevantly, in these terms:
 ' 298U In respect of conduct in contravention of this Part, the Court may, if the Court considers it appropriate in all the circumstances of the case, make one or more of the following orders: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (c) an order requiring the person or industrial association to pay to an employee or independent contractor, or to a prospective employee or independent contractor, compensation of such amount as the Court thinks appropriate; 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (e) ...any other orders that the Court thinks necessary to stop the conduct or remedy its effects; 
 
 (f) any other consequential orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">' 
 
 
 
 
 67 The question to be determined as a function of the statutory construct adopted by s 298U of the Act is whether, upon an examination of 'all the circumstances of the case' , it is 'appropriate' to require a person to pay another, 'compensation' , 'in respect of conduct in contravention' of Pt XA, 'of such amount as the Court thinks appropriate '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">68 Analytically, the starting point is to examine the conduct in contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">The second step is to determine those things that have occurred in the lives of the individuals affected by the conduct that bear at least some relation to the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">The third step is to determine whether those things arise in respect of the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">The fourth step is to determine whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances to make an order that the affected individuals be compensated for the relevant events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">If so, the fifth step is to determine 'such amount as the Court thinks appropriate'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">69 In this case, the conduct found in contravention of the Act is the dismissal of 12 individuals by, variously, the First, Third and Fourth Respondents and the refusal to employ 11 of those former employees by the First, Second and Fourth Respondents, in the circumstances reflected in the declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">The conduct of dismissal and refusal to employ is to be viewed as two closely related points on the continuum of conduct effecting an enduring, final and operative dismissal for a prohibited reason as found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">Most of the 12 individuals dismissed by the First, Third and Fourth Respondents had experienced a working relationship with the operator of the abattoir for a considerable period and all of them had been employed from either March or April 1998 under the management of Stuart Ramsey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">70 Upon termination, 11 of the former employees sought to re-establish an employment relationship with the abattoir as the particular Ramsey entities quite rapidly recruited employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Gregory Forrest gave evidence that on 20 September 2002 he presented for work and was allowed to enter the abattoir and observed and heard Stuart Ramsey addressing 80 to 90 workers at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">71 The circumstances confronting these individuals and the steps they took to secure work although reflected at [49] of these reasons bears some further examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Colin Hambly, for example, attended the abattoir gate to seek work on the morning of 17 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">He experienced an exchange with a security guard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Hambly asked whether he would be allowed to enter the abattoir for work according to a list held by the security guard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">The guard made a call and asked, 'Should I admit Colin Hambly?</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">' After the call, the security guard told Hambly, 'You will not be admitted today or any other day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">' On 18, 19 and 20 September 2002, Hambly presented himself at the gate of the abattoir and asked whether he would be allowed to enter the abattoir for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">He was told that he would not be admitted for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Colin Hambly made further enquiries by telephone to seek work at the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">The last enquiry was made on 13 February 2003 of Mr Marshall on behalf of management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Hambly was told that a form would be sent to him by which he might apply for work at the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">No such form was sent to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">72 Similarly, Delaforce attended the gate of the abattoir on 17 September 2002 and asked a security guard whether his name was on a list of workers to be allowed to enter the abattoir for work that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Delaforce was told his name was not on the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">He was told by telephone that work would be available for him the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">On that day, Delaforce placed a proposal before management to try and secure a general resumption of work for all workers not just himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Delaforce did not approach the gate or the security guard on 19 or 20 September 2002 as he was in Sydney before the AIRC in relation to proceedings concerning the termination of the contracts of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">On 28 November 2002 at 4.15pm, Delaforce received a letter from the abattoir dated 26 November 2002 offering him work on 27 November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">On 29 November 2002 at 2.30pm, Delaforce received a letter dated 28 November 2002 offering him work on 29 November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">On 29 November 2002 at 3.20pm, Delaforce attended the abattoir and spoke with Mr Marshall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Delaforce told Marshall that he was available for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">On 2 December 2002, Delaforce sent a letter to Marshall advising that he had accepted casual employment at another enterprise but that he would make himself available for work at the abattoir on Thursdays and Fridays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">On 4 December 2002, Marshall told Delaforce that there would be work for him on the following day on the slaughter floor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Delaforce worked at the abattoir on 5 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">No other offers of work were made to Delaforce by the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">73 In the case of Paul McKenzie, he approached the abattoir gate and made enquiries of the security guard every morning of the week commencing Monday, 16 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">McKenzie presented himself again each day throughout the following week and again the person on the gate told him each time that his name was not on the list for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">McKenzie made telephone calls to Marshall to seek work, without success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">McKenzie then sought work in other places.</sentence>

<sentence id="s609">75 Brooks presented on 17, 18, 19 and 20 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">76 Campbell presented himself to the security guard on 17, 18 and 20 September 2002.</sentence>

<sentence id="s614">McKenzie worked as a boner for one day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">On Monday, 23 September 2002, McKenzie presented for work at the gate and was told his name was not on the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">On the following Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, McKenzie was told the same thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">On Thursday, 26 September 2002, McKenzie told Marshall he would not present himself at the gate any longer to see if his name was on the list but would make a telephone call each morning instead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">McKenzie made a telephone call to the abattoir every day for a week at approximately 6.00am and was told that his name was not on the list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">On 2 December 2002, McKenzie received a letter from the abattoir dated 29 November 2002 which offered him employment 'for tomorrow 29 November 2002'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">79 In the case of John Young, he was offered work on 16 September 2002 for the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">John Young was not willing to work on that day having regard to the workers resolution and the attempt to secure a return to work more broadly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">No work was offered on 18 or 19 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">On 19 September 2002, Young handed a note of a request for the payment of entitlements to the guard at the abattoir gate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">On 20 September 2002, Young was told that he was not on the list for work that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">No offers of employment from the abattoir were put to him after 16 September 2002 and he has not worked at the abattoir since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">80 Accordingly, each of the employees experienced to a greater or lesser degree, a situation of presenting at the gate to be told that the individual's name was not on the list for work.</sentence>

<sentence id="s646">84 The effect of this evidence is that employees who had experienced an association with the abattoir for some time and an employment relationship under the governance of Stuart Ramsey from either March or April 1998 also experienced dismissal from employment in circumstances the subject of the prohibition formulated to give effect to the important objects of Pt XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">The subsequent conduct reflected a degree of symmetry with the dismissal conduct because in respect of 11 of the individuals, the First, Second and Fourth Respondents then refused to employ them during the re-engagement period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">85 Each individual attempted to secure a restoration of the employment relationship and those attempts involved individuals presenting themselves at the gate to a security guard at what was a reasonably long term and familiar workplace, to enquire whether, each day, they would be offered employment that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Sometimes, offers of employment on a particular day were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">Sometimes, offers after the event were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Each employee, subject to the continuing remuneration paid by the abattoir to Blackadder, was compelled to examine other opportunities for employment either on a casual or permanent basis, either within the industry within which that employee had developed skills or in other industries where those skills might not be deployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">86 I accept that the circumstances of the dismissal and the process of re-engagement of employees made it necessary for the 11 individuals to experience a process of presenting themselves at the workplace to determine whether they might that day or on any other day, secure work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">I accept that the conduct of the individual of presenting himself to the process at the gate of the abattoir was something which occurred in respect of the contravening conduct and that it became necessary for each individual to seek out other opportunities for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">I accept that the dismissal conduct and the subsequent process of engagement with the abattoir by the 11 former employees in seeking a restoration of the employment relationship (and thus the experience of the refusal to employ), carried with it disruption and dislocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">The conjunction of the conduct bearing the character given to it by the Act and the events which occurred after the dismissal conduct and throughout the attempts to secure re-engagement, give rise to, in the case of employees who had experienced a long term relationship with the abattoir, particular disruption and dislocation and a loss of secure employment which in all the circumstances renders it appropriate that the affected individuals be compensated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">87 In reaching the conclusion that it is appropriate in the circumstances of the case to order compensation, I recognise that compensation must be confined within reasonable limits and that restraint is required ( Burazin v Blacktown City Guardian Pty Ltd (1996/1997) 142 ALR 144 at 156).</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">In addition, not every termination of employment will attract compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">In Burazin , their Honours Wilcox CJ, Von Doussa and Marshall JJ concluded that in the circumstances of that case, there were 'unusual exacerbating circumstances that make it appropriate to include in the compensation an allowance for distress unnecessarily caused to Mrs Burazin'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 122 at [11] , Marshall J concluded that something more than the usual element of distress which accompanies most terminations must be demonstrated although the notion of 'unusual and exacerbating circumstances' is not necessarily the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">In Aitken v Construction, Mining, Energy, Timberyards, Sawmills and Woodworkers Union of Australia (Western Australian Branch) (1995) 63 IR 1 at 9, Lee J made a number of observations concerning those factors which might inform whether it is 'appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to make an order requiring the employer to pay to the employee compensation of such amount as the court thinks appropriate' in respect of a contravention of the relevant Division of the Industrial Relations Act 1998 (Cth) ('the IR Act') for the purposes of s 170EE of the IR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">That particular legislation also set a cap upon the amount of the compensation that might be ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">As a matter of general principle, Lee J considered that the court would have regard to 'what is reasonable in the circumstances' and would consider 'the detriment occasioned to the employee by the employer's contravention of the Act' and the extent to which 'it is reasonable to compensate the employee for such consequences'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">In some cases, it may be appropriate to include in the measure of compensation a sum 'sufficient to compensate an employee for mental distress or injured feelings caused by a harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Although the statutory context is, of course, a different one, notions of what might be 'reasonable' are relevantly analogous to notions of what is 'appropriate'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">A consideration of a compensable component of mental distress in the context of conduct characterised as an unjust or unreasonable termination of employment suggests such a consideration would be more so relevant in the circumstances of the prohibited purposes identified by the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (s 298L(1)) and the objects the Act seeks to achieve by force of the prohibition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">88 In determining that each employee ought to be paid compensation of $3,000 in the circumstances of the breach by the Greater Dandenong City Council of s 298K of the Act, Madgwick J made reference to Fryar v System Services Pty Ltd (1996) 137 ALR 321 at 330-331 per Von Doussa J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The Respondents say that Fryar's case is not an illustration of the exercise of such a jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">It seems to me that the reference by Madgwick J to Fryar's case was simply intended to recognise that at least in the context of a severance payment which is a form of compensation for the loss of 'non-transferable credits and entitlements built up through length of service such as sick leave, long service leave and for inconvenience and hardship imposed by the termination of employment through no fault of the employee' (Von Doussa J at 331, line 15), the inconvenience and hardship element 'includes the disruption to the employee's routine' and other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">In point of principle, compensation in respect of the contravention of the Act might also take account of disruption and dislocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">89 Having regard to all of these matters, I propose to order compensation of $3,000 in the case of Blackadder as the dislocation and disruption occasioned to him is, it seems to me, less than that occasioned to other employees as Blackadder continued to receive remuneration until 8 December 2002 which presumably ameliorated the immediacy of his sense of dislocation, disruption and distress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">In respect of all other employees, I propose to order compensation of $4,000 in respect of this component of the compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">
 The Amounts 
 
 90 Accordingly, the compensation to be paid in respect of each employee is as follows: 
 Name Amount of Compensation Stephen Bruce Blackadder $7,102.30 Terrence Anthony Brooks $4,000.00 Rodger Charles Campbell $9,624.06 Michael Robert McKenzie $5,990.00 Paul Francis McKenzie $7,761.00 Trevor Glen Moss $4,000.00 Gregory Simon Forrest $8,496.25 Colin James Hambly $21,545.36 Alick James Delaforce $4,228.61 Paul Gerard Swain $19,500.21 John Kevin Young $15,444.39 Susan Jane Young $17,525.52 The Allocation 
 
 91 Since the refusal to employ 11 of the dismissed workers is properly to be seen as an integrated part of the dismissal conduct, the primary conduct attracting compensation ought to be the dismissal conduct by the First, Third, and Fourth Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Accordingly, compensation payable to Brooks, Campbell, Susan Young, and Paul Swain ought to be paid by the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">Compensation payable to Blackadder, Delaforce, Forrest, Hambly, Michael McKenzie, Paul McKenzie, and Moss ought to be paid by the Third Respondent, and compensation in respect of John Young ought to be paid by the Fourth Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">
 PENALTY 
 
 92 The First, Third, and Fourth Respondents have contravened the Act by engaging in the dismissal conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">The First, Second, and Fourth respondents have contravened the Act by engaging in the refusal to employ conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">The two classes of conduct are sufficiently inter-related or symmetrical that in assessing penalty, there are, in effect, 12 contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">At the time of those contraventions, the maximum penalty which the Court might impose in the case of a body corporate was $10,000 for each contravention (s 298U(a)(i)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">In Constructions, Forestry, Mining, and Energy Union v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (1999) 94 IR 231 at [7]-[8], Branson J set out some of the considerations to be taken into account in assessing a penalty in respect of a contravention of Pt XA of the Act, in these terms:
 'The Act gives no explicit guidance to the circumstances in which an order imposing a penalty under s 298U of the Act will be appropriate or as to the circumstances in which a penalty of or near the maximum, or a lesser amount, may be called for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">The Court is simply directed to consider what is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">
 
 The following matters, which are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, seem to me to be considerations to which the Court may appropriately have regard in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and assuming that it does, the amount of the penalty; 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">
 (b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Partt XA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">
 (c) When more than one contravention of Part XA is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct, or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">
 (d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of Part XA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">
 (e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of the association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">
 
 
 
 (f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">' 


 
 93 In Finance Sector Union v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 Merkel J at [24] observed that the above comments of her Honour have been cited and applied in relation to penalties under s 298U and other sections of the Act on many occasions ( Australian Workers Union v Johnson Matthey (Aust) Inc [2000] FCA 728 ; Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers (2000) 99 IR 376 at 377 [5]; Automotive, Food, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v DMG Industries Pty Ltd (2000) 102 IR 175 at 179---180 [10]; Australian Nursing Federation &amp; Ors v Alcheringa Hostel Inc [2004] FCA 375 ; (2004) 136 FCR 530 at 543-544 [44] ; and Alfred v Walter Construction Group Ltd [2005] FCA 497 at [10] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">94 Having regard to the character and content of the contraventions, it cannot be contended that the contraventions are merely technical or trivial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Having regard to the findings contained in the reasons, and the findings extracted from the reasons and incorporated in these reasons, the conduct on the part of each of the respondents, as found, is serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">The maximum penalty which might be ordered constitutes $120,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">The circumstances in which the conduct took place and the consequences of the conduct have been already described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">It should be recognised that the conduct strikes at the freedoms Pt XA seeks to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">No evidence has been filed by the respondents other than the affidavit of Stuart Ramsey so as to raise any matters which might be taken into account in mitigation of a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">There is no evidence of any previous contravention on the part of any of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">At paragraph [41] and [42] of Finance Sector Union v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (supra) Merkel J made these observations:
 '41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">However, the factor of greatest significance in relation to penalty in the present case is the need to impose a penalty which will constitute a general deterrent to others who may be disposed to engage in prescribed conduct of a similar kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">In Leahy at [23] I cited the observations of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd [2001] ATPR 41-815 to the effect that, for a penalty to have the desired effect, it must be imposed at a meaningful level and therefore must be such that a potentially offending corporation will see the penalty as not worth the prospect of gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">
 
 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">The WR Act strikes a balance between employers and their organisations on the one hand, and employees and their organisations on the other hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Irrespective of whether the legislative pendulum has moved, or it is moving, away from or towards, enterprise bargaining agreements or individual contracts, the one legislative constant has been the protection conferred by the freedom of association provisions, or their statutory predecessors in Part XA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">' 
 
 95 At [72], Merkel J said this:
 'It may be that breaches by unions and employers of industrial legislation from time to time have been accepted as part of the give and take of industrial disputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">However, in recent years, industrial legislation has increasingly codified and prescribed what is acceptable, and what is unacceptable, industrial conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">The legislature has, over time, also moved to increase the penalties that may be imposed in respect of unlawful industrial conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">In my view, any light-handed approach that might have been taken in the past to serious, wilful and ongoing breaches of the industrial laws should no longer be applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">
 
 96 The reference by Merkel J to Leahy at [41] of the reasons in Finance Sector Union v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia , is a reference to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) (2005) 215 ALR 281.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">In that case, the Court recognised the application of the ' totality principle ' in assessing penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">Rather than determine a separate penalty in respect of each contravention, it is appropriate to determine a total penalty concerning the course of conduct which has given rise to the field of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">The total penalty ought not to exceed what in the aggregate is appropriate for the entire course of contravening conduct ( Finance Sector Union v The Commonwealth Bank of Australia at [25] per Merkel J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">97 Stuart Ramsey contends that the South Grafton Abattoir as a ' total enterprise ' is losing thousands of dollars per week and may shut shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Contextually, he says that these circumstances are consistent with a wholesale beef industry that is in troubled times and where markets are hard to service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">Mr Ramsey has an expectation that abattoir closures will continue to occur as they have in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">The financial accounts show that Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd has incurred accumulated losses for the financial year ending 30 June 2006 of $55,254 in addition to accumulated losses for the 2005 financial year of $40, 975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Ramsey Food Packaging No 2 Pty Limited has incurred accumulated losses in the financial year ending 30 June 2006 of $123,640 in addition to accumulated losses incurred in the 2005 financial year of $177,456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Similarly, Ramsey Food Services Pty Limited has incurred accumulated losses of $46,824 and $50,461 for the financial years ending 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">The financial accounts for Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Limited do not include a profit and loss statement for the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">The submission put to the Court by the respondents is that the Court should have regard to the prevailing financial circumstances affecting the nominated respondents, the risk of closure of the abattoir, and the abattoir's role in providing continuing employment with the result that the public interest is said to be served by imposing a penalty which might reflect both a deterrent upon conduct but which importantly is also facilitative in recognising the need for the continued operation of the abattoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">98 These submissions might have been able to be developed in a meaningful and coherent way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">However, the material is so brief and limited, it is difficult to usefully deal with the submission or the facts relied upon in support of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">By itself, the financial circumstances of the respondents cannot significantly mitigate the penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">However, those circumstances, taken together with other considerations might usefully inform what is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">Unfortunately, there simply is no sufficient factual foundation for a proper consideration of what is said to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">99 The same vice attends the submissions based upon the extent to which Mr Ramsey took legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">I propose to have regard to that fact as a fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">However, as I indicated at [19] the brevity with which the matter was expressed provides no real sense of the materiality of the advice, the scope of the advice, or the extent to which Mr Ramsey relied upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">100 Having regard to all these factors, I propose to discount the total maximum penalty of $120,000 by 30 per cent, thus resulting in a total penalty of $84,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">101 As to the apportionment of that penalty, I accept the submission of the Applicant that there are notionally six corporations involved in the contravening conduct; three involved in the dismissal conduct; and three involved in the refusal to employ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Each corporation ought to bear one-sixth of the total penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">Since the first and fourth respondents are participants in both classes of conduct, those corporations ought to bear two-sixths (that is one-third) each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">The Second and Third Respondents should bear one-sixth each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">In that event, the First Respondent would bear $28,000 as would the fourth respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">The Second and Third Respondents would each bear $14,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">SECTION 356(b) 
 102 The Applicant seeks an order that the penalty be paid to those affected by the conduct (that is, the twelve individuals).</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">This approach is said to be consistent with what is sometimes described as the ' usual order ' in the sense that it is not uncommon for an order to be made pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act in favour of an Applicant union as the ' person or organisation applying for the penalty to enforce the award for the benefit of the union and it's members ' ( Gibbs v City of Altona (1988) 42 IR 255 at 262 per Gray J; Employees Federation of Australia v General Motors Holden Pty Ltd (1977) 32 FLR 100 at 111 - 114), or on the basis that ' an order that the penalty be paid to the applicant [union] will tend to encourage the enforcement of awards ' ( Electrical Trade Union of Australia v Sims Products Ltd C/A Bifco Batte r ies (1988) 42 IR 250; per Gray J; and Australian Federation of Air Pilots v Skywest Airlines Pty Ltd (1996) 70 IR 284 at 286 --- 287 per Marshall J), or because the contravening conduct affects ' the legitimate interests of the applicant and it's members ' ( CFMEU v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231 at 233 --- 234 per Branson J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">103 The qualification upon the exercise of the power is that such an order ought not to be made if it will result in a windfall gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">Such a windfall might arise in circumstances where the party receiving the benefit of the order has already received compensation pursuant to s 298U both as to any economic loss in respect of the contravention and any non-economic loss in the nature of general damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">104 In Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industry Union v DMG Industries Pty Ltd (1999) 89 IR 360 , the respondent undertook to pay the injured worker his lost wages and undertook to pay the Applicant union's legal costs in a fixed amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">The Applicant union also sought an order that any penalty imposed upon the respondent be paid, consistent with the usual order, to the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Marshall J made an order that monies be paid to the affected individuals (two employees) rather than the union since its costs would be met in reliance upon the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Nevertheless, the authority is cited as authority for the proposition that individuals affected by the conduct ought properly have the benefit of an order even in circumstances where an undertaking has been offered to pay lost wages, (that is, a degree of restitution has occurred).</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">105 The present difficulty is said to be this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">106 The Employment Advocate is a statutory office established by s 150 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">However, the holder of the office has no legal personality independent of the Commonwealth of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">An order for the payment of the penalty to the Employment Advocate is therefore an order for the payment of the penalty to the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">The next level of the problem is said to be that the Employment Advocate and staff are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (Cth) ('the FMA Act ') and the Constitution so far as the receipting and expenditure of public money is concerned (ss 81 and 83 of the Constitution ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">Money received (by order or otherwise) by the Employment Advocate and staff form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund referred to in s 81 of the Constitution and can only be drawn from the Fund under an appropriation consistent with the arrangements set out in the FMA Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">
 107 As a result, any money that the Employment Advocate would wish to pay to the twelve individuals could only be made through an ' act of grace ' payment pursuant to s 33 of the FMA Act out of monies appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">The Employment Advocate has developed a policy of paying penalties obtained as Applicant to those parties directly affected by the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">However, securing an act of grace payment consistent with a parliamentary appropriation is perceived by the Applicant to be a difficult and cumbersome process and accordingly the Court is requested to make an order that the penalties be paid directly to the twelve affected individuals consistent with s 356(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">108 The difficulty with the submission is that the imposition of a penalty under the Act is designed fundamentally to serve the public interest in acting as a deterrent to the particular Respondents and others generally from engaging in conduct of the kind the subject of the findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">In circumstances where an order has been made for compensation for both economic loss and a non-economic component concerning the disturbance, dislocation and loss of secure employment suffered by the individuals, there seems to be no good policy reason why the individuals should additionally have the benefit of an order for the payment to them of the penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">The contravening conduct of dismissal is a repudiation of employment compounded by the refusal to employ 11 of the dismissed employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">The loss flowing from that conduct is the subject of the compensation order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">As an exercise of the power pursuant to s 356(b), I will make an order that the penalty imposed pursuant to s 298U of the Act be paid to the Employment Advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">In making these observations I do not seek to express any view as to the merits or otherwise of an act of grace payment consistent with requirements of the FMA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">

 STATUTORY ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 109 Part XA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) in the form enacted at the date of commencement of these proceedings (comprising ss 298A to 298Z) was repealed by item 193 of Schedule 1 to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) (' Work Choices Act' ) which introduced into the Act a new Pt XA ' Freedom of Association ' comprising eleven Divisions including a new Division 4 entitled ' Conduct of employers '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">Schedule 5 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) had the additional effect of renumbering the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">For example, the renumbered provision conferring power on the Federal Court to award penalties in relation to contraventions of the Freedom of Association provisions, is s 807.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">However, the effect of Regulation 4.53 of the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006 (Cth) taken in conjunction with the definition of the relevant terms in the legislation including the terms 'pre-reform Act' and 'Reform Commencement' is that despite the repeal of Pt XA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) by the Work Choices Act, an application made to the Federal Court under s 298T prior to 27 March 2006 'continues and is to be determined under section 298U' of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as if the Act has not been amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Accordingly, the source of the power to order a penalty or order compensation to be paid is s 298U of Pt XA as that Part stood immediately prior to the 'Work Choices Act' amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">110 As to the power conferred by s 356 of the Act (which is not a provision of Pt XA but Pt XIII) that section was amended by s 495 of the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (Cth) so as to delete a reference to the term 'Consolidated Revenue Fund' in subparagraph (a) and substitute a reference to the term 'the Commonwealth'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">Item 213 of Schedule 1 to the Work Choices Act further amended s 356 to omit the term 'monetary penalty' and substitute the term 'pecuniary penalty'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">The corresponding renumbered provision of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (as amended) now provides in s 841: 
 'A Court that imposes a pecuniary penalty under this Act (other than a penalty for an offence) may order that the penalty, or a part of the penalty, be paid: 
 (a) The Commonwealth; or 
 (b) To a particular organisation or person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">' 
 
 111 In any event, it seems to me the power to order payment of the penalty or a part of the penalty to a particular organisation or person continues to arise by force of the definition of the terms, 'Act', 'pre-reform Act', and 'Work Choices Act', under s 356 for the purposes of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">112 As indicated, I propose to make an order that the pecuniary penalty be paid to the Employment Advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">
