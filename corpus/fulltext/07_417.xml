 The nature of the proceedings 
 
1 The rules of the Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union ('the Union') contain a rule designated as r 5.5, which provides (subject to exceptions not relevant to these proceedings) that:
 
 'no member shall be entitled to nominate in any election for more than one position which would entitle the successful candidate to sit on the National Conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">' 
 

2 Elections for a large number of offices in the Union are in the process of being conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Several candidates have lodged nominations for more than one office, each of which would entitle the successful candidate to sit on the Union's National Conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The returning officers have accepted the nomination of each of those candidates that was lodged first in time and have rejected the later nomination (or, in one case, nominations) of each of those candidates on the basis that they are invalid, because of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The returning officers did not treat the nominations as being defective, and did not give each of the candidates concerned a seven-day period in which to remedy the defects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In addition, some of the candidates sent to the returning officers withdrawals of one or more of their nominations, in an effort to validate their preferred nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">When they made their decision that the first nominations in time should prevail, the returning officers refused to accept the withdrawals of the first in time nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">These reasons for judgment concern the issues arising from the conduct of the elections in this manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The facts 
 
3 The Union is an organisation of employees, registered pursuant to the statutory provisions now found in Sch 1 to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In accordance with those provisions, its elections are being conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An officer of that Commission, Brian Peisley, who is based in Sydney, is the returning officer for the elections for the Union's national offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Michael Pryor, another officer of the Australian Electoral Commission, based in Melbourne, is the returning officer for the elections for the offices in the Victorian Branch of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Because of the timetable of the elections and the need to coordinate elections in various State branches with the elections for national officers, it has been necessary to conduct these proceedings, and to resolve them, with some expedition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I gave orders on Friday, 16 March 2007, to enable ballot papers to be printed, but reserved my reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">These reasons for judgment are the reasons for which I made those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 Before the Court are three applications for inquiries into some of the elections, instituted pursuant to s 200 of Sch 1 to the WR Act by three members of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicant in proceeding no VID 173 of 2007 is James Main Reid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Reid's nomination for the office of State Secretary, Victoria was received by Mr Pryor at 3.00 pm on 31 January 2007, and his nomination for National Secretary was received by Mr Peisley at 3.45 pm on 31 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Reid's application is for an inquiry into the elections for the offices of State Secretary, Victoria and National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The applicant in proceeding no VID 174 of 2007 is Paul Wisniewski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Wisniewski was nominated for four positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">His nomination for State Secretary, Victoria was received by Mr Pryor at 2.18 pm on 16 January 2007; his nomination for National Secretary was received by Mr Peisley at 9.55 am on 31 January 2007; his nomination for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members) was received by Mr Peisley at 2.24 pm on 4 February 2007; and his nomination for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria was received by Mr Pryor at 3.11 pm on 4 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Wisniewski's application is for an inquiry into the elections for those four offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The applicant in the third proceeding, no VID 190 of 2007, Michael Joseph Nicolaides, is not a candidate for any of the relevant offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">His application seeks inquiries into the elections for: State Secretary, Victoria; Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria; and Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Nicolaides alleges that irregularities have happened in relation to the nominations of two persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Doug McMinimee was nominated for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria and for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mr Pryor received the former nomination at 1.30 pm on 4 February 2007 and Mr Peisley the latter at 2.24 pm on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Ray Campbell was nominated for Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria and for National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Pryor received the former nomination at 8.47 am on 16 January 2007 and Mr Peisley received the latter at 2.27 pm on 4 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">5 The closing time for nominations was 12.00 noon on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Shortly afterwards, some candidates wrote letters to the returning officers, drawing their attention to r 5.5, of which the returning officers had not been aware.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The returning officers resolved to seek legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">While the returning officers were awaiting legal advice, the candidates who had been nominated for offices caught by r 5.5 also received information to the effect that there might be problems with their nominations as a consequence of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 23 February 2007, Mr Pryor received a letter from Mr Reid, withdrawing his nomination for State Secretary, Victoria; two letters from Mr Wisniewski, withdrawing his nomination for State Secretary, Victoria and his nomination for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members); a letter from Mr McMinimee, withdrawing his nomination for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria; and a letter from Mr Campbell, withdrawing his nomination for National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr Pryor forwarded to Mr Peisley by facsimile transmission the letters from Mr Wisniewski and Mr Reid on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">6 After receiving and considering legal advice, the returning officers contacted Mr Wisniewski and Mr McMinimee and indicated that, if those candidates so desired, the returning officers would not accept the withdrawals of their first in time nominations, on the basis that the returning officers had formed the view that the first in time nominations were the only valid ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Mr Peisley advised Mr Campbell that he would reject his nomination for National Secretary, and that Mr Pryor would accept his nomination for Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">7 The returning officers rejected both nominations of Mr Reid on the basis that he already held yet another office entitling him to sit on the National Conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Mr Peisley advised Mr Reid to this effect by telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In consequence of discussions between the Court, counsel for Mr Reid and counsel for the returning officers on the first return of proceeding no VID173 of 2007 on 6 March 2007, the returning officers have now accepted that the decisions to reject the nominations of Mr Reid on this basis amounted to irregularities in the conduct of the respective elections for the offices of State Secretary, Victoria and National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">They have rescinded the decisions to reject both Mr Reid's nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Instead, they have decided to accept the first in time nomination of Mr Reid, for the office of State Secretary, Victoria, and to reject his nomination for National Secretary on the basis that it is invalid because of the earlier nomination for State Secretary, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">No party to these proceedings has taken objection to the rescission of the decisions of the returning officers to reject both nominations of Mr Reid on the basis that he already held an office entitling him to sit on the National Conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It appears to me to be clear that r 5.5 does not disentitle Mr Reid to be nominated in the current elections for an office entitling him to sit on the National Conference on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">If he should succeed in being elected to such a position, on taking office in that position Mr Reid would be taken to have resigned from the office he already holds that entitles him to sit on the National Conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">This would be an application of the doctrine of incompatible offices, discussed further in [19] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">If r 5.5 did have the effect of preventing Mr Reid from nominating in the current elections for any office that would entitle him to sit on the National Conference if he were elected to it, on the basis that he already holds such an office, it is very likely that the rule would be found to contravene s 142(1)(c) of Sch 1 to the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The rule would be held to impose on members conditions, obligations or restrictions that would be oppressive, unreasonable or unjust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">A decision to this effect has been made by the Industrial Registrar, in refusing to certify an amendment to the Union's rules that would have inserted a rule expressly having the effect of disentitling anyone holding an office entitling them to sit on the National Conference from nominating for another such office without resigning the office already held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">8 As the returning officers have rescinded their decisions to reject both nominations of Mr Reid on the ground that he already holds an office entitling him to sit on the National Conference, those rejection decisions need not concern me further in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I am only concerned with the decisions to reject Mr Reid's nomination for National Secretary, and to accept his nomination for State Secretary, Victoria, on the basis that the nomination Mr Pryor accepted was lodged first in time, and he decided not to accept its withdrawal by Mr Reid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Consistently with the returning officers' view that the nominations lodged first in time were the only valid ones, and with their decisions not to accept the withdrawals of those nominations, the returning officers rejected the nominations of Mr Wisniewski for all the offices for which he was nominated, except State Secretary, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Peisley rejected the nomination of Mr McMinimee for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members) and Mr Pryor accepted his nomination for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Mr Pryor also accepted the nomination of Mr Campbell for the office of Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria, and Mr Peisley rejected his nomination for National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Because the nomination of Mr Campbell for National Secretary was rejected on the basis that his other nomination was lodged first, Mr Peisley apparently did not find it necessary to consider whether to accept the withdrawal of the nomination for National Secretary, which he received on 23 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">9 In consequence of the returning officers' decisions, Mr Peisley took the view that there was only one candidate for each of the offices of National Secretary and Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Each of those candidates was declared elected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The returning officers began making preparations to conduct the necessary ballots for other offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The ballot papers were due to be printed on 9 March 2007, but the returning officers postponed this step until 16 March 2007, pending resolution of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The effect of rule 5.5 
 
10 Although it uses the word 'election' in the singular, it seems very clear that r 5.5 is intended to apply to cases in which elections for a number of different offices within the Union are conducted concurrently, a practice which is apparently common in the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Because of the use in the media of the word 'election' to refer to a general election, ie the concurrent conduct of elections in various constituencies to return members to Parliament, the word 'election' has come to be used as signifying the concurrent conduct of a number of elections for different positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Counsel for Mr Reid and Mr Wisniewski attempted to argue that r 5.5 was applicable only to those elections in which more than one position is available (of which state organisers in a particular State branch may be an example).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Such a construction would certainly give r 5.5 some work to do, but it would deprive the rule of the effect it is obviously intended to have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The rule is clearly designed to facilitate the conduct of concurrent elections for a range of offices in the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">If members were able to nominate for, and potentially to be elected to, more than one office entitling them to sit on the National Conference, further elections would be necessary to fill the vacancies created by each of those members either choosing the one position he or she would occupy, or by the operation of some legal principle, such as the doctrine of incompatible offices, imposing that choice on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Plainly, as a deliberative body, the National Conference could not have a person exercising more than one vote in its deliberations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Once it is understood that this is the purpose of r 5.5, effect can be given to it without undue strain on the language, by construing the word 'election' as applicable to the concurrent conduct of elections for various offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">11 Three competing contentions were advanced as to the effect of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">As I have said, the returning officers adopted the 'first in time' view, namely that it is the first nomination received from a person that is effective, all subsequent nominations being rendered ineffective by the lodging of the first nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Counsel for the Union and counsel for Mr Nicolaides (who also appeared by leave for various other candidates for the relevant offices, including those declared elected unopposed to the offices to which I have referred in [9]) contended for a 'nothing valid' position, namely that if there were multiple nominations of one person for offices caught by r 5.5, none of those nominations could be valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">By way of amendment to their applications, made at the hearing of the inquiries on 14 March 2007, Mr Reid and Mr Wisniewski argued for a 'last in time' position, namely that by lodging a second or subsequent nomination, necessarily inconsistent with the first because of r 5.5, the candidate was taken to have elected to have treated the earlier nomination as withdrawn, in favour of the second or subsequent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The consequence of this view, according to counsel for Mr Reid and Mr Wisniewski, was that Mr Reid should be treated as a candidate for the office of National Secretary, and Mr Wisniewski as a candidate for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria, on the basis that their earlier nominations had been withdrawn or surrendered impliedly by the lodging of the later nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It is necessary to examine each of these contentions, for the purpose of determining which is correct, as they appear to exhaust the logical possibilities for the effect of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">12 The 'first in time' view is said to find some support in Re Thomas and South Australian Branch of the Australian Workers' Union (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Keely J, 11 June 1992).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The relevant rule of the organisation there in question was r 74(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It provided that no member should be eligible to nominate for or hold at any one time more than one salaried office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">There was also a provision that candidates, with the consent of their nominators, might withdraw their nominations for any positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In the course of his reasons for judgment, Keely J said:
 
 'I am not prepared to accept the applicant's submission that each of the nominations lodged (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">before any withdrawals) was necessarily contrary to r.74(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However I accept that each of any multiple nominations was contrary to r.74(g) if those multiple nominations were either lodged by the candidate at the same time or lodged in such a way that the returning officer is unable to determine which one (if any) was lodged first; in each of those two sets of circumstances I accept that all of the nominations so lodged are contrary to r.74(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">' 
 

13 His Honour then rejected the submission that a candidate could lodge as many nominations as he or she liked provided that sufficient of them were withdrawn to comply with the substantive part of r 74(g) by the time the returning officer considered the final nominations, after the period for nominations had closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">His Honour took the view that the submission flew in the face of the plain meaning of r 74(g), the purpose of which was to prevent multiple nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In his Honour's view, the provision of the rules of the organisation permitting candidates to withdraw their nominations was not intended to give a candidate who had lodged multiple nominations in breach of r 74(g) an opportunity to overcome the effect of the breach by withdrawing one or some.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">14 In the paragraph I have quoted from Thomas , it is not clear that Keely J was of the view that, if it were possible for the returning officer to determine which of a candidate's nominations had been lodged first in time, then the first in time should prevail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">All that his Honour said was that, only if nominations were lodged simultaneously, or it was impossible to determine which of them had been lodged first, could it be said that all were invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is true that there is some attraction in the simplicity of the reasoning that it is only the existence of the nomination that is first in time that brings about any conflict between a rule such as r 5.5 and any nomination subsequently received by a returning officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">This reasoning suggests that the second nomination does not invalidate the first, but it is the presence of the first that causes the second to be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It is not necessarily reasoning that is supported by authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">15 Counsel for the Union, whose submissions on this point were adopted by counsel for Mr Nicolaides and other candidates for whom she also appeared by leave, suggested that the 'nothing valid' contention found support in two authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In Campbell v Bogar (unreported, Full Court of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Ryan, Moore and North JJ, 3 July 1996), the Court referred to what is in effect the current r 5.5 of the Union's rules, which was then numbered as r 3(7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Court's examination of this rule was in the context of transitional rules that were designed to facilitate the amalgamation of earlier registered organisations to become the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">At issue was the question whether the office of Federal Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, was a full-time office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Court's examination of r 3(7) was in the context of determining this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In the course of setting out its reasoning as to the relationship between provisions of a transitional rule and provisions that were of more permanent duration, the Court said: "the combined effect of r 3(7) [and other provisions of rule 3] is to prohibit a person nominating for the office of both Regional Secretary and Assistant National Secretary Food and Confectionery Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">" This was simply a statement of the effect of r 3(7), in conjunction with other provisions of the Union's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Court did not deal at all with the consequences of a person nominating for more than one office, in contravention of r 3(7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">16 Counsel for the Union also argued that the 'nothing valid' view drew support from the judgment of North J in Re Bogar and Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union, Food and Confectionery Division (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, North J, 28 August 1998).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In that case, his Honour dealt with the provisions of what appear by then to have become r 3(8) of the rules of the Union, which were the same as the relevant provisions of the current r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It appeared that one candidate had been nominated for both Tasmanian Regional Secretary and Federal Secretary of the Food and Confectionery Division of the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The candidate had been declared elected unopposed as Tasmanian Regional Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The inquiry before North J was solely into the election for the office of Federal Secretary of the Food and Confectionery Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The question was whether the candidate's nomination for that office should have been accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In the course of his reasons for judgment, North J referred to the judgment of the Full Court of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia in the earlier Bogar case, quoting substantial passages, including the passage I have quoted above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">His Honour went on to say:
 
 'The decision of the Full Court is clear authority that r 3(8) prohibits a person nominating for the offices of Federal Secretary of the Division and Regional Secretary of the Division outside the transitional period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">' 
 

17 North J then held that the nomination of the relevant candidate for the position of Federal Secretary of the Food and Confectionery Division had been accepted in breach of r 3(8), and that this was an irregularity in the election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">His Honour does not appear to have made any finding as to the order in which the two nominations had been received by the returning officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It is not clear that the conclusion was based either on the assumption that the 'first in time' view should prevail, or that the 'nothing valid' view was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">His Honour did not attempt to deal with the question of the validity of the candidate's election to the position of Tasmanian Regional Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In other words, what his Honour said simply restated the effect of what is now r 5.5, but did not deal in any way with the consequences of a contravention of that rule, other than to hold that the acceptance of the one nomination relevant to the proceeding before him amounted to an irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The result is explicable on the basis that it was unclear whether there was any difference in the time of lodging of the two nominations but, having been declared elected as Tasmanian Regional Secretary, the candidate must have been taken to have elected to treat the nomination for that office as valid, which necessitated that the nomination for Federal Secretary of the Food and Confectionery Division was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">18 It can be seen that the 'nothing valid' argument gains no real support from either Bogar judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Each did nothing more than state the effect of what is now r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">No conclusion can be drawn that, in all circumstances, every nomination received for an office to which r 5.5 applies will be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The contention, put by counsel for the Union, that the Union has organised its affairs on the basis of this interpretation, which has become settled, cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">It is an unattractive contention, because rules of organisations ought to be construed in favour of eligibility to stand for election, if that be possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">This approach is consonant with all of the learning relating to the participation by members in the conduct of the affairs of an organisation, and the democratic control of organisations, both ends to which the legislation aspires in its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">There is no particular reason why every one of multiple nominations should be treated as invalid, in circumstances in which it is possible to identify one that would be the cause of the others being in contravention of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">If anything, at least where the order in which nominations have been lodged can be determined, the 'nothing valid' argument is inconsistent with the assumption that appears to have underlain what Keely J said in Thomas , and the result in the second Bogar case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">19 The 'last in time' argument is novel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It has not been considered expressly by any court previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It is based on the principle of surrender by implication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">That principle has been applied as the doctrine of incompatible offices in cases such as Egan v Maher [No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">2] (1978) 35 FLR 252 at 263, Mellor v Horn (1988) 25 IR 157 at 159 --- 161 and Johnson v Beitseen (1989) 41 IR 395 at 412 --- 413.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In Re Cholosznecki; Re Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2006] FCA 452 (2006) 151 IR 218, the principle of implied surrender was applied in determining that a member of an organisation had surrendered her membership of one of its branches by applying to become, and being accepted and treated as, a member of another branch, where membership of more than one branch was expressly prohibited by the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The principle operates by implication of law, rather than by implied intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The intention is imputed to a person, as a result of the assumption of a second position incompatible with the first, to relinquish the first position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The principle is subject to the express provisions of the rules, but not easily displaced by them, because it has been held to apply even where there were express, mandatory provisions about resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The principle of implied surrender is analysed in Cholosznecki at [29] --- [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In the present case, counsel for Mr Reid and Mr Wisniewski contended that r 5.5 does nothing more than to bring forward the operation of the doctrine of incompatible offices to the stage where nominations for offices occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He argued that, just as the assumption of a second office, incompatible with one already held, is taken to be an implied resignation of the first office, so the lodging of a second nomination, incompatible with one already lodged, is taken to be the implied withdrawal of the first nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">20 Having considered the arguments and the available authorities, I am of the view that the 'last in time' argument is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The doctrine of incompatible offices is but an example of the broader principle of surrender by implication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">This was made clear by Willes J in the case to which the doctrine of incompatible offices has been traced, Iron Ship Coating Co Ltd v Blunt (1868) LR 3 CP 484 at 488.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The principle itself is related to the common law doctrine of election between inconsistent rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">This relationship was explored in the judgment of Northrop J (with whom Evatt J agreed) in Egan at 263 --- 264, where his Honour referred to Tropical Traders Ltd v Goonan [1964] HCA 20 ; (1964) 111 CLR 41 and Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In Tropical Traders at 55, Kitto J (with whom Taylor and Menzies JJ agreed) said:
 
 'not that election is a matter of intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It is an effect which the law annexes to conduct which would be justifiable only if an election had been made one way or the other'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">


This view was followed by Stephen J in Sargent at 646.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Also in Sargent , at 656, Mason J said:
 
 'in some instances election may take place as a matter of conscious choice with knowledge of the existence of the alternative right and in other cases it may occur when the law attributes the character of an election to the conduct of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

21 There is therefore no reason not to apply the principle of implied surrender and, to the extent necessary, its related principles about election between inconsistent rights, beyond the acquisition of another office, or of membership of another branch, to matters such as the lodging of nominations in circumstances where two or more nominations cannot stand alongside each other, because of the existence of a rule such as r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Indeed, such an extension could provide the key to the situation to which Keely J alluded in Thomas , namely that multiple nominations arrive at the same time, or in circumstances in which it is impossible for the returning officer to determine which arrived first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In such cases, the returning officer might require the candidate concerned to elect expressly as to which of the nominations he or she wished to retain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In cases such as the present, when it is possible to determine in which order the nominations were lodged, the law attaches to the lodging of a later nomination the consequence that the candidate concerned can no longer rely on the former.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The later nomination is an implied withdrawal of the earlier nomination, not by way of implied intention to withdraw, but by way of imputed intention to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">22 It is no answer to this line of argument to say that, at the time when it arrives, the later nomination is invalid because of the former.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">As Northrop J (Evatt J agreeing, Smithers J dissenting on this point) made clear in Egan at 262, the inconsistent assumption of rights does not have to be valid in order to constitute an implied surrender of the original right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In that case, the holder of the office of National Assistant Secretary of an organisation accepted appointment to the office of National Secretary-Treasurer, on the assumption that there was a vacancy in the latter office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The Court held that in law there was no vacancy in the office of National Secretary-Treasurer, but the officer concerned was nonetheless taken to have resigned impliedly from his position as National Assistant Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In any event, in a case such as the present, there is no particular ground for holding that a second or subsequent nomination is invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">When it is received, all that can be said is that there have been two acts of the candidate which cannot stand together, because of the operation of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">As a logical proposition, it is equally open to say that the second nomination invalidates the first as it is to say that the first nomination invalidates the second.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I have come to the conclusion that the principle of implied surrender requires that the law take the view that it is the first nomination that is surrendered impliedly by the lodging of the second.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The first becomes invalid, not the second.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The adoption of such a proposition does not offend on policy grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Policy is blind to the relative importance of the two or more positions for which nominations have been received, and to the personalities of those who have been nominated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">No greater inconvenience is caused to a returning officer who must determine, at the date of closure of nominations, which of the nominations is the one that can be treated as valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">'Last in time' is a simple rule to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">23 Keely J in Thomas did not consider any of these issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">His Honour's reasoning is sparse, to the point where it is not even possible to assume that his Honour did adopt the 'first in time' option, from the fact that his Honour made reference to the problem of simultaneous receipt of nominations, or receipt of nominations in circumstances in which it is unclear in which order they have been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In my view, if it had been necessary, his Honour might well have taken the view that the principle of implied surrender operated, so that the last nomination received would prevail, and that the problem of simultaneous nominations would be resolved by applying the doctrine of election between inconsistent rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">As I have said, the result in the second Bogar case is explicable on the basis that North J was dealing only with one of the two nominations, there was no evidence of the timing of the two nominations, and the case may simply have been one of the candidate's election between inconsistent rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">No authority stands in the way of the adoption of the 'last in time' view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The authorities to which I have referred about previous applications of the principle of implied surrender support the argument that it applies to a situation such as that of multiple nominations, when only one can be valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I accept that argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It remains to apply the principle to the facts of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The application of rule 5.5 
 
24 The adoption of the view that the last nomination received from each of the relevant candidates is taken to involve an implied withdrawal of all of the previous inconsistent nominations leads to the conclusion that the elections should proceed on the basis that: Mr Reid is a candidate for National Secretary, but not for State Secretary, Victoria; Mr Wisniewski is a candidate for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria but not for any of the other three positions for which he was nominated; and Mr McMinimee is a candidate for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members) and not for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">But for one further factual matter, Mr Campbell would have to be treated as a candidate for National Secretary, but not for Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionary Division, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The withdrawal of Mr Campbell's nomination for National Secretary 
 
25 On 22 February 2007, Mr Campbell sent by facsimile transmission a hand-written letter, dated 'Thursday 22 5.23 pm', addressed to Mr Pryor, and apparently received at 9.26 am on the following morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The letter simply says:
 
 'I wish to withdraw my nomination for the Position of NATIONAL SECRETARY of the A.M.W.U.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">' 
 

It is apparently signed by Mr Campbell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">There is nothing unequivocal about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">26 Mr Peisley decided that it was unnecessary to accept the withdrawal of Mr Campbell's nomination for National Secretary, because he had already decided not to accept that nomination, on the basis that it was received second in time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The returning officers did decide not to accept the withdrawals of nominations forwarded by Mr Reid, Mr Wisniewski and Mr McMinimee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Their decisions were made on the basis that the withdrawals were submitted before the returning officers had received legal advice and made a decision about the validity of the second and subsequent nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">They were being generous to those three candidates, because of the uncertainty about the consequences of more than one nomination and the effect of r 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It is unnecessary for me to decide whether the returning officers had power not to accept the withdrawals of the nominations of those three candidates because, on the view I take, the relevant nominations ought to have been rejected in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I tend to take the view that the returning officers had no power to decline to accept the withdrawals of nominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Counsel for the returning officers was unable to point to any possible source of such power, whether in the Union's rules or in the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He made reference to s 193(1)(b)(i) in Sch 1 to the WR Act, which empowers an electoral official to take such action, and give such directions, as he or she considers necessary to ensure that no irregularities occur in or in relation to an election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The withdrawal of a nomination, even in a state of uncertainty as to whether the nomination or another nomination is invalid, does not amount to an irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The returning officers were obliged to accept any withdrawal of nomination they received, provided that it came from the candidate concerned, and to give effect to it as a withdrawal of any valid nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Campbell's withdrawal of his nomination for National Secretary was effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">At least once the withdrawal was received by Mr Peisley, Mr Campbell was no longer a candidate for the office of National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">27 The withdrawal of his nomination for National Secretary did not lead to the result that Mr Campbell's earlier nomination was revived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">That nomination was invalid, as a result of the application of the principle of implied surrender, at the time when his nomination for National Secretary arrived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Having once been invalid, it could not be revived by the withdrawal of the nomination that caused its invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The consequence is that Mr Campbell is no longer a candidate for the office of Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria, or for the office of National Secretary, in the elections currently being conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Other issues 
 
28 Having taken the view that I have as to the validity of the last in time nominations of the candidates concerned, I find it unnecessary to deal with the question whether the invalidity of the other nominations, as a consequence of the application of r 5.5, was such as to amount to a 'defect' for the purposes of the application of r 4.6 of the Union's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">That rule is intended to conform with the requirement, now found in s 143(1)(c) of Sch 1 to the WR Act, that the rules of an organisation:
 
 'must provide that, if the returning officer conducting an election finds a nomination to be defective, the returning officer must, before rejecting the nomination, notify the person concerned of the defect and, where practicable, give the person the opportunity of remedying the defect within such period as is applicable under the rules, which must, where practicable, be not less than seven days after the person is notified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">' 


On the question of what it means for a nomination to be defective, there is a conflict of authority between Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Troja (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Keely J, 19 July 1988) on the one hand and Wilcox J in Hickson v Australian Electoral Commission (1997) 76 IR 127 and the Full Court in Australian Electoral Commission v Hickson (1997) 76 IR 399 on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The conflict is essentially over whether, in a case in which the flaw in a nomination is such that it could not be remedied, the nomination must nevertheless be considered defective, and the requisite notice be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In the present case, the returning officers considered that nothing could be done to validate the invalid nominations, and that they were therefore not defective for the purposes of r 4.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">29 There are difficulties about both views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">That of Keely J leads to difficult problems of definition, and possibly greater likelihood of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The views expressed in the Hickson cases appear to take little or no account of the provision in s 143(5) of Sch 1 to the WR Act, which excludes from the reference in s 143(1)(c) to a nomination being defective the situation in which the nomination is defective "because the person is not qualified to hold the office to which the nomination relates".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In addition, Hickson concerned a nomination that was manifestly defective, in that one of the nominators turned out to be not capable of being a nominator, by reason of being unfinancial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Such a defect is manifestly capable of correction, either by the payment of arrears of dues, or by the substitution of another financial member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Interestingly, although Goldberg J in Re Wall; Re inquiry relating to an election for an office in the Ansett Pilots Association [2000] FCA 1568 (2000) 102 IR 379 at [19] --- [29], said that he agreed with the view of Wilcox J in Hickson , and that nothing justified drawing a distinction between a defective nomination and one that is fundamentally flawed, his Honour stated his conclusion in terms that the relevant nomination was to be considered as defective and capable of being remedied, rather than being a nullity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">In the circumstances of the present case, I do not have to decide these issues and I prefer to express no concluded view about them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Appropriate orders 
 
30 As a result of reaching the conclusions I have expressed as to the validity of the last in time nominations, I made declarations identifying the various irregularities that have occurred in the elections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Those are true declarations of right, made in the exercise of the power granted to the Court by s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), because they resolve a controversy between the parties about the validity of nominations, and lay down the basis on which the returning officers can act in the continued conduct of the elections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The irregularities are the acceptance of the nominations of: Mr Reid for State Secretary, Victoria; Mr Wisniewski for State Secretary, Victoria; Mr McMinimee for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria; and Mr Campbell for Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">31 Section 206(5) of Sch 1 to the WR Act provides:
 
 'The Court must not declare an election, or any step taken in relation to an election, to be void, or declare that a person was not elected, unless the Court is of the opinion that, having regard to the irregularity found, and any circumstances giving rise to a likelihood that similar irregularities may have happened or may happen, the result of the election may have been affected, or may be affected, by irregularities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">' 
 

It is almost axiomatic that the continuance of an election in which a person not entitled to be a candidate is treated as a candidate, or a person entitled to be a candidate is not treated as a candidate, may affect the result of the election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It is unnecessary to look at the question whether circumstances exist that give rise to a likelihood that similar irregularities may have happened or may happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The absence of the name of a proper candidate from the ballot papers, and the presence of the name of a candidate whose name should not be present on the ballot papers, have the potential to falsify the result of the election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The former prevents those voters who would have chosen to vote in favour of the absent but entitled candidate from exercising their right to vote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The latter is likely to cause some voters to throw away their votes on a candidate for whom they do not have a right to vote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">If a sufficient number should do so, that candidate may be elected, and the result of the election would be thereby falsified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The only way to ensure that the result of the election is not affected is to ensure that only the names of candidates entitled to be nominated for particular offices, and the names of all candidates entitled to be nominated for particular offices, appear on the ballot papers in respect of those offices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">32 For this reason, I have exercised the power conferred on the Court by s 206(4)(a) of Sch 1 to the WR Act to declare void various steps in the subject elections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">I have declared void the rejection of the nominations of: Mr Reid for National Secretary; Mr Wisniewski for Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria; Mr McMinimee for Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members); and Mr Campbell for National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is not necessary to make any order in relation to the rejection of the nominations of Mr Wisniewski for the offices of National Secretary and Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members).</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">On any view, the rejection of these nominations was in accordance with the Union's rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Because there is properly more than one nomination for each of the offices of National Secretary and Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), I have also declared that the declaration of the result of the election for each of those offices is void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Finally, I have declared that Mr Campbell withdrew his nomination for the office of National Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Because of that withdrawal, he is no longer entitled to be a candidate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Again, this is an exercise of the power to make a declaration of right, rather than an exercise of the specific power to declare steps in an election void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">It enables the election for National Secretary to continue on a proper footing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">33 The consequence of making the declarations that various steps already taken in the elections are void is that it is necessary to make orders pursuant to the power granted by s 206(4)(c) of Sch 1 to the WR Act for the uncompleted steps in the elections to be taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I have made such orders, including orders that those steps be taken on specific bases (that named persons are, or are not, candidates for particular offices).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">I have taken the power to extend to the making of such specific orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The orders appear in a somewhat peculiar form, in that they are by way of directions to the Industrial Registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">This is because the power in s 206(4)(c) is conferred on the Court in that form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The underlying reason is that the Australian Electoral Commission, and thus the returning officers, perform their functions in relation to the elections in consequence of an arrangement made with the Australian Electoral Commission by the Industrial Registrar, in the exercise of the power conferred on the latter by s 189(3) of Sch 1 to the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Although the Industrial Registrar is not a party to any of these proceedings, and the returning officers are, by virtue of having sought and been granted leave to appear, s 206(4)(c) proceeds on the assumption that it is necessary to make orders for further arrangements to be made by the Industrial Registrar, rather than orders that the returning officers take the uncompleted steps in the elections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">34 I have therefore ordered that the Industrial Registrar make arrangements for the completion of the uncompleted steps in the elections by conducting a ballot for the office of National Secretary, in which Mr Reid is a candidate, but Mr Campbell is not, and conducting a ballot for the office of Assistant National Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), in which Mr McMinimee is a candidate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Similarly, I have made orders that will ensure that the ballot that will take place in any event for the office of Assistant State Secretary (Metals and Engineering Members), Victoria must include Mr Wisniewski as a candidate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">35 Apart from reserving liberty to apply, the only other orders I have made are orders terminating each of the inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The orders are by no means simple, because I have taken the view that I can only make orders relating to the elections the subject of each specific proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">There is therefore no single one of the three proceedings in which a complete set of the orders has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In addition, there is repetition, with some identical orders being made in more than one proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Each inquiry is a separate proceeding, with a separate applicant, so that I have taken the view that each applicant is entitled to have made such orders as can be made in his inquiry (although not necessarily the orders sought by him), even though identical orders may be made in one or both of the other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Because I have found in each inquiry that an irregularity has occurred in relation to at least some of the relevant elections, although not necessarily the irregularity that Mr Nicolaides was seeking to have me find in relation to any of the elections the subject of proceeding no VID190 of 2007, it appears that I have no power to grant a certificate that any of the applicants acted reasonably in applying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Section 325(1) of Sch 1 to the WR Act provides for the grant of such a certificate, which is relevant to an application pursuant to s 324 of Sch 1 to the WR Act for financial assistance, in a case in which the Court does not find that an irregularity happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Section 329 of Sch 1 to the WR Act also precludes me from making any order for costs against any party, unless the proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">I certainly could not find that any of these three inquiries was so instituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Associate:
