<sentence id="s0">
 This proceeding was heard immediately after argument had concluded in Dunn v Australian Crime Commission [2008] FCA 424.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It was convenient to follow this course because the applicant sought, and had been granted leave, to rely on the same evidence which had been tendered in the Dunn case in this proceeding and because, apart from two additional matters, the same grounds and argument as had been advanced in Dunn were pursued in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Dunn was concerned with a challenge to the lawfulness of a request, made by a delegate of the Commonwealth Attorney-General, to Swiss authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The request was made under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) ("the Mutual Assistance Act") and the Treaty between Australia and Switzerland on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Berne in Switzerland on 25 November 1991 ("the Treaty").</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It asked the Swiss authorities to obtain and execute search warrants to seize documents which were sought in relation to an investigation known as "Operation Wickenby".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The mutual assistance request suggested that relevant documents might be found in the applicant's premises in Switzerland upon the execution of search warrants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The grounds of the present application which are common to the grounds relied on in Dunn are that: Necessary preconditions (under the statutory regime and the Treaty) for the making of a valid application for assistance under the Mutual Assistance Act were not observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The request misstated a number of important facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The involvement of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in the making of the request was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The involvement of the Australian Crime Commission ("the ACC") and the making of the mutual assistance request was also unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
These grounds are dealt with in the reasons for judgment in Dunn at [15] to [80].</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Each fails for the reasons given in Dunn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 The two additional grounds which are peculiar to the present proceeding concern certain factual allegations which were made in the mutual assistance request and in correspondence sent by Australian authorities to Swiss authorities in December 2005 which is referred to in the reasons for judgment in Dunn as "the November letter" because the documents were written and dated in that month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is contended that: It was implied in the mutual assistance request that two persons, who were identified in that document as being subject to criminal investigation, were at relevant times Australian residents for taxation purposes when this was, in fact, not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">A letter, written by solicitors, was wrongly described in the November letter as a "False or Fictitious Document[s] produced by Strachans SA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">" 
These alleged defects, together with those referred to in paragraph [3] above, it was contended, caused the mutual assistance request to have been made "without authority, outside jurisdiction or unlawfully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">" The consequence was said to be that it was "invalid" and that it must, therefore, be set aside or quashed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The persons whose residential status for tax purposes was said to have been misstated in the mutual assistance request may be referred to as H and C. The passages in the mutual assistance request on which the applicant relies to found the implied statement that H and C falsely stated to be Australian residents at relevant times are the following: 
 "7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Australian authorities are investigating a number of Australian residents for using companies, trusts and bank accounts administered by Strachans S.A., an accountancy services firm in Switzerland, to disguise their involvement in tax fraud schemes and money laundering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">

 In February 2004, Philip Egglishaw, one of the principals of Strachans, travelled to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">While in Australia, the ACC compelled Egglishaw to produce documents and his personal computer and to attend an ACC hearing to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">From this, the ACC learnt that Strachans administers various companies, trusts and bank accounts based in foreign countries on behalf of, and for the benefit of, a number of Australian residents and their families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The ACC believes the services provided by Strachans enables Australian residents to:
 
 (a) accumulate substantial assets overseas in companies and trusts hidden behind an impenetrable veil of incorporation
 (b) create misleading documents which assist in defrauding the Commonwealth of Australia, and
 (c) access their funds administered by Strachans from anywhere in the world by the use of debit or credit cards linked to bank accounts opened and operated for them by Strachans outside Australia, including at Corner Banca, SA in Lugarno, Switzerland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">

 Based on the information obtained from Egglishaw, the ACC commenced criminal investigations into suspected fraud and money laundering by a number of Australian residents who have utilised the services provided by Strachans and Corner Banca.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 ... 

 A schedule that was recovered from Egglishaw listing the Australian clients and the intermediaries provides a key link that identifies the offshore companies and trusts that Strachans operates on behalf of individual clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Each entity operated by Strachans is given a name and a four figure reference number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The names of the individual clients believed to be in criminal activity are:
 
 ... 

 
 (j) H 
 (k) C
 ... 

 Each of these clients and their respective entities are discussed in detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 
Between paragraphs 69 and 83, the mutual assistance request detailed various allegations against TS (an accountant and financial adviser), H and C. In paragraph 70 it was said:
 
 "[TS] is an accountant and financial adviser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He is also a principal of the [S] group of companies located in Sydney, Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He has a number of clients who are very prominent in the film industry including [H] and [C], who he has been associated with since 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">He also has clients who live in the United Kingdom and the United States of America who are prominent in the motion picture industry, namely [E] and [S]..." 

The principal allegations against H and C were said, by the applicant, to relate to the non-disclosure and non-payment of tax on income earned overseas in relation to non-Australian property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The applicant submits that these passages imply, contrary to the fact, that H and C were both residents of Australia between 1995 and 2005 for taxation purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The implication is said to arise from the distinction drawn, in paragraph 70, between E and S on the one hand and H and C on the other, suggesting that H and C are Australian residents because the overseas residency status of E and S is expressly referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">A more general contention is also made, namely, that the mutual assistance request was made on an unstated premise that the persons who were the subject of allegations made in it were, at relevant times, Australian residents unless the contrary was expressly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The unstated premise is said to arise because, so it is said, offences of the kind alleged against H and C could not be committed by non-resident tax payers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Having considered the terms of the request, the Swiss authorities, by letter dated 10 October 2005, sought clarification of the residency status of both H and C. Specifically the question asked was "Do [H and C], had (sic) their residence in Australia and/or were they Australian taxpayers during the period for which the investigation is lead (sic)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">" The November letter responded to this query as follows: 
 "Income Tax Returns show that Mr [H] declared himself to be a non resident of Australia for the financial years ending 30 June 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">

 
 Income Tax Returns show that Mr [H] declared himself to be a resident of Australia for the financial years ending 30 June 2003 and 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As yet he has not lodged an Income Tax Return in respect of the 2005 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

 
 Notwithstanding him being a non resident for a number of years he was still an Australian taxpayer and lodged Income Tax Returns for each of the years 1995 to 2004 as non residents of Australia are subject to tax on income sourced in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">While resident outside of Australia Mr [H] continued to be a director and shareholder in a number of Australian resident companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">

 
 In a statement believed to have been provided by [H] to the Internal Revenue Service in the United States of America in 2003/2004 he stated that his personal and economic relations were closest to Australia where he maintains his permanent home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
 Income Tax Returns show that Mr [C] declared himself to be a non resident of Australia for the financial years ending 30 June 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

 
 Income Tax Returns show that Mr [C] declared himself to be a resident of Australia for the financial years ending 30 June 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">As yet he has not lodged an Income Tax Return in respect of the 2005 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">

 
 Notwithstanding him being a non resident for a number of years he was still an Australian taxpayer and lodged income tax returns for each of the years 1995 to 2004 as non residents of Australia are subject to tax on income sourced in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">While resident outside Australia Mr [C] continued to be a director and shareholder in a number of Australia resident companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">" 
 The applicant contends that the information contained in the November letter relating to H and C accurately states the residency position of H and C. It says further that these were material facts which should have been, but were not, disclosed in the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In Dunn at [45] to [52] I considered, and rejected, a submission that the Commonwealth Attorney-General was under an obligation, when making a mutual assistance request, to disclose to the Requested State all material facts relevant to the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Given that any request would be made in the course of an investigation, I assumed that the alleged obligation could only extend to material facts known to the Requesting State at the time at which the request was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For the reasons given in Dunn I do not consider that the Commonwealth Attorney-General was under an obligation to disclose to the Swiss authorities the residential status of H and C when making the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The applicant may also be understood to have advanced the alternative submission that the mutual assistance request contained misleading information by implying that H and C were Australian residents when, in fact they were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I do not accept these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In the first place the contentions are founded on a mistaken assumption that H and C, had they not been Australian residents, could not have committed offences against Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">They were obliged to comply with Australian taxation law in respect to income sourced in Australia during the period of their non-residency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Secondly, H and C were resident, for taxation purposes, in Australia during at least part of the period covered by the investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">That period, as the Swiss authorities were advised in the November letter, ran from 1 January 1995 to 31 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Thirdly, when the Swiss authorities sought further details about the residency of H and C, the Australian authorities advised that H and C had "declared" themselves to be non-residents for some (but not all) of the financial years falling within the period covered by the investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicant says that this information was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is some ambiguity here because the Australian authorities did no more than tell the Swiss authorities what H and C had declared in their taxation returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">There can be no doubt that this information was uncontentious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I do not understand the Australian authorities to be asserting, as I think the applicant would have it, that the declaration was correct in fact and law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I also note that this part of the applicant's submission is at odds with the submissions made in Dunn that the November letter formed part of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">If it did then the Swiss authorities were advised of the relevant information in the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The second complaint, which is peculiar to the present application, is that, in the November letter, a letter dated 1 February 2005 from Barminco Investments Pty Ltd's legal advisers was wrongly described as a "False or Fictitious Document[s] produced by Strachans".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The mutual assistance request advised the Swiss authorities that two of the persons, under investigation in Operation Wickenby were B and S. It was alleged (at paragraphs 94 to 100) that B and S were involved in fraudulent transactions which were devised for the purposes of defrauding the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In their letter of 10 October 2005 the Swiss authorities asked, in respect of the matters raised in the mutual assistance request concerning B and S: "Is it possible to have more details about the modus operandi used by [B and S] to defraud the Commonwealth?</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">" In the part of the November letter headed "Status of Criminal Investigations" the Australian authorities responded to this request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">They did so in a section of the document headed "False or Fictitious Documents produced by Strachans located in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Immediately below this heading there was a subheading "Dunn" under which there were six paragraphs dealing with Mr Dunn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Three of those paragraphs are set out in the Dunn reasons at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There then followed another subheading "[B and S]" under which the following passages appeared: 
 "A letter from Strachans dated 10 April 2005 to Robin Anderson of Barminco enclosing a receipts and payments statement for Barminco and stating that payments of $800,000 and $2,500,000 to be paid out of Barminco Investments Pty Ltd are not to be treated as repayments of the promissory notes to Crossline but will be shown as payments to one of our in-house companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">(See tab 25).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Evidence obtained by the ACC confirms that $2,500,000 was to be paid to Dunn and the $800,000 to be paid to Dunn, [B and S].</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">

 
 Strachans receipts and payments statement for Barminco (see tab 26).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">

 
 Letter dated 1 February 2005 from Barminco Investments Pty Ltd's legal advisers to Strachans outlining that customers will pay invoiced amounts into the bank account Strachans will open for Barminco and 25% of the payments are to be retained in the account and the balance forwarded to the bank account of Barminco in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">(See tab 27) 

 
 Letter from Strachans dated 13 December 2004 to Barminco Investments Pty Ltd's legal representatives enclosing account opening documents for an account with Credit Suisse Crans-Montana Switzerland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">(See tab 28) 

 
 Two versions of a Strachans receipts and payments scheduled in respect of Crossline Overseas Limited (5041) (See tab 29)" 

 
The letter that appeared at tab 27 was a letter prepared and sent by solicitors Mallesons Stephen Jacques.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The applicant correctly asserts that this letter was not a "False or Fictitious Document[s] produced by Strachans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">" That may be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">What is in issue, however, is whether, on a fair reading, the November letter suggested that it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I do not consider that the relevant passages can be so understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Those passages are set out above at [13].</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The reference to the 1 February 2005 letter makes it plain that that letter was sent by the legal advisors of Barminco Investments Pty Ltd to Strachans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As the next paragraph records, that letter was responsive to the matters raised by Strachans in its letter to Barminco's legal representatives dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The clear words of the text cannot be and are not varied merely because they appear under a general heading which suggests that Strachans created false and fictitious documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">No reasonable reader and, in particular the Swiss authorities, would have or could have so construed the plain words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Even had the applicant's proposed description of the solicitor's letter been correct, the wrong characterisation of one letter could not provide a ground for invalidating the request as a whole even if, contrary to my finding in Dunn , the November letter formed part of the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">DISPOSITION 
 As in Dunn the respondents objected to the application being commenced out of time and opposed any extension of time being granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The findings which I have made in relation to the grounds relied on in the application make it unnecessary to deal with these disputed issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The application should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Associate:
