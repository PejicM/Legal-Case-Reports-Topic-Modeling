 Introduction
 This is one of many cases arising out of the "equity finance transactions" entered into between members of the Opes Prime "Group" of companies and their clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The first respondent to the proceedings, Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd ("Leveraged") and the proposed fourth respondent, Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd ("OPSL") are members of what I will call the Opes Prime Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Administrators were appointed to Leveraged and OPSL on 27 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On the same day, ANZ Banking Group Limited ("ANZ") appointed Receivers and Managers to Leveraged, OPSL and other members of the Opes Prime Group pursuant to fixed and floating charges held by ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 2 May 2008 in the case of Leveraged and 16 October 2008 in the case of OPSL, the creditors of those companies resolved that they be wound up and the Administrators became the Liquidators of each of the companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">These proceedings were commenced on 9 May 2008 when the applicant, Altinova Nominees Pty Ltd ("Altinova"), obtained ex parte interlocutory injunctive relief against Leveraged, the second respondent Mr Emeni, and the third respondent, Green Frog Nominees Pty Limited ("Green Frog").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The substance of Altinova's claim against Leveraged, Mr Emeni and Green Frog is set out at [23] of the reasons for judgment of Lindgren J in Altinova Nominees Pty Limited v Leveraged Capital Pty Limited (2008) 66 ACSR 293.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is that the true arrangement between Altinova's principal, Mr Seckold, and Mr Emeni was a margin loan under which Altinova retained beneficial ownership in the shares deposited initially with OPSL and then Leveraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Altinova has previously obtained leave to proceed against Leveraged when it was in voluntary administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">However, Altinova now seeks leave to proceed against Leveraged following the passing by the creditors of that company of a resolution for it to be wound up: s 500(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Leave is necessary under that sub-section because the winding up of Leveraged is taken to be a creditors' voluntary winding up: s 446A of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In addition, Altinova seeks leave under Order 6.2 (or 6.4 or 6.8) of the Federal Court Rules to join OPSL as the fourth respondent in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">If OPSL is to be joined, Altinova requires leave under s 500(2) of the Corporations Act to proceed against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Leveraged's defence of the proceedings is being conducted on its behalf by the Receivers pursuant to their power under the Charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Receivers will continue to conduct the defence notwithstanding the subsequent appointment of the Liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">However, the Liquidator of Leveraged appeared on the motion and put submissions to me in response to Altinova's application for leave to proceed against Leveraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">No point was taken against the Liquidators that the Receivers are conducting the defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Receivers of Leveraged neither consented nor opposed the application for leave under s 500(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Liquidators accepted that it was appropriate for leave to be granted to proceed against Leveraged but that leave should be limited to the "proprietary claims" against Leveraged and the question of liability for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">But the Liquidators submitted that leave ought not be granted to proceed in relation to the question of the quantum of any damages or compensation for which Leveraged may be found to be liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Receivers of OPSL have indicated that they do not propose to exercise their power under the Charge to defend the proceedings against OPSL if that company is joined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Liquidators submit that leave ought not to be granted to join OPSL or to proceed against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Principal Issues which arise on the applications
 The only real issue which arises on the application for leave to proceed against Leveraged is whether the grant of leave ought to be limited so as to exclude quantification of any monetary claims in the event that Altinova succeeds on the issue of liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The issue which arises on the application to join OPSL and to proceed against it is whether this course ought to be adopted in preference to leaving Altinova to pursue the claim by lodging a proof of debt with the liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is necessary to consider the claims made in the Amended Statement of Claim proposed to be filed by Altinova in order to determine the issues which arise in relation to each of the applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Outline of the proposed claims against Leveraged
 The material facts upon which Altinova relies are not complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">They are sufficiently set out in Lindgren J's reasons for judgment (2008) 66 ACSR 293at [3] --- [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Nevertheless, these facts are said to give rise to a large number of legal consequences as pleaded in the Proposed Amended Statement of Claim ("PASC").</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The relevant claims may be summarised as follows: An equity of redemption based upon implied terms in the margin lending agreement with OPSL which was novated to Leveraged: see [5] --- [13] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That Green Frog holds the securities under an express or resulting trust for Altinova; see [14] --- [16] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">That under a Master Securities Lending Agreement entered into initially with OPSL and replaced by an agreement with Leveraged, Altinova agreed to lend securities only if it elected to do so: see [17] --- [23] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">That securities lent by Altinova to Leveraged would only become subject to the Master Securities Lending Agreement at Altinova's election, and Altinova did not so elect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Altinova seeks a declaration that the securities were transferred to Leveraged under a Second Margin Lending Agreement and not the Second Alleged Master Securities Agreement, and therefore that Altinova's rights as equitable mortgagor and beneficiary in relation to the securities remain: see [17] --- [23] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Various oral representations made by Mr Emeni to Mr Seckold that Altinova's securities would not be lent to short sellers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Similar representations are said to have been made on the Opes Prime Group website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The representations are said to give rise to relief under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (and corresponding State Fair Trading laws) and to proprietary claims: see [24] --- [40] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Alternatively, a breach of the implied terms as to fitness of financial services arising under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (" ASIC Act "): see [41] --- [58] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">] A constructive trust arising ad hoc: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 316: see [59] --- [63] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">A constructive trust arising from an antecedent relationship: see [64] --- [66] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Unconscionable conduct within s 12CB of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This is said to give rise to a proprietary claim to the securities held by Green Frog: see [79] --- [81] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Outline of proposed claims against OPSL
 
 The claims made against OPSL are founded upon s 87 of the Trade Practices Act and alleged contraventions of Ch 7 of the Corporations Act by OPSL as the holder of an Australian financial services licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The essence of the claims seems to be contained in [94] --- [95] PASC in which Altinova pleads that the misleading conduct referred to above also amounted to a breach of OPSL's obligations as a financial services licensee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">These claims are said to give rise to proprietary relief in respect of the securities: see generally [86] --- [97] PASC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The principles applicable to the grant of leave
 In Vagrand Pty Limited (In Liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550 a Full Court of this Court reviewed the relevant authorities in which the applicable principles were stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Those authorities are the decision of McLelland CJ in Eq in Re Sydney Formworks Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) [1965] NSWR 646 ; the decision of Street J in Re AJ Benjamin Limited (In Liq) [1969] 2 NSWR 374 and the decision of McPherson J in Ogilvie-Grant v East (1983) 7 ACLR 669.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">See also the discussion of the authorities of Lehane J in Meehan v Stockmans Australian Caf&eacute; (Holdings) Pty Limited (1996) 22 ACSR 123 at 126-127; by Lee J in Executive Director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management v Ringfab Environmental Structures Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [1997] FCA 1484 and by Finkelstein J in O D Transport (Australia) Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) &amp; Ors v O D Transport Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1997) 80 FCR 289.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The authorities contain two possible explanations of the objective of the predecessor of s 500(2) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The first is that the prohibition on proceeding without the grant of leave is intended to effect the statutory policy of ensuring that the assets are distributed rateably amongst all creditors so that no creditor will obtain an advantage over another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It is important to note that in making this statement in Re Sydney Formworks at 650, McLelland CJ in Eq pointed to the objective of enabling the Court:- 
 ... effectively to supervise all claims brought against the company which is being wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">

 The second explanation is that without the restriction contained in the subsection, a company in liquidation would be subject to a multiplicity of actions which would be expensive, time-consuming, and in some cases unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As McPherson J observed in Ogilvie-Grant at 672, the question of whether leave ought to be granted is reduced to one of choosing between two alternative forms of procedure, namely filing a proof of debt or commencement of legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">His Honour said that the effect of the subsection is that the claimant is required to lodge a proof of debt unless he or she can demonstrate that there is a good reason for departure from that procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">McPherson J also said at 672: 
 It is quite impossible to state in an exhaustive manner all the circumstances in which leave to proceed may be appropriate but .. they ... include factors such as the amount and seriousness of the claim, the degree of complexity of the legal and factual issues involved, and the stage to which the proceedings, if already commenced, may have progressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">

 As the Full Court pointed out in Vagrand at 555-557, the effect of the authorities is that an applicant for leave is not required to demonstrate a prima facie case, in the technical sense of that term, against the company in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">What is required is evidence clearly establishing the existence of a serious claim and a real dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Another factor to which reference has been made in the authorities is whether the company was insured against the liability in respect of which the plaintiff is suing: Re Sydney Formworks at 651; Meehan at 127.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Insurance Policy
 Opes Prime Group Limited and a number of named subsidiaries were insured under a policy of insurance issued by QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited and which provided cover for the period from 4 August 2007 to 31 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The subsidiaries which were covered by the policy included OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The limit of indemnity under the policy is $10 million any one claim and $10 million in the aggregate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The insuring clause in the policy provides, relevantly:- 
 QBE agrees to indemnify the Insured against civil liability for compensation arising from any Claim first made against the Insured during the Period of Cover and notified to QBE during the Period of Cover as a result of a breach of professional duty in the conduct of the Financial Service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

 ...
 
 QBE agrees to pay Legal Expenses incurred with the written consent of QBE in the defence or settlement of any Claim indemnified by this Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

 "Claim" is defined in the policy as follows:- 
 Claim shall mean:
 
 (a) the receipt by the Insured of any written notice of demand for compensation made by a third party against the Insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">(b) Any writ, statement of claim, summons, application or other originating legal or arbitral process, cross-claim, counter claim or third or similar party notice served upon the Insured which contains a demand for compensation made by a third party against the Insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">

 The "Insured" is defined, relevantly, as the incorporated body stated in item 4.1 of the Schedule to the policy and any Subsidiary specified in item 4.2 of the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The insured named in item 4.1 of the schedule is Opes Prime Group Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">There is no item 4.2 in the Schedule but the certificate of currency issued by QBE lists seven subsidiaries which include OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Schedule to the policy describes the period of cover as being from 4 August 2007 to 31 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">"Financial Service" means the services provided by the Insured as specified in item 6 of the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The services listed in the Schedule are: 
 Practising as a stockbroker including but not limited to:
 purchases, sales and dealings in and subscriptions to securities including government and private stocks, shares, bonds, debentures, notes, deposits, rights and units; 
 ...
 investment of funds; provisions of advice relating to securities, finance ... 
...
 lending money and secuties; 
activities ancillary or related to the business of a stockbroker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">There are a large number of exclusions contained in section 4 of the Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I do not propose to set them out in my reasons as the insurer has not pointed to any particular exclusion upon which it relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Insurer's position
 I granted leave to the parties to file further evidence after the conclusion of oral argument to provide the Court with current information as to the status of OPSL's insurance cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">On 23 December, the insurer's solicitor wrote to the solicitor for the liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The following paragraphs of the letter are relevant:- Assuring a claim for indemnity is currently pressed, QBE reserves its rights under the Policy while it investigates OPSL's entitlement to indemnity for the Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">These investigations will include considering whether:
 
7.1 the Claim falls within the facts notified by OPSL during the Policy period (enabling OPSL to rely upon section 40(3) of the Insurance Contracts Act in circumstances where the Claim has been (or will be) made outside of the Policy period);
 
 
7.2 examining the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Claim to determine whether the Policy responds (including a consideration of relevant Exclusions in Section 4 of the Policy); and
 
 
7.3 considering whether OPSL has complied with its disclosure obligations (including the requirements of section 21 of the Insurance Contracts Act ) in entering into the contract of insurance with QBE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">...
 
 Under Section 5.1 of the Policy OPSL is obliged to frankly and honestly disclose to QBE all relevant information and provide all assistance as QBE shall require to investigate the Claim and to enable QBE to determine its liability under the Policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">While its investigations are ongoing QBE does not intend to exercise its right under Section 5.2 of the Policy to assume conduct of the Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Other proceedings against OPSL
 There are a large number of other proceedings on foot against OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">All of the proceedings appear to have been brought by former clients of OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The proceedings have been instituted in the Federal Court in the Victorian Registry, and in the Supreme Courts of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The proceedings are listed in [11] --- [12] of the affidavit of Mr J R Ludholm and in [8] of the affidavit of Ms T C Beltrane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">I do not propose to list the details of those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Leave to proceed against OPSL appears to has been given in the matters of Panopus PLC v Opes Prime StockBroking Limited (Receivers and Managers appointed) (Administrators appointed) (Supreme Court of Victoria proceeding 5835 of 2008); Asia Pacific Links Limited v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited &amp; Ors (Federal Court of Australia proceeding NSD 878 of 2008); and Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2009] FCA 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There are a number of other proceedings where leave has been sought but not yet granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The proceedings involve more than 100 claimants and include a number of class actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Client Creditors of OPSL
 As at 16 October 2008 the Liquidators calculated that there were 604 creditor accounts of former OPSL clients, and 213 debtor accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">There are 817 client accounts in total.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Liquidators' preliminary calculations indicate that the close-out position of the Client Creditor accounts (after netting off) are likely to result in the client creditors being owed approximately $300 million by OPSL at the date of liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Leave to join OPSL
 Notwithstanding the forceful submissions of Mr Strong, who appeared for the Liquidators, I have come to the view that the proper exercise of my discretion favours the grant of leave to proceed against OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In coming to this view, I have taken into account the factors referred to below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">First, I am satisfied that there is a serious claim and a real dispute within the test stated in Vagrand .</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is true, as Mr Strong submitted, that the claim against OPSL is, in a sense, "pre-emptive" because OPSL has not made a proprietary claim in respect of the securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Nevertheless, the claims arise out of the same factual matrix as those already made against Leveraged and Mr Emini and this of itself seems to me to be a significant factor in favour of the grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Although the factual matrix is not particularly complex, the claim turns in part upon the terms of conversations which may be disputed and there are questions of law which may be difficult to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Second, although the insurer has reserved its position, it is at least arguable that the policy responds to a claim for indemnity from OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">In my view, that is a sufficient basis for a grant of leave but I will reserve liberty to the Liquidators to apply to revoke the grant of leave if the insurer denies indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It is critical to the administration of the winding up of OPSL, and to the conduct of all the existing proceedings that the insurance position be determined as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The proceeds of the policy would be quarantined under the provisions of s 562 of the Corporations Act but the total of the available indemnity is limited to $10 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">This may have to be divided among a large number of claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This is a reason for the grant of leave because it will be conducive to the Court's supervision of the claims against OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Moreover, if Altinova were to be left to the proof of debt procedure in respect of the claim against OPSL, the insurance policy may not be engaged because a proof of debt would not fall within the definition of "claim" under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Third, I have taken into account the evidence which discloses that the Liquidators do not at present have funds to conduct a defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The short answer to this is that I have proceeded on the basis that it is sufficiently arguable that the insurer is obliged to provide indemnity to OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Also relevant to this factor is the existence of the other proceedings that are already on foot against OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Fourth, there is some force in the Liquidators' submission that many of the claims made by Altinova against OPSL can sound only in damages and that Altinova seeks to improve its position by agitating the claims as proprietary in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Mr Strong therefore submitted that the observations about the grant of leave to pursue proprietary claims made by Finkelstein J in Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 638 at [22] are distinguishable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Nevertheless, in my view the short answers to these submissions are the existence of the insurance policy and the relationship between the claims against OPSL and those already on foot against Leveraged and Mr Emini in this action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Fifth, I have taken into account the statement made to me by counsel for Mr Emini that it would be unsafe to proceed on the basis that his client will defend the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The position of Mr Emini is of course an important one because the relevant conversations are said to have taken place between Mr Seckold on behalf of Altinova and Mr Emini on behalf of Leveraged and OPSL But, at this stage, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Emini will not defend, apart from the caveat expressed by his counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It seems to me that in those circumstances I do not have a sufficient basis for making a positive determination that Mr Emini will not participate in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Sixth, it is true that no proprietary claim has been asserted by OPSL and that the Liquidators do not presently have funds to investigate such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">But this issue cannot be allowed to remain open indefinitely as a possible claim to be made by OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The submissions made by Mr Strong on this question are sufficiently met by reserving liberty to the Liquidators to apply to vary or revoke the grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">An order in those terms was made in Asia Pacific Links Limited v Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited &amp; Ors (Federal Court of Australia proceeding NSD 878 of 2008).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The grant of leave will of course be subject to the usual term that Altinova is not to enforce any judgment or order which it may obtain against OPSL without the further leave of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover, as in Ringfab , the terms on which leave is to be granted should release OPSL from any obligation to file proceedings, give discovery or otherwise participate in the litigation, pending further order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Leave to proceed against Leveraged
 There was no real issue in relation to the grant of leave to proceed against Leveraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">No doubt this was, at least in part, because the proceedings have already been commenced and have progressed to the stage that leave was granted to proceed against Leveraged when it was in voluntary administration and the proceedings are being defended by the Receivers who have filed a cross-claim against Altinova.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">See Ogilvie-Grant at 672.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Leave has already been granted by the Court to proceed against Green Frog which is in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It holds 2,180,000 shares in Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation which are the subject of Altinova's proprietary claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It is therefore appropriate that leave be granted to proceed against Leveraged so that the totality of the claims may be pursued and so that the grant of leave to proceed against Green Frog is not rendered nugatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is of course a significant factor in favour of the grant of leave that the Receivers of Leveraged have exercised their power under the charge to defend the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Moreover, the Receivers' cross-claim is still on foot and, if it is successful, Green Frog, as a party to the proceedings will be bound by a declaration that the securities held by Green Frog are beneficially owned by Leveraged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The real issue in relation to the grant of leave against Leveraged was whether it ought to be limited so as to exclude quantification of any damages that may be awarded to Altinova.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In my opinion the grant of leave should be so limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">There are two reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">First, s 554A of the Corporations Act provides that a liquidator must make an estimate of the value of a debt or claim or refer that question to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">This procedure would enable the Liquidators to value the claim and thereby avoid the necessity for the Court to assess the value separately in each of the cases that may be decided favourably to an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Second, excluding quantification of the claim from the grant of leave is more conducive to the Court's overall supervision of the administration because it may be that there will in due course be issues for determination that are common to these and other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Third, if Altinova is not successful on the issue of liability and the issue of whether it has suffered any recoverable loss, there will be no need for the parties to incur the expense of quantifying the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The Liquidators did not suggest that the grant of leave against OPSL be limited in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">However, the reasons given above would apply equally to the application to proceed against OPSL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Need for Rationalisation
 It seems to me that there is a pressing need for the parties to all the existing proceedings against OPSL to try to rationalise and perhaps co-ordinate their approach to the various actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Critical to their approach must be the Liquidators' estimate of any likely dividend payable out of the winding up and the question of the availability of the insurance cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The amount of any dividend is likely to turn upon the outcome of other litigation brought by the Liquidators against third parties, including in particular ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In my view, the parties to all the proceedings should try to arrange a joint mediation as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The insurer should be involved in the mediation; so too should ANZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Of course, my powers to order a mediation do not extend beyond this proceeding but I have no doubt that all of the relevant Courts would join in taking whatever steps are necessary to facilitate the making of all appropriate arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Two days ago, Finkelstein J handed down reasons for judgment in Phisci Pty Ltd v Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd (In liq) (No 3) [2009] FCA 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">His Honour granted leave to proceed against OPSL essentially upon the ground that the claim is to recover the applicant's own property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">His Honour limited the grant of leave to issues of liability only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The approach which I have taken is as in accordance with that followed by his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Orders
 I will make orders granting leave on terms which reflect my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
