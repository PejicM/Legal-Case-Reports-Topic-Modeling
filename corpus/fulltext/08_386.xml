 Introduction 
 
 1 On 26 February 2008 I ordered, pursuant to s 219(7)(b) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("the ASIC Act "), that Mr Albarran be punished in the same manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of Court, for his refusal or failure to answer 37 questions that were put to him by the Panel Chairman of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 I have now heard submissions as to the punishment to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Counsel for ASIC submitted that the circumstances of this case call for the imposition of a substantial fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">ASIC also seeks an order that Mr Albarran pay its costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Unless otherwise indicated, all paragraph references in these reasons refer to my decision in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Albarran [2008] FCA 147.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The contempt power and the punishment options 
 
4 Section 219(7) of the ASIC Act confers power on the Court to punish, as on contempt, a person who fails to attend before the Board, or who fails to answer a question when required to do so by the Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 As a statutory analogue for the exercise of the power to punish for contempt, no question arises under s 219(7) as to the Court's power of punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In any event, the Court's power to punish for contempt is well-established: Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 at [74] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 In Siminton , a Full Court observed at [74] that where a natural person is the contemnor, the Court has power to impose a fine, order that the person be committed to serve a term of imprisonment, or to order both a fine and imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The statutory sources of the power are s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and rule 11.04 of the High Court Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">7 The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is no longer of any practical significance: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Nevertheless, a number of relevant principles are to be found in their Honours' analysis of the distinction that was previously thought to underlie the difference between the civil and criminal species of contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 First, disobedience to a court order or breach of an undertaking to a court amounts to a criminal contempt if it involves deliberate defiance or is contumacious: Witham v Holloway at 530.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">A contempt which is characterised in this way is therefore at the more serious end of the spectrum, although any contempt is a serious matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">9 Second, proceedings for breach of an order or undertaking have the effect of vindicating judicial authority, and a remedial or coercive effect: Witham v Holloway at 533.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">10 Third, as was earlier observed by the High Court in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Proprietary Limited ("Mudginberri") [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108, the punitive and remedial objects of the exercise of the contempt power are inextricably intertwined: Witham v Holloway at 533-534.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">11 In Mudginberri their Honours referred to the "strong stream" of authority for the proposition that a fine may be imposed when the contempt consists of wilful disobedience of a court order, at least in the sense that the disobedience is not "casual, accidental or unintentional": 106-107, 109, 112-113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">12 Reference was also made in Mudginberri to the underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power, namely the need to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Their Honours quoted from the then current edition of the seminal work on the law of contempt, Borrie &amp; Lowe's Law of Contempt (2 nd ed, 1983): if a court lacked the means to enforce its orders, or if its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">13 In Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 ; (1999) 99 ATC 5124 at [35] , Carr J said:
 
 Any contempt of court is serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The seriousness transcends matters such as the personal dignity of the judiciary, or the rights in this case of the Commissioner as a litigant in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The offence involves interference with the effective administration of justice, by impeding and perverting its course: Johnson v Grant (1923) SC 789 at 790 per Lord President Clyde.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Contempt of court is a matter of basic and public significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Unless the laws of contempt are properly enforced our whole system of justice is at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 

14 In BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] FCA 336 , Kiefel J said at [3]:
 
 Penalties for contempt of Court orders necessarily recognise that the Court's authority must be vindicated, and that there is a public interest in compliance with all orders of the Court: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 , 533 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Orders for penalties recognise the need to deter not only the defaulting party, but others who might be like-minded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 

15 The statutory scheme which underlies the conferral of power on the Court under 
s 219(7)(b) recognises that it is through the exercise of judicial power under Ch III of the Constitution that the authority of the Board is to be vindicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">16 The Board is furnished with a very significant disciplinary and regulatory function in the exercise of its power under s 1292 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to cancel or suspend the registration of an auditor or liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">17 In aid of its disciplinary function the Board is given power in s 219 of the ASIC Act to summons witnesses and to require them to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">18 As Emmett J remarked, in a different statutory context, in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Pappas [2007] FCA 672 at [23] , the power to examine witnesses is a significant one which is conferred in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">His Honour continued:
 
 Members of the public should understand that failure to comply with orders of the Court requiring compliance with the Commission's requirements in connection with investigation will not be treated lightly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 

19 In my view, his Honour's remarks are equally applicable to the failure to comply with the Board's requirements, in the exercise of powers that are conferred on it in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">20 It follows from these authorities, and from the statutory regime to which I referred at [13] --- [21] of my principal judgment, that an appropriate penalty would be one which signifies to Mr Albarran and to the public, that failure to comply with the obligation to answer the Board's questions will be treated no less seriously than it would in the exercise of similar functions by a Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The factors relevant to determination of an appropriate penalty 
 
21 In Anderson v Hassett (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 1444 at [6] , Brereton J listed ten factors which are now commonly considered by judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in determining the proper punishment for contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">22 Eight of those factors were listed by Emmett J in Pappas at [2] as relevant to the question of determination of penalty in the case of failure to assist ASIC in connection with an investigation under s 19 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">23 I adopt the factors listed by Brereton J in Anderson , and accepted by Emmett J in Pappas , as guiding principles for the determination of the appropriate penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The tenth factor referred to by Brereton J, namely denunciation of the contempt, was not included in Emmett J's list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">However, in my opinion it is a factor to be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">24 A number of those factors point to the imposition of a substantial punishment on Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In particular, his contempt was serious, he was aware of the consequences and he has not apologised to the Court or the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">25 I will deal with these factors, and the presence of any mitigating factors in considering the circumstances of the case which are relevant to the question of punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The circumstances of the case relevant to the question of punishment 
 
26 The findings which I made in my principal judgment establish, quite clearly, that Mr Albarran's refusal to answer the Panel Chairman's questions was wilful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">27 It is not to the point that Mr Albarran indicated a willingness to re-appear before the Panel after his AAT hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">He was summonsed to appear before the Panel in the Partner's matter on 7 February 2007 and declined to answer questions that were put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">His refusal constituted deliberate and stubborn defiance of the Panel, notwithstanding the failure of his application to be excused from attendance and the absence of any prejudice to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">28 Mr Albarran's failure or refusal to answer questions that were relevant to the disciplinary proceeding in the Partner's matter was a deliberate and stubborn defiance of the Panel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The contempt was contumacious in the sense referred to in the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">29 It is perhaps unnecessary to repeat the findings I made in my principal judgment which establish the contumacious nature of the contempt but I will do so briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">30 A chronological account of the events from November 2006 to January 2007 shows that Mr Albarran, initially on the advice of solicitors and counsel, contended that the summons to give evidence was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">But despite the assurance given in ASIC's letter of 14 December 2006 that it merely sought to adduce the same evidence he had already given, Mr Albarran persisted in his application to be excused: see in particular [38], [39], [42], [47], [48], [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">31 Mr Magarey's detailed ruling of 25 January 2007 made it plain that Mr Albarran had no basis for a refusal to answer questions which sought to adduce evidence that Mr Albarran had previously given in his own disciplinary proceeding: see in particular [60] and [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">32 I accepted at [120] that it is likely that Mr Albarran did not read Mr Magarey's ruling but this is a further aspect of his deliberate defiance of the authority of the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">His attitude, as I said at [143], is graphically revealed by what was recorded in the file note of 25 January 2007, "they can take me to the Federal Court": see [64].</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">33 Mr Albarran's defiance is further revealed in what he said to the Panel Chairman on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I have set out the whole of the relevant exchange at [69].</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It is pertinent to note that when told by the Chairman that his appearance would be virtually useless, Mr Albarran replied that the Partner who was the subject of the proceedings before the Board "wasn't required at my hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I can't see such a big issue about me being required ..."
 
34 Mr Albarran persisted in his refusal when told by the Chairman that his attitude negatived Mr Magarey's ruling "so we can't allow that to happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">" He continued to defy the Panel Chairman even after counsel assisting the Panel pointed out that there could not be any prejudice in being asked to give the same evidence he had given previously: see [74], [75].</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">35 That Mr Albarran was aware of the consequences of the contempt is revealed in the file note of 25 January 2007, to which I have referred, and even more graphically in that part of the file note of 17 January 2007 set out at [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Mr Albarran was aware from this that failure to answer questions without reasonable excuse was a criminal offence for which he could be imprisoned: see [143].</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">36 To this must be added my finding at [132] that Mr Albarran was prepared to run the risk of the consequences that would flow from his failure to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">37 Senior counsel for Mr Albarran, Mr Byrne SC, put a number of well-directed submissions to me on the question of mitigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">38 I accept that there was no direct personal benefit to Mr Albarran from his refusal to answer the questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I made no finding as to the reason or motive for the contempt, but it is probably to be gleaned from Mr Albarran's remarks in the exchange with the Panel Chairman which I referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Albarran continued by saying:
 
 To me, it seems that ASIC want to have a go at me before they get to my appeal ... (see at [69]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">

39 Mr Albarran's reason or motive may also be revealed in his misguided attempt to explain his prejudice in the passage at [142].</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">That is, he said he may have answered some questions differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">40 In short, I do not consider the absence of any direct personal benefit to be a relevant mitigating factor in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">41 Nor do I consider it relevant as a mitigating factor that the refusal to answer was in the Partner's disciplinary proceeding, rather than Mr Albarran's own matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">This is because 
 s 219 of the ASIC Act is concerned solely with the compellability of witnesses in disciplinary proceedings before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The factor relied upon by Mr Byrne is therefore a fact which, subject to the issue of a certificate under s 219(6) , enlivened the jurisdiction of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Accordingly, it cannot be a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">42 It is true that Mr Albarran's refusal to answer the questions did not prevent the Panel from completing its hearing, or from carrying out its function of disciplining the Partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">This is not an answer to Mr Albarran's contempt, but it carries a small amount of weight in mitigating the seriousness of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">43 Apart from what is said in three character references, all that is relevantly known of the defendant's antecedents is that in 2005 the Board made a finding that Mr Albarran participated in contrived nominee arrangements for the appointment of administrators of Formula Engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Board did not find that Mr Albarran acted dishonestly: [33] --- [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">44 I accept, as was stated in the references, that the effect of the disciplinary ruling has been very severe for Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I accept that he was previously of good standing professionally and that he enjoyed considerable professional success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">But the consequences which flowed from the disciplinary proceeding, including the stress and personal turmoil are not related to the contempt proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">45 I do not accept that the stress and turmoil in Mr Albarran's personal life explain his failure or refusal to answer the Panel Chairman's questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However, I consider that some weight should be given to the fact that the present matter, and my findings in it, will inevitably receive publicity within the accounting profession, especially among insolvency practitioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This constitutes a form of punishment which will have a specific and general deterrent effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">46 Whilst I accept that Mr Albarran has informed the persons who provided character references of his regret for his decision to refuse to answer the questions, I do not consider that this demonstrates genuine contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The short answer to Mr Byrne's submission on this factor is that Mr Albarran has not expressed contrition to the Board or to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">47 The lack of contrition is especially relevant in light of my rejection of critical aspects of Mr Albarran's evidence as untruthful (see at [105]) and my finding that Mr Albarran's state of mind after Mr Magarey's ruling was "entirely unreasonable" (at [136]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">48 In my view, the factors in this case show that a substantial fine is required to vindicate the authority of the Board and to serve the requirements of personal and general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">I accept that a term of imprisonment is inappropriate, that being a punishment of last resort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Level of fine 
 
49 I have considered the helpful bundle of authorities given to me by counsel for ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">However, ultimately the authorities provide only the most general guidance because each case turns on different factual considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">50 This is not a case in which I am asked to take into account the defendant's limited financial circumstances: cf Pappas at [24]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Wynhoven (2004) 51 ACSR 384 at [10] per Selway J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Here, there is no evidence as to Mr Albarran's financial circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Accordingly, this factor can neither increase nor reduce the penalty: Four Seasons Gutter Protection Pty Limited v Leafbusters Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 1402 at [18] per Heerey J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">51 For reasons mentioned below, I will make an order for indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">This is said to be a mitigating factor: Four Seasons Gutter Protection at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">But it does not follow that there ought to be a mechanical process under which the level of fine is reduced to reflect the difference between indemnity costs and party and party costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">52 Taking into account all of the factors mentioned above, in particular the seriousness of Mr Albarran's contempt, his knowledge of the consequences and his failure to show contrition, I consider that I ought to impose a fine of $20,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Indemnity Costs 
 
53 In BHP Steel , Kiefel J observed at [22] that persons who prosecute contempt cases are often recognised as performing a public duty and an order for indemnity costs is made so that they are not out of pocket in taking that role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">54 The authorities which record the history of the practice of ordering solicitor/client costs in contempt proceedings are set out by Gillard J in National Australia Bank Ltd v Juric 
 (No 2) [2001] VSC 398 at [67] --- [68].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">55 Gillard J ordered costs on a solicitor and own client basis rather than indemnity costs but those two bases are "more or less equated": EMI Records Ltd v Ian Cameron Wallace Ltd [1982] 2 All ER 980 at 984, 989; Tetijo Holdings Pty Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (FCA, French J, 3 May 1991, unreported) at 5-6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">56 As Sir Robert Megarry VC said in EMI Records at 984, indemnity costs are commonly ordered in contempt cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The same practice is adopted in Australia, for reasons which include those stated by Kiefel J in BHP Steel .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">I therefore propose to order Mr Albarran to pay the costs of the proceeding (including the costs incurred prior to the substitution of ASIC as plaintiff) on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
