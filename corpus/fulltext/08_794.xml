<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant, the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation, petitions for a sequestration order under s 43 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act ") in respect of the estate of the respondent, Mr Brian Cumins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The amended petition pleads that the respondent owes the applicant $38,032,100.01.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The alleged act of bankruptcy relied upon is the failure, by the respondent, amongst other things, to comply, on or before 18 September 2006, with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice deemed served on him on 4 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The bankruptcy notice was issued on 17 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">BACKGROUND 
 
2 The respondent, Mr Cumins, invested in excess of $5 million in what he described as "Infomercial Schemes" between 1996 and 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">An "Infomercial", according to the respondent, is an advertising film which is generally shown on television and promotes a product in an informative and objective style.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 On 23 October 2000, the applicant issued Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows:
 
 
 Year Ended Amount 
 1996 $ 3,344,884.24
 1997 $ 2,836,956.98
 1998 $12,954,263.05
 TOTAL $19,136,104.27 
 

4 Those assessments were related to tax deductions claimed by the respondent in connection with his investments in the Infomercial Schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Those tax deductions were disallowed by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 On 23 November 2000 the applicant issued further Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows: 
 
 
 Year Amount 
 1995 $ 243,360.31
 1996 $ 123,141.55
 1998 $2,619,580.49
 TOTAL $2,986,082.35 
 

6 In February 2001 the applicant filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to recover from the respondent the amounts of both the October and November 2000 assessments as well as interest and other charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">7 On 3 August 2001 the respondent commenced review proceedings in the AAT in respect of each of the applicant's decisions to disallow the respondent's objections to the assessments issued on 23 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In February 2005 the respondent withdrew the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Pursuant to s 42(A)1B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) the affect of the withdrawal was that the AAT proceedings were considered to have been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Infomercial Management Group Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 262 at [58] the Supreme Court of Victoria held that certain Infomercial schemes were a fraud on the investors, if not on the Australian Taxation Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">These schemes, so claims the respondent, were the ones in which he had invested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">9 Importantly, other than in relation to a very small sum comprised in the 1998 assessment, none of the November 2000 assessments concerned the respondent's investments in the Infomercial Schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The assessment for 1998 for $2,619,580.49 was subject to objections by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These objections failed, as did a subsequent review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In February 2005 an appeal to this Court from the decision of the AAT was dismissed by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The November 2000 assessments for 1995 and 1996 have never been the subject of an application for review or legal challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">10 On 15 June 2005 the applicant obtained summary judgment in the Supreme Court of Western Australia against the respondent for the sum of $38,084,522.24, including interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The respondent did not consent to the judgment but did not oppose it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">11 On 17 March 2006 the Deputy Commissioner issued a bankruptcy notice which was deemed served on the respondent on 4 August 2006 requiring payment, within 21 days after service, in the amount of $38,051,066.24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The amount demanded comprised the sum of the judgment less an amount of $33,456 described in the bankruptcy notice as "payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The bankruptcy notice was in the form prescribed: Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth), reg 4.02, Form 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Schedule set out the amount claimed by the applicant to be due as follows:
 SCHEDULE 
 
 
 Column 1 Column 2 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Amount of judgments or order $38,084,522.24 plus 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1, below) $0.00 plus 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2, below) $0.00 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Subtotal $38,084,522.24 less 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders $33,456.00 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Total debt owing $38,051,066.24 

 
12 The respondent has failed to comply with the bankruptcy notice or to satisfy otherwise the provisions contained in s 40(1)(g) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 The amount of $33,456 at item 5 of the Schedule comprises:
 
 
 &#8226; $9,516 on 30 August 2005 as a result of a notice of assessment issued to Mr Cumins for the year ended 30 June 2004;
 &#8226; $7,140 on 30 August 2005 as a result of a notice of assessment issued to Mr Cumins for the year ended 30 June 2003; and 
 &#8226; $16,800 by way of 16 garnishee payments of $1050 from the respondent's employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 

14 On 23 August 2006 the respondent filed an application in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an extension of time to set aside the judgment on the basis that he was defrauded by the promoters of a tax avoidance scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In February 2007, the respondent's application was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The respondent filed an application for review by the Court of Appeal, which was ultimately dismissed: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] WASCA 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">15 The respondent also failed in proceedings in this Court by which he had sought to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">This culminated in the dismissal of his appeal to the Full Court in December 2007: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">16 On 12 November 2007 the respondent's solicitors wrote to the AAT requesting it to reinstate the AAT proceedings abandoned by the respondent in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This was shortly after the Court of Appeal dismissed the respondent's appeal against the decision refusing an extension of time within which to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Tribunal has yet to make a decision whether to reinstate the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The applicant has opposed the application for reinstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">17 Since then the respondent has filed a further application in the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The application is to extend time for lodging an application for review of a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It concerns the sum of $9,375 which forms a part of the respondent's taxable income for the year ended 30 June 1998 and which was the subject of the amended tax assessment issued on 23 November 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is yet to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">VALIDITY OF BANKRUPTCY NOTICE 
 
18 The petition is opposed on grounds that the bankruptcy notice which underpins the petition is invalid because it overstates the amount in fact due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The respondent asserts that there is an understatement in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice of payments made and/or credits to which he is entitled relating to the period between the date of the judgment and the date of issue of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">19 The alleged misstatements, by reason of missed credits and payments in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice, originally fell into the following four categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The third and fourth of these were the subject of an earlier decision in this matter: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 4] [2008] FCA 558.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">They are not pressed by the respondent, leaving only the first two categories for consideration: 
 
 
 (a) PAYG payments totalling $9,516 received on behalf of the respondent by the applicant effectively on 14 August 2005; 
 
 (b) general interest charge credits arising from garnishee payments totalling $7,350 made by the respondent before the date of judgment but not credited to his account until after the date of judgment, resulting in an unquantified overcharge of general interest charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The overcharge relates to the periods from the respective dates of receipt, as contended for by the respondent, to the judgment date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The applicant did not claim interest in the bankruptcy notice for the post-judgment period;
 
 (c) missed credits amounting to $31,007.72; and
 
 (d) a rounding credit of four cents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 PAYG Payments 
 
20 PAYG payments were made on the respondent's behalf by his employer for the 2005 tax year as follows: 

 PAYG Period Date Received by the ATO Amount of PAYG Paid ($) July 2004 23/08/2004 793 August 2004 21/09/2004 793 September 2004 27/10/2004 793 October 2004 22/11/2004 793 November 2004 17/12/2004 793 December 2004 28/02/2005 793 January 2005 16/02/2005 793 February 2005 21/03/2005 793 March 2005 21/04/2005 793 April 2005 20/05/2005 793 May 2005 20/06/2005 793 June 2005 20/07/2005 793 
 
 9,516 

 
21 However, it was not until the respondent's group certificate was lodged by his employer with the applicant on 14 August 2005, that the applicant was able to identify that the above PAYG instalments had been received on behalf of the respondent: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1847 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The respondent submits accordingly that the effective date of payment of $9,516 on his behalf was 14 August 2005 and that this amount relating to the 2005 tax year should have been included in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice, as "payments made".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">22 The last two payments were received after the date of the judgment and before the issue of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">General Interest Charge Credits 
 
23 The general interest charge credits, said to have been omitted from item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice, related to seven garnishee payments totalling $7,350 for each of the months November 2004 to May 2005 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Each garnishee payment was in the amount of $1,050 and was said to have been mailed by the respondent's employer about the beginning of each month from December 2004 to June 2005 inclusive, to the applicant to an address - GPO Box 4596SS Melbourne Vic 3000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Each payment, the respondent submits, was, by virtue of s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), deemed to have been received on the fourth working day after posting and thereby, in each case to have been received by the applicant for the purposes of s 8AAZM of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">However, the applicant says that the amount of these seven payments, totalling $7,350 was not received until 22 September 2005 and was then credited to the respondent's account on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">24 It follows, the respondent submits, that the failure to account for the payments at the time each was received by the applicant, according to the respondent, led to an overstatement of general interest charges in respect of which a "credit" should have been "allowed" in item 5 of the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The respondent has not quantified the amount of the interest said to have been overcharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">25 It follows, submits the respondent, that the amount of the "debt owing" in the Schedule was overstated, at least, by the amount of $9,516 and the amount of the general interest charge credit to which he says he was then entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Section 41(5) of the Act 
 
26 Threshold questions arise as to whether s 41(5) of the Act has application to the bankruptcy notice and, if so, whether notice under that section has been given by the respondent to the applicant in respect of the alleged misstatements in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">27 Section 41(5) provides:
 A bankruptcy notice is not invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due, unless the debtor, within the time allowed for payment, gives notice to the creditor that he or she disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of the misstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">28 The respondent submits that:
 
 
 (a) No s 41(5) notice was required concerning the misstatements in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">(b) Alternatively, notice was given by means of par [36] of an affidavit of Mr Cumins sworn on 14 August 2006 and which is wide enough to cover all the missed credits and payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">(c) Alternatively, the par [36] notice is wide enough to cover at least the PAYG payments and the garnishee payments which give rise to the overcharge of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 Was a section 41(5) notice required?</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 
29 The respondent relies upon the decision in St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla [2000] FCA 1094 ; (2000) 181 ALR 682 in which Heerey J concluded that no notice under s 41(5) was required to be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The bankruptcy notice in that case was identified as being defective in two respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">First, credits and payments totalling approximately $1.4 million had been omitted from item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Second, the total amount due exceeded the amount in fact due to the extent of the omitted credits and payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It was held that the defect in the bankruptcy notice was not " only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There was another, albeit related, defect, namely, the omitted credits and payments under item 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">30 In Robert Hudson (Junior) v Thomas James Donald [1997] FCA 852 , decided before St George , Lindgren J also considered the application of s 41(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The case concerned a bankruptcy notice, the form of which, as in this case, was that set out in Form 1, Schedule 1, prescribed under the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth), reg 4.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">31 His Honour said:
 How do subs 41(5) and subs (6) apply to the new form?</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Clearly, the expression in subs 41(5) 'the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor' is apt to refer at least to the amount shown as 'Total debt owing'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Does it also refer to the component parts of that amount, in particular, 'Amount of judgment or order'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Although the contrary is arguable, I think that it does, at least in a case such as the present, where the overstatement in the 'Total debt owing' is no more than a reflection of an overstatement in one of those elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Except in a case of an arithmetical error of addition, an overstatement of the 'Total debt owing' will always predicate an error in one or more of the component elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">To confine the operation of the subsections to a case where there is an overstatement only of the 'Total debt owing' due to an arithmetical error of addition would be too narrow a construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Where, as here, the overstatement of the amount of the 'Total debt owing' is attributable to an overstatement in the amount of one or more components in the Schedule, the excessive specification of 'the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor' to which subs 41(5) refers, extends to embrace the corresponding and causative excessive specification in the Schedule of an amount or amounts of the latter kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">32 An appeal from that decision was dismissed: Robert Hudson (Junior) v Thomas James Donald [1998] FCA 227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">33 I respectfully consider that the wider construction in Robert Hudson Jnr is to be preferred to the narrow construction in St George .</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It would appear that the decision in Robert Hudson Jnr was not brought to the attention of the Court in St George , nor does it appear from his Honour's reasons that there was full argument on the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Accordingly, I would respectfully adopt the reasoning on this point in Robert Hudson Jnr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In doing so, I am conscious that St George was followed by the Federal Magistrates Court in SGRO v Liberty Funding Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 625.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Once again, however, Robert Hudson Jnr was not cited by the parties or considered by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Furthermore, s 41(5), in contrast to s 306, is not expressed in terms of the existence of a "defect" in a bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Rather, it concerns whether the amount specified in the bankruptcy notice as due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Inevitably any overstatement will broadly be for one or two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">First, there is an error or errors in one or more of items 1-5 set out in column 2 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Then, when items 1-5 are added up they produce an excessive total at item 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Second, there is an arithmetical error in adding up items 1-5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Of course there could be errors of both kinds occurring in the one notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The intent of s 41(5) is, in my opinion, to consider the question of whether the amount stated is excessive as well as why that is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">This approach to its construction is consistent with the observations of the Full Court in Seovic at [36] to which I have referred concerning the need for the debtor, when giving notice under s 41(5), to provide sufficient information to enable the creditor to identify the nature of the misstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I apprehend that this was intended to mean that information needs to be provided disclosing not just that the amount stated as due is excessive but the reason(s) why that is said to be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">34 The question of the excessive amount requires then a composite analysis of the overstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It is not apt to characterise the composite parts as discrete "defects".</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Did the affidavit of Cumins contain a notice under section 41(5)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 
35 Paragraph [36] of an affidavit sworn by the respondent on 14 August 2006 states:
 The Bankruptcy Notice is for an amount of $38,051,066.24 after a credit for an amount of $33,456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I verily believe that the credited amount may be the result of an amendment to a tax assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In addition during the period of May 2005 to 14 March 2006 I have paid to the Respondent an amount of $10,500 which I verily believe may not have been credited against the amount of the Judgment debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Therefore I verily believe that the Bankruptcy Notice exceeds the amount of the Judgment debt due and payable relied upon for the Bankruptcy Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">36 The affidavit was filed in support of the respondent's earlier application to set aside the bankruptcy notice which was dismissed both at first instance and on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">37 The respondent submits that this paragraph constitutes notice for the purposes of s 41(5) and is wide enough to cover all of the missed credits and payments; alternatively, it is wide enough to cover at least the alleged misstatements related to the PAYG payments and garnishee payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I am satisfied that notice for the purposes of s 41(5) could be given by means of an affidavit served on a creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The section is silent as to the method of giving notice and it is not necessary in giving notice to expressly refer to s 41(5): Hussain v King Investment Solutions [2006] FCA 905 ; (2006) 153 FCR 428 at [19] - [20] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">38 Such notice must, by virtue of s 41(5), be given by the debtor within the time allowed for payment under the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The bankruptcy notice was deemed to have been served on the respondent on 4 August 2006 pursuant to orders made by Registrar Gilich on 14 July 2006 in the matter of PEG 177 of 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It was then amended on 19 July 2006 by a delegate of the Official Receiver such that the respondent was required to comply with the terms of the notice within 21 days after 4 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The affidavit was served on the Commissioner on 14 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Accordingly, notice was given within the time allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">39 However, in my opinion it does not constitute notice which is wide enough to cover the asserted misstatements in the bankruptcy notice as a whole or alternatively the two related to the PAYG and garnishee payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">40 The Full Court in Seovic Civil Engineering Pty Ltd v Groeneveld [1999] FCA 255 ; (1999) 87 FCR 120 in obiter set out what, in principle, is required to constitute notice of a "misstatement" for the purposes of s 41(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In so doing it considered but doubted the correctness of both Re Charles Murray (1959) 18 ABC 152 at 156 upon which the respondent here relies, as well as Re Wilhemsen; Ex parte Gould (1986) 11 FCR 107 at 108.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It said at [36]:
 The expression 'the misstatement' strongly suggests that the debtor must do more than merely assert that there is a misstatement in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The subsection requires the debtor to provide sufficient information in the notice to enable a creditor to identify what is said to be the alleged misstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Only then does the debtor's notice displace the general rule established by s 41(5), that the bankruptcy notice is not invalidated only by reason that the sum specified therein as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">(emphasis in original) 
The Court continued: 
 The point of the notice is to draw to the creditor's attention the misstatement, thereby giving the creditor the opportunity to consider, for example, whether the bankruptcy notice should be withdrawn and a fresh notice, correcting the misstatement, issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">If the creditor is given no hint in the notice as to the nature of the misstatement, there is a considerable risk that the debtor will be able to take unmeritorious advantage of minor errors (such as the small mistake in the present case) and that unnecessary and wasteful litigation will eventuate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is no answer to say that the creditor can ask for particulars, since the debtor would not be obliged to give any until after litigation had been instituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Indeed, a debtor wishing to take advantage of the technicalities of the law of bankruptcy might be well-advised to say as little as possible for as long as possible about the true nature of the alleged misstatement in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The requirement for some specificity did not, the Full Court considered, extend to require the identification of the misstatement with "complete precision" or that the debtor "specify the exact amount of the alleged excess".</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">A debtor's notice should be given a "benevolent construction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">41 I respectfully agree with these observations made by the Full Court and adopt them here as apt to the proper construction of s 41(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">42 The respondent and his solicitor, Mr Kevin Dundo, each swore affidavits on 29 April 2008 to the effect that the word "Judgment" in the last sentence of para [36] was placed there in error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The respondent submits that, in any event, that error, on a fair reading, is obvious as a matter of construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">For present purposes I will proceed on the assumption, without deciding the construction question that the last sentence should be read in the way the respondent contends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The written evidence as to the error made would not, in my opinion, affect the objective meaning at the time the affidavit was provided to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">43 The respondent submits that this sentence, read in that way, is sufficient to cover all four grounds of asserted misstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Re Charles Murray would support this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I have, however, declined to follow that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">44 Applying even the most benevolent constitution to the last sentence in para [36], I do not consider that it provides sufficient information to enable the applicant to identify the asserted misstatements presently relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">So far as concerns the alleged misstatements said to arise by reason of missed credits amounting to $31,007.72 as well as rounding credit of four cents I repeat what I said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 4] , particularly at [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">45 The respondent then submits that para [36], taken as a whole, is sufficient to embrace the misstatements related to the PAYG and garnishee payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">He says that he was at a "severe informational disadvantage" during the period when a s 41(5) notice had to be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I take this to mean, at least, that during the period in which notice was required to be given he did not have a copy of the taxation account maintained in respect to him by the applicant showing amounts received from him or on his behalf from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">A copy of this document was before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It is discovered document No 1 in Part 1 of Schedule 1 in the applicant's list of documents made pursuant to orders 1 and 2 of District Registrar Jan made on 29 January 2008 filed on the 6 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It is described as the "Original income tax account history for Brian Cumins showing transactions and interest for the period 05.01.99 to 25.01.08" and is dated 31.01.08.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">46 If the respondent had had a copy of this document during the period in which notice under s 41(5) might have been given by him to the applicant, he would have seen, for example, that, contrary to his understanding, the seven alleged garnishee payments of $1,050 each had not been recorded as received by the applicant in each month from December 2004 to June 2005 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Further, in relation to the $9,516 PAYG payments he would have seen that this amount in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2005 was not credited to his account until 21 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">This too would have been contrary to his understanding that it should have been credited to his taxation account in the period between the date of judgment and the date of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He would have had sufficient information to give notice under s 41(5) in respect to both of those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">47 In this context the respondent submits that where a government body is involved and has the benefit of a statutory regime, the s 41(5) notice requirements should not be interpreted strictly or narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There is, in my opinion, no basis to this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">There is only one proper construction of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">What will constitute sufficient notice will vary from one case to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">If a debtor does not have the necessary information to enable notice to be given under s 41(5) and could not have obtained it by reasonable endeavours, then this may well form a basis for seeking an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) for giving notice when that information, by whatever means, comes into the hands of the debtor: cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 4] [2008] FCA 558 at [20] - [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I decided there that the respondent could, merely by making a request, have obtained a copy of his taxation account from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I would not revise that conclusion even after considering the content of paras [5]-[19] of the affidavit of Mr Kevin Dundo sworn on 29 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I do not accept that the respondent was at any disadvantage in this respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">If he was, it was occasioned by his own inaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">48 The respondent points to the fact that the sum of $10,500 mentioned in para [36] is a multiple of $1,050 which was the amount garnisheed on a monthly basis in the hands of the respondent's employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">This, he submits, should have alerted the applicant to look closely at payments received and credits allowed in respect of the period after judgment and before the bankruptcy notice issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">I do not accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The onus is upon the respondent to sufficiently articulate the misstatements upon which it relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">49 Even if para [36] were thought to have put the applicant on such a train of enquiry, it would have been unproductive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">First, the period mentioned in para [36] concerning payments of $10,500 is said to be between May 2005 to 14 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">However, what is now complained about concerns seven payments of $1,050 totalling $7,350 alleged to have been made between December 2004 to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">This involves an overlap of but two months across a combined period of 15 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Second, according to the applicant's records, the amount of $7,350 was received together with one other payment of $1,050, a total of $8,400, on 22 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This amount was included in the figure set out under item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Paragraph [36] states that the $10,500 was paid to the applicant between May 2005 and 14 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Obviously 22 September falls between those two dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The applicant did direct its attention to garnishee payments made by the respondent for the purposes of the bankruptcy notice and gave a credit in item 5 for $16,800, which amount includes the $7,350.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The $16,800 comprises the following garnishee payments made according to the applicant's records, between the date of the judgment and the date of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Amount Date received $1,050.00 22 August 2005 $1,050.00 31 August 2005 $8,400.00 22 September 2005 $1,050.00 30 September 2005 $1,050.00 3 November 2005 $1,050.00 5 December 2005 $1,050.00 5 January 2006 $1,050.00 6 February 2006 $1,050.00 7 March 2006 $16,800.00 
 

 
50 The amount of $16,800 is included in the amount of $33,456 contained at item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">That figure also includes two other amounts according to an affidavit sworn by Nola Kathryn Rice, a public service employee with the ATO: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 207 at [10] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The respondent acknowledges this in his affidavit sworn 6 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The amounts are set out under para [13] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">There was no reason, in my view, for the applicant to think that para [36] was directed to an overcharge of general interest charges related to seven of the garnishee payments totalling $7,350 allegedly made prior to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">51 Further, in my opinion, nothing in para [36] would have alerted the applicant to the matter of the PAYG payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">52 In any event, the applicant's considered view was that the PAYG payments of $9,516 in respect of the 2005 tax year did not give rise to any entitlement in the respondent to have that amount included in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">That view was vindicated by Siopis J at first instance: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 1847 and on appeal: Cumins v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FACFA 207 in proceedings in which the respondent sought to have the bankruptcy notice set aside for this very reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">53 The respondent's further and better particulars of its grounds of opposition assert, in effect, that he did not have, at the times of the hearings at first instance and on appeal, the evidence disclosing the details of the PAYG payments made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">This is of no consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Both cases dealt with the total amount of $9,516.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">It matters not, in the result, that some payments were received before, and some after, the judgment date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">54 The respondent submits that on this point the decision in Pedikaris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [No 2] [2007] FCA 2087 should be followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Particular reliance is placed on para [99].</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">At that paragraph, Graham J was considering the relevance of PAYG payments in the context of recovery proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Furthermore, his Honour, at paras [92]-[93], made findings on the issue of when the Commissioner was obliged to give credits for PAYG payments which are entirely consistent with the concurrent findings of Siopis J and the Full Court to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Bankruptcy notice did not overstate amount due 
 
55 If I am wrong about the reach of para [36] and it is sufficient to embrace the alleged misstatements relied upon, I, nonetheless, am not persuaded that there were such misstatements in the bankruptcy notice as asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">As to the $9,516 PAYG payments, the respondent submits that an issue estoppel does not arise between these parties in the petition proceedings by reason of the matters decided by Siopis J and the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It is unnecessary to decide that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">I have considered both cases and respectfully am in agreement with the reasons and conclusions of Siopis J, particularly at [11] where his Honour said:
 I reject the applicant's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In my view, the question of when the credit in respect of the PAYG deductions accrued to the applicant is to be assessed by reference to s 18---15(1) of Sch 1 of the TAA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">There is no reason not to give effect to that statutory provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It follows that the applicant only became entitled to the credit once the assessment was made for the tax year in respect of which the PAYG deductions were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In those circumstances, I find that at the time of the issue of the bankruptcy notice on 17 March 2006, the sum of $9516 did not comprise an amount in respect of which a deduction should have been recorded in the bankruptcy notice, as either a payment made or a credit due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The bankruptcy notice did not, therefore, overstate the amount due and was not invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">I decline to set it aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">56 There was no challenge to this particular finding on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Nonetheless, the Full Court at [39] noted its agreement with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">57 The respondent further submits that the proper characterisation of the PAYG instalments in issue for the purposes of item 5 of the bankruptcy notice is as "payments made".</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">This, he says, avoids the confusion generated by focusing on the phrase "credits allowed" and meshing that with the giving of administrative credits under the TAA when a tax assessment is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">58 He submits that he is entitled to the benefit of those payments made on his behalf and already in the hands of the Commissioner for bankruptcy notice purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">This, in effect, is an attempt to distinguish the above decisions at first instance and on appeal in relation to when it was that the respondent was entitled to a credit for the $9,516 PAYG payments for the 2005 financial year as being confined to tax purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">However, it is to be remembered that those cases were concerned with an application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The decisions sit in that context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">I reject the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The respondent was not entitled to the credit during the period between the date of judgment and the date of issue of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Whilst amounts totalling $9,516 were undoubtedly paid to the applicant on behalf of the respondent they did not constitute "payments made" for the purposes of the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">59 As to the garnishee payments of $7,350, it is unnecessary to decide when they were received by the applicant, whether on 22 September 2005 as the applicant contends, or on various dates between December 2004 and 6 June 2005 according to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Accepting for present purposes only that they were received on the dates asserted by the respondent, the resultant overcharge of general interest charges extends only to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The applicant did not claim interest in the bankruptcy notice for the post-judgment period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Accordingly, it is the amount of the judgment debt which would, to the extent of those overcharges, be incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Such amounts were not credits or payments required to be included in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">What I said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [No 4] [2008] FCA 558 at [26] is apt on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The fact of such an overcharge would not operate to render, as a matter of law, the amount due under the bankruptcy notice as incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Extension of time under s 33(1)(c) 
 
60 The respondent, despite an invitation by counsel for the applicant to seek an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) of the Act for the giving of a notice under s 41(5) covering the alleged missed payments or credits, declined to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Accordingly, the position of the respondent is, as is evident also from his outline of closing submissions, confined to reliance upon para [36] of Mr Dundo's affidavit as constituting notice under s 41(5) for the purposes of the alleged missed payments and credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">61 If the respondent had sought such an extension of time, I would have refused to grant it on discretionary grounds as being futile for the same reasons as are set out under paras [55]-[59] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Section 306 of the Act 
 
62 The respondent submits that where notice in terms of s 41(5) was required, but not given, in respect to the alleged missed credits and payments, then the bankruptcy notice is nevertheless invalid and a nullity and is not saved by the operation of s 306 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">This, he submits, is so on two separate grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">First, the proper completion of item 5 in the Schedule to bankruptcy notices is a requirement made essential by the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Second, in this case, the missed payments and credits not reflected against item 5 could reasonably mislead a debtor in the position of Mr Cumins as to what is necessary to comply with the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The respondent, in this respect, relies upon Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">He submits that as he had not personally made the garnishee and PAYG payments or done the ATO calculations for credits, he could have no idea of what was or was not comprised in the figure $33,456 in Item 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">63 I do not accept these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">A bankruptcy notice is not liable to be set aside by reason only of an overstatement unless the debtor gives notice to the creditor under s 41(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I have found that such notice was required but not given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Accordingly, in my opinion, s 306 does not arise for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">I agree with what Sackville J said in obiter in Re Murdoch; Ex parte Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 737 at p 10 that where no notice under s 41(5) was given then the bankruptcy notice would not be invalid even if the overstatement of the amount due is capable of misleading the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">His Honour's remarks sat in the context of his consideration of s 306 of the Act in respect to an overstatement in a bankruptcy notice but where no notice under s 41(5) had been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The parties had proceeded on the assumption that s 306 had application in those circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">His Honour doubted the correctness of the assumption but the case was decided on the basis of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">His Honour's doubt was in my opinion, soundly based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">64 In Adams v Lambert, upon which the respondent relies, the bankruptcy notice was said to have been invalid because it referred to the incorrect statutory provision under which interest was claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">It did not concern any asserted overstatement in the bankruptcy notice of the amount due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Section 41(5) had no application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Section 306 did have application but the case is of no assistance in dealing with the nature of the interrelationship between s 41(5) and s 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">65 Alternatively, even if relevant notice under s 41(5) had been given, s 306 would have no application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">I have found that there was no overstatement of the amount due under the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">No other formal defect or irregularity is relied upon by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">66 In the present case, the applicant either obtains "the benefit" of s 41(5) because no notice was given, or alternatively, if notice was given she has rebutted the allegations of misstatements in the amount stated to be due under the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Section 306 relieves against the invalidating consequences of mistakes in the preparation of a bankruptcy notice: Adams v Lambert at [18] and [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">There were no mistakes in the present bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The section assumes the existence of a defect or irregularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">This much was conceded by counsel for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">None exists here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Re Florance; Ex parte Turimetta Properties Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 58 ; (1979) 28 ALR 403 , cited by the respondent is of no assistance on this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Section 52(1)(c) of the Act --- is the debt relied upon proved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 
67 Finally, the respondent submits that even if the bankruptcy notice were held not to contain any misstatement of amounts to be allowed or due, the amended petition nevertheless does not comply with s 52 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The amended petition relies on a debt of $38,032,100.01 owing by the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">This debt, the respondent submits, is not "still owing" and the requirements of s 52(1)(c) of the Act have not been met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">68 I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">On 6 May 2008 the judgment debt was varied by the Supreme Court of Western Australia to reduce it by $31,007.72.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This reflects the amount of certain payments and credits which, since the date of judgment, the applicant volunteered should be applied to the judgment debt by way of reduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The bankruptcy notice claimed an amount that is calculated by reference to the amount of the original judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">It is not to the point that the amount of that judgment has been reduced: Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 16 ; (1992) 33 FCR 581 at 587.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The affidavit of Deborah Jayne Thiele sworn on 12 May 2008, on behalf of the applicant deposes that the amount of the outstanding debt as at that date was $37,983,152.29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">This is the amount contained in the Amended Creditor's Petition less the amount by which the judgment debt was varied as well as the further amount of $17,940 in respect of credits applied after December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is the amount of the debt on which the applicant relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">This satisfies, as a matter of fact, the requirement under s 52(1)(c) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">69 The respondent further submits that the requirement under s 52(1)(c) has not been met because the judgment, as varied, has not been extracted and is accordingly presently unenforceable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Reliance was placed upon the decision of Re Hanby; Ex parte Flemington Central Spares Pty Ltd (1967) 10 FLR 378 at 381.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">That case concerns a circumstance where the judgment debt relied upon in the bankruptcy proceeding had actually been set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">That is not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Indeed the respondent's application to set aside the judgment debt was dismissed on 6 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The respondent has filed an appeal notice against the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The grounds of appeal are not disclosed in this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">I was not taken to the merits of the proposed appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Section 52(2)(b) of the Act - discretionary considerations 
 
70 The respondent submits that I should, in the exercise of my discretion, decline to make a sequestration order for "other sufficient cause": s 52(2)(b) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Three matters arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">71 First the respondent submits that, even if the PAYG payments of $9,516 did not give rise to an entitlement to a credit for that amount in the bankruptcy notice, I should take into account, as a discretionary consideration, the fact that these payments were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">No issue estoppel arises in this respect: Makhoul v Barnes (1995) 60 FCR 572 at 582.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">However, the fact that payments were received which did not, as a matter of law, give rise to any entitlement to a credit in that amount for a tax debt in respect of which judgment was given, does not commend itself to an exercise of discretion not to make a sequestration order in the overall circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">I would not exercise my discretion to that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">72 The second matter concerns the pending AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The respondent makes the following submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It cannot be said that the result of success by him in the proceedings before the AAT to have that matter re-opened and the interest deduction for borrowings in respect of the Infomercials allowed, would be that there was, in any event, still at least, part of the assessment, unaffected by the Infomercial interest, standing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">If he succeeds in the AAT proceedings, the Commissioner must implement the findings of the AAT and a fresh assessment would have to be issued: s 14ZZL of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) and s 170(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Only if and when that assessment occurs would there be an enforceable liability against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">There is no liability on him to pay tax until the relevant notice of assessment has been given: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 599 ; (2003) 129 FCR 276 at [27] , 282.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">73 The respondent further submits that even if it were to be accepted that he is presently facing an unshakeable claim of some $4.8 million in respect of the 1998 assessment, that figure raises very different issues in relation to possible payment or compromise of the claim than if he were to face the current $38 million claim in the bankruptcy notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The figure of $4.8 million is, I infer, a reference to a finding made in an earlier decision that the total amount of the judgment debt which is not related to the AAT applications is in the order of $4.8 million: Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353 at [63] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">74 Mr Kevin Dundo in his 29 April 2008 affidavit annexed a copy of the Outline of Submissions filed by the respondent in his application to the AAT seeking an extension of time for lodging an application to review the decision of the applicant made in an amended assessment in respect of the 1998 tax year pursuant to s 29(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) as well as his application in that matter for amendment or extension of the grounds of the objection lodged by him in respect of the amended assessment pursuant to s 14ZZK(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">75 There was no argument before me as to the content of these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">I earlier refused to adjourn the hearing of this petition despite the currency of the respondent's two applications to the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">I was not then satisfied that the respondent had established genuine and arguable grounds in relation to either of his AAT applications: Commissioner of Taxation v Cumins [2008] FCA 353.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">That position has not altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The respondent's submissions on the exercise of discretion are predicated upon his being successful, on the merits, before the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The likelihood of that occurring has not been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">76 Third, the respondent submits that, as found in St George at [41], the procedures provided by the Act are not intended to be used for the determination of complex accounting issues as between the petitioning creditor and debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">This is not such a case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">No complex accounting issues are present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">77 I would not exercise my discretion under s 52(2)(b) in favour of the respondent on any of these bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">CONCLUSION 
 
78 I am satisfied that the respondent committed the act of bankruptcy alleged in the petition as amended, and that the matters set out in s 52(1) of the Act have been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">I am also satisfied that there has been compliance with the Federal Court (Bankruptcy Rules) 2005 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">79 Mr Mark Anthony Conlan has consented to be the trustee of the respondent's estate in the event that a sequestration order is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">80 A sequestration order should be made against the estate of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The applicant's costs including any reserved costs should be taxed and paid out of the respondent's estate.</sentence>
