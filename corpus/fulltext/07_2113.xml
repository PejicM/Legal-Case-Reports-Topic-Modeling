<sentence id="s0">
 
1 I am going to deliver a short judgment approving the application and making an order for native title over this land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I will give my reasons now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Later they will be written down for anyone who wants to read them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The Court is sitting here today on the Yakka Yakka Track south of Balgo to hear an application for the determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">We are sitting in this country at the request of the applicants who want the Court to sit here because it overlooks part of the claim and it includes Nyili, Emily Springs, which is a very important part of the claim, where there is fresh water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The land covers 229, 718 square kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is in the Great Sandy Desert south east of the Kimberley and part of it touches the Northern Territory border.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is surrounded by other areas for which native title has been determined; Kiwirrkurra to the south, Tjurabalan to the north and Martu to the west.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The applicants' claim group is called Ngururrpa, a word which in English means "central".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Thus you people are central people and this is the central land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The claim group is about 1300 people and I think many of them must be here today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They are descended from 56 ancestors, all of whom we know about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The only parties to this case are the applicants, the Ngururrpa people, and the State of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Through mediation --- through good talking --- they have reached agreement that there should be a native title determination and they have agreed on the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They cover the whole of the land claimed except one little bit, which was a mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">That part is too small to worry about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 The law provides that the Federal Court can make a determination of native title in certain cases without having a hearing, without taking months and months to hear a big case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I am satisfied that the conditions that the law requires have been met and that the order that you want is within the power of the Court to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 In considering whether the Court should make the order as appropriate, I have taken into account that the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) encourages what you have done --- to resolve native title cases by agreement without the need for a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I have taken into account the benefits that come when people do agree to resolve their differences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I have taken into account, too, the very detailed and very good prepared material filed with the Court by the people, and their lawyers, as part of the application, and the very good joint submission put before the Court on behalf of the claim group and the State of Western Australia in support of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">7 The parties have also put forward a summary of The Countrymen Report ; that is Scott Cane's book --- three volumes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I have read all of Scott Cane's book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It has great things in it and I have read them all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I have got one here, it is Volume 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There are two other volumes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The parties have put forward a summary of Scott Cane's book and they have agreed that the facts in the summary are true facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 I have read an affidavit by Mr Gavin Dunn for the State of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The State has made its own assessment and has had its own experts look at this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Professor Basil Sansom has looked at this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 I am very satisfied that the agreement should receive the approval of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 But before I sign the Court's orders, I want to say this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The expedition with which the State undertook this process and the care with which the applicants have put their case is very commendable and it is very good that this case started and finished within less than a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It is also good that it has happened this way, because a lot of people have had goodwill and have come together to make the agreement; and that is a very good thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 Also, of course, it is relevant that I take into account that the parties have acted freely, with goodwill and with expert advice from the lawyers and anthropologists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The claimants have been very careful to put their case properly and the State of Western Australia has considered it very well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">12 Now, I am going to make the orders in the terms agreed, but before I do so, I want to say something more as a law person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I have said this before in the Western Desert but I want to say it again today near Nyili.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">13 In making these orders, the Court does not give you native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Court determines that native title exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Court determines that this is your land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">That it [the title] is based upon your traditional laws and customs which have always been; and that means that the law says to all the people of Australia that this is your land and it always has been your land because your laws and customs have said, and say today, that it is your land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">What the Court does is to say to everyone in Australia that this is your native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">14 So that is all I want to say ladies and gentlemen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Court agrees with the agreement that the parties have reached and I am now going to sign the determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It is a long document so I will not read it out, but the most important parts say that the Court declares and determines that native title exists in the determination area, and that it is held by the people who are the claimants, and that in respect of most of the interests, the title is for the use and occupation and enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of everyone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That means that it is your land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">15 I will now sign the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">16 Before the Court was closed the following spontaneous address was made by Mr Mark Moohra, one of the claimants:
 
 MR MARK MOOHRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I've got this through by old people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I live - because of old people taught me which our land is and I've been waiting and talking for the last 20 years or more and now I got it here for people and for all our young people to come, in years to years to come, generation to generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Yeway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">When you generation take over, when you new generation take over, we want to see - you got to live in one big happy family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Not fighting or starting war in this country, we want peace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">We want to see people live in peace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of the court hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Close the Court, please, Mr Sheppard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">


 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Chief Justice Black.</sentence>
