1 On 26 September 2007 I delivered Reasons for Judgment in this matter, and I directed the applicants to bring in Draft Short Minutes of Order to formulate the appropriate final orders giving effect to my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 I have now received submissions from the parties in relation to the form of the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">As a result of constructive discussions which took place between the parties prior to this hearing, there remains only one order in dispute, namely order 3 proposed by the applicants ("Brother").</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 Order 3 proposed by Brother reads:
 
 '... the respondent, whether by itself, its officers, employees or agents or otherwise however, permanently be restrained from infringing any of the Brother Trade Marks by importing, distributing, offering for sale, selling or otherwise dealing in the course of trade with: 
 
 (a) any goods in respect of which any of the Brother Trade Marks are registered; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) goods of the same description as any of the goods in respect of which any of the Brother Trade Marks are registered, 
 
 
 
 
 under or by reference to any one or more of the Brother Trade Marks or any name, word, mark, sign or device which is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to any one or more of the Brother Trade Marks without the licence or authority of the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">' 
 

I have added emphasis to the above passage to highlight those parts of the proposed order with which the respondent ("Dynamic Supplies") does not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 Dynamic Supplies submit that Brother's proposed order 3 is broader than the Court's reasons, which related to the counterfeit packaging in which certain products manufactured by Brother were packaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The expressions " under or by reference to " and " without the licence or authority of the applicant ", it is said, lack clarity, are ambiguous and do not enable Dynamic Supplies to identify the conduct which is prohibited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 In support of this submission, Dynamic Supplies referred to the recent decision in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In that case, the Full Court at [104] accepted the proposition that injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether their conduct falls within the scope of the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">This is because failure to comply with the terms of a court order may give rise to contempt proceedings in which determination of questions of construction of the terms of the injunction is not appropriate since ambiguity or uncertainty may be a defence in such proceedings: see ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 259 (per Lockhart J); MacLean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 593 at 599 (per Toohey J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Similar remarks were made by a Full Court of this Court in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563 at 574-575, where the Court adopted the principle that injunctive relief should be based upon the specific case alleged and proved against the defendant, and indicate in clear terms the conduct enjoined so that he or she knows what is expected to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">6 Dynamic Supplies contends that order 3, as framed by Brother, would prohibit it from engaging in parallel importation of genuine Brother DR-200 printer drum units packaged in genuine Brother boxes if Brother did not want to project those goods from another country into Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Quite apart from the difficulty for Dynamic Supplies establishing that Brother in fact intended to project the sale of its goods into Australia, such a finding, it is said, would run contrary to the settled law that there is no prohibition against parallel importation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">With Brother acknowledging that the order it proposed was not intended to cover parallel importation, Dynamic Supplies submits that the pleadings, the trial, the course of evidence and the Court's decision did not, and should not now in effect, enjoin it from any such parallel importation of genuine goods genuinely packaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 Dynamic Supplies also submits that the Court's decision was based on the limited evidence placed before it, and that as a consequence there is no basis on which it can order the relief sought in Brother's proposed order because the breadth of such relief would, in effect, relate to an entirely different case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">As a matter of practical illustration, Dynamic Supplies says that the breadth of the proposed order would require it to break not only the boxes in which the printer drum units are transported, but also the aluminium bags in which they are packaged, in order to ascertain whether the goods are being dealt with " under or by reference to " Brother's registered Australian trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">To remedy this, Dynamic Supplies suggests that this phrase should be replaced with the phrase " in packaging to which ", thereby clarifying that it is the packaging which is the subject of the restraining order, and not also the goods transported inside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">For the same reasons, it also suggests that the words " have been applied " should precede " without licence or authority ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 Contrary to Dynamic Supplies' position, Brother says that the breadth of its proposed order 3 is appropriate when one has regard to the need for the Court to express disapproval of the original breach and deter future breaches, the need to effectively monitor the situation, and the wide powers of the Court under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Brother submits that the case was not solely about packaging but also involved considerations of infringement and misleading conduct in relation to printer drum units to which Brother's registered Australian trade marks had been wrongly applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It says the expression " under or by reference to " is neither vague nor ambiguous, and that the Court should be wary to make orders that are too precise in expression because this would be conducive to evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Brother concludes that, on these matters alone, Dynamic Supplies should be restrained from dealing with any and all units to which the Brother's trade marks have been wrongly applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 However, Brother also points to the conduct of the case by Dynamic Supplies, and emphasises the way in which Dynamic Supplies gave broad denials which were ultimately proven wrong, made baseless allegations against Brother, was unsuccessful in its counter-claim and refused at the time to give any undertaking not to repeat the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On the basis of these considerations, and on the fact the Dynamic Supplies now seeks a narrowing of the proposed orders because it does not wish to bear the burden of properly inspecting the goods it imports, Brother invites the inference that there is a real threat that other or further breaches will be committed by Dynamic Supplies unless it is restrained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">CONSIDERATION 
 
10 The decision of 26 September 2007 essentially turned on the use of counterfeit packaging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">While it is reasonably clear that dealing in counterfeit Brother units, if it occurred, would infringe Brother registered Australian trade marks, I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to frame the injunction in a way that discourages such anticipated future infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The case did not involve counterfeit products, and therefore restraining orders should not be made in relation to counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I do not infer from Dynamic Supplies' conduct of its case and the other matters raised by Brother that there is sufficient threat to warrant a restraining order of a pre-emptive nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In my view, these matters are not sufficient grounds on which to anticipate a threat to commit further breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Rather, I anticipate that these proceedings and their outcome will deter Dynamic Supplies from committing any further breaches in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 Although I decline to make order 3 in the exact form proposed by Brother, I do accept Brother's submission that the practical difficulties raised by Dynamic Supplies in relation to inspection of the products it imports are not insuperable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">For example, random sampling could be used to check the products and thereby monitor compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In addition, greater care should be taken by Dynamic Supplies to verify the integrity and authenticity of the source from which the Brother products are obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">These are measures which Dynamic Supplies would do well to incorporate into its usual business practice as part of its bona fide compliance with the orders attaching to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 As noted by Lockhart J in ICI Australia 38 FCR at 259, it is imperative that restraining orders are precisely formulated because contempt proceedings with serious consequences can flow from a failure to comply with such orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In the light of this, and having regard to my earlier reasons in this matter, I consider that the words " under or by reference to " proposed by Brother are too extensive in their reach because they are capable of including conduct beyond that in respect of which specific findings have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">13 I therefore consider that the orders proposed by Brother are appropriate, with the exception of proposed order 3, for which Dynamic Supplies' proposed order 3 should be substituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">14 In relation to the question of costs of this application relating to the form of orders, I note there have clearly been constructive discussions between the parties in relation to the form of the proposed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I therefore consider there should be no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">15 I direct the parties to come before me for further directions in this matter at a time to be arranged with my associate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.</sentence>
