<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application for the winding up of Arizcorp Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">There has been no appearance on behalf of the defendant this morning on the return date for the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The matter was called on at approximately 10.15 am and no appearance was recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The matter was then stood down until 11.00 am and called again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">There has been no appearance upon the matter being called for the second time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The plaintiff has provided a list of materials which are read on the application, and has provided a chronology and written submissions in relation to the merits in support of the making of a winding up order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Prior to the matter being called on this morning the defendant had provided submissions through lawyers Groom &amp; Lavers and in those submissions the proposition was being advanced that there are special circumstances which would warrant the application being adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Without descending into all the detail of the matter, there has been a history of negotiations between representatives of the defendant and financiers, including Macquarie Bank, and others, to raise money to enable the plaintiff's claim to be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In the course of those matters, a cheque was drawn and made payable to the Commissioner, which upon presentation was dishonoured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That payment apparently was made in the context of anticipated fruitful refinancing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Upon the failure of those arrangements and the dishonouring of the cheque, the defendant apparently has engaged in other discussions with a view to securing a sale of an asset described as its "rent roll".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The submissions set out five matters which are said to constitute special circumstances which would warrant the matter being adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Two things need to be said about that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The first is that the defendant has not appeared to articulate the merits of those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Secondly, I am not satisfied, in any event, that they constitute special circumstances, particularly having regard to the payment to the Commissioner of a cheque in discharge of a liability which has been dishonoured upon presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Accordingly I propose to make an order that the defendant be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Associate:
