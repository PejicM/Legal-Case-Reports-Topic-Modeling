1 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) seeks an order under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for the winding-up of an unregistered managed investment scheme known as "FUELbanc" as well as declarations, injunctions and various ancillary orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The first to fourth defendants respectively are companies FUELbanc Australia Limited (a company limited by guarantee), PayCards Global Pty Ltd, Paycards Investments Pty Ltd and PC Property Group Pty Ltd. 
 
3 By order of Young J in this Court on 20 July 2006 Messrs Adrian Brown and George Georges were appointed receivers of all the property of the scheme and provisional liquidators of the first to fourth defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">4 The fifth defendant Stephen McDougall was the moving force behind the FUELbanc scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His sons Messrs Timothy McDougall and Matthew McDougall, the sixth and seventh defendants, were also involved but to a lesser extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">5 The orders sought by ASIC are not opposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The FUELbanc scheme 
 
6 Stephen McDougall earlier devised and operated a scheme known as "FullTank" which was wound up as an unregistered managed investment scheme by order of Young J on 20 April 2006: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McDougall (2006) 229 ALR 158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">7 Under the FullTank scheme participants would pay a flat "Membership Fee" and a "Plan Fee".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">They were issued with a debit card which could be used to purchase fuel and other goods at service stations through the EFTPOS system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The debit card would be loaded each week with a nominated amount for purchases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The promise held out was that over a given period participants could receive an effective discount of 50 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For example, for a Plan Fee of $250 the participant was promised $25 worth of fuel per week for 20 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">8 The FUELbanc scheme also involves debit cards issued for the purchase of fuel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Its distinguishing feature, however, is the use of a barter system known as "E Banc" in which goods and services are exchanged for barter units known as "trade dollars" as well as ordinary Australian currency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">E Banc is operated by E Banc Trade Pty Ltd. That company is not connected with the defendants and is not involved in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">E Banc maintains a central register where its members' barter units and balances and unit transfers are recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">9 Under the FUELbanc scheme, participants stipulate a "weekly fuel requirement" in dollars and pay the total amount, either 26 times or 52 times the weekly amount, half in cash and half in E Banc "trade dollars", in addition to a "joining" or "setup" fee of $99.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is stated that the participant must become a member of FUELbanc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">10 In return, FUELbanc promises to pay each Sunday the weekly amount into a debit card for use by the participant at service stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">11 The debit card is provided by an unrelated company called E-Merchants Australia Pty Ltd which holds the necessary Australian Financial Services Licence for dealing in credit cards and has appointed FUELbanc as its Authorised Agent for that limited purpose
 
12 The website on which the FUELbanc scheme is promoted states that FUELbanc lends both the Australian dollars and the "trade dollars" to PayCards Global and that FUELbanc's ability to meet its instalment obligations to participants is dependant on those loans being repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">13 In fact, as ASIC's investigations have revealed, what has happened with participants' money is very different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">14 Stephen McDougall's idea was that the cash contribution (or at least some of it) would be invested with Paycards Investments outside Australia to produce the return necessary to fund the crediting of participants' debit cards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This would require a return of more than 100 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">15 Investigations by Ms Sonia Kohary, a Financial Investigator employed by ASIC, revealed the following as at 14 July 2006:
 
&#8226; Of $640,000 received by FUELbanc from participants, 46 per cent ($310,000) has been transferred to PayCards Global of which only $11,000 has been identified as being repaid; 38 per cent ($243,000) has been paid directly to E-Merchants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Therefore FUELbanc has been relying on the ongoing deposit of new participants' funds to meet its obligations to existing participants;
 
&#8226; PayCards Global received approximately $439,000 (including the transfer of $310,600 from FUELbanc).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Over 58 per cent of funds disbursed ($257,000) are part of 317 transactions of less than $6000 each to unidentified accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The books of PayCards Global indicate that some of these funds totalling approximately $133,000 have been distributed for the benefit of the directors or their related parties;
 
&#8226; PayCards Global has only transferred some $80,000 to Paycards Investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Of this $80,000, approximately $63,000 has been transferred offshore for investment in gold coin bullion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Paycards Investments have only returned $36,700 to PayCards Global;
 
&#8226; As at 31 May 2006 there was less than $45,000 in total in the bank accounts of FUELbanc, Paycards Investments, PayCards Global and PC Property Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">16 Some "trade dollars" have been used to pay part of the purchase price of real estate brought by Stephen McDougall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He claims that this purchase was for Paycards Investments but the transaction appears to play no part in funding debit cards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">17 In substance the credits available to participants on their debit cards were funded from participants' contributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">18 Scheme funds have been used for the McDougalls' own purposes such as the leasing of motor vehicles for themselves and friends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">19 As at 14 July 2006, according to Mr Andrew Price, an ASIC Senior Investigator holding delegated functions and powers under Pt 3 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth):
 
&#8226; Since its launch in early 2006 the FUELbanc scheme had attracted some 720 participants and continues to draw about 20 new participants each week;
 
&#8226; Participants had contributed $650,000 and 700,000 "trade dollars";
 
&#8226; FUELbanc's weekly commitments to participants was $59,000 and that figure was growing each week;
 
&#8226; PayCards Global's costs were $5,000 to $6,000 per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">20 The McDougalls could not tell ASIC where most of the FUELbanc money had gone, except that Stephen McDougall said it was invested offshore in unspecified high yield programs on the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He estimated that there was approximately just under $1 million invested generating returns of 5 to 20 per cent per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He said that information as to theses investments had been kept from other directors as it was his responsibility to protect what he described as his "intellectual property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">21 In Mr Price's opinion, the FUELbanc scheme may be a Ponzi scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Taking its name from the famous American fraudster Carlo Ponzi (1882-1949) and his postal coupon scam of 1920, a Ponzi scheme is one where deposits of new participants are relied on to make payments to existing participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">22 According to Stephen McDougall, the scheme needed to generate returns of 3 per cent per week or 160 per cent per annum to be able to meet its weekly commitments to members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In fact, ASIC says, the required return for FUELbanc to be able to meet its weekly commitments to participants without relying on the contributions of new participants is between 375 per cent per annum and 1980 per cent per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">23 Stephen McDougall has not candidly revealed in a way that can be confidently corroborated what he has done with scheme funds and ASIC has not been able to locate them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Contraventions: Unregistered Managed Investment Scheme 
 
24 Relevantly, s 9 of the Corporations Act defines a "managed investment scheme" as a scheme that has the following features:
 
 
 "(a) (i) people contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not); 
 (ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders); 
 (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" 

25 The definition in pars (c) to (n) excludes various entities, funds or schemes from the scope of this definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It will not be necessary to say anything about any of these except for 
 
 "(d) a body corporate ..." 
 

26 Section 601ED(1)(a) provides that a managed investment scheme must be registered under s 601EB if it has more than 20 members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">27 Section 601ED(5) provides that a person must not "operate in this jurisdiction" a managed investment scheme that is required to be registered under s 601EB unless the scheme is so registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">28 Section 601EE(1)(a) provides that if a person operates a managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) , ASIC may apply to the Court to have the scheme wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Under s 601EE(2) , in the event that ASIC makes an application of the kind described in subs (1) the Court may make any orders that it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme 
 
29 The FUELbanc scheme is a managed investment scheme within the meaning of the definition in s 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Participants contribute money and money's worth as consideration to acquire rights to benefits produced by the scheme namely the FUELbanc debit card and the rights and benefits which come with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Those contributions are pooled or used in a common enterprise to produce financial benefits for the members who hold interests in the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The participants do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">30 The scheme required registration under s 601ED(1)(a) because it had more than 20 members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The scheme has not been registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">31 The defendants have been operating the scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The corporate defendants were integral to the planned cycle of solicitation, investment and distribution of scheme funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Stephen McDougall was also the directing and guiding mind of the corporate defendants and the scheme as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">32 The "body corporate" exception (see [25] above) does not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The purpose of this exception is to ensure that the ordinary engagement of a company in commercial activities does not come within the managed investment scheme regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The contract created by a company's constitution (see now Corporations Act s 140(1)) only affords rights or imposes obligations on a member in his or her capacity as a member: Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep Breeders' Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 at 897.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The essence of the FUELbanc scheme is that a participant provides "trade dollars" and cash in return for a promise to provide credit for the purchase of fuel over a future period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The legal foundation for this arrangement is not membership of the company but the contractual relationship between the company and the participant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Relevantly for present purposes, the participant becomes a member of the scheme whether or not he or she becomes a member of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">(In any event, ASIC has been unable to discover any membership registers, minutes or other records which might prove that participants in fact became members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">) 
 Contraventions: Financial Services Business 
 
33 Section 763B of the Corporations Act provides:
 
 "For the purposes of this Chapter [ie Chapter 7 --- Financial Services and Markets], a person (the investor) makes a financial investment if: 
 
 
 
 (a) the investor gives money or money's worth (the contribution) to another person and any of the following apply: 
 
 
 
 (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; 
 (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); 
 (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); and 
 
 
 
 (b) the investor has no day-to-day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">" 
 

34 Participants in the FUELbanc scheme are making a "financial investment" within the meaning of s 763B because they give money to FUELbanc which uses the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The participant intends that FUELbanc will use the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for him or her and FUELbanc intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In all these respects the contribution is caught even if no return or benefit is in fact generated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">35 The FUELbanc scheme is a "financial product" because it is a facility through which participants make a financial investment: s 763A(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">36 FUELbanc is the "issuer" of that product because it is the person responsible for the obligations owed to the "client" (the participant) under the terms of the facility that is the financial product: s 761E(4)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">37 Because FUELbanc is issuing a financial product it is "dealing" in that product: s 766C(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">38 Because FUELbanc is dealing in a financial product it is "provid(ing) a financial service": s 766A(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">39 FUELbanc is therefore carrying on a "financial services business" within the meaning of s 761A and must hold an Australian financial services licence to do so: s 911A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">40 No defendant holds an Australian financial services licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Liability of Stephen McDougall 
 
41 ASIC seeks orders against Stephen McDougall but not against Timothy and Matthew McDougall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Against the latter two defendants the order sought is that the proceeding be dismissed with no order as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">42 In respect of the FUELbanc unregistered managed investment scheme, was Stephen McDougall a person "operat(ing)" the scheme within the meaning of s 601EE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">As Davies AJ said in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [55]:
 
 "The term [operate] is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">" 

43 This passage was applied in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488 at [32] and in McDougall at [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">44 Here there is no doubt that Stephen McDougall formulated the scheme and managed its day to day operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">He was thus one of those operating the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">45 As to Stephen McDougall's liability for carrying on a financial services business without a licence, the same reasoning applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In any event he would clearly have aided, abetted, counselled and procured FUELbanc to contravene the Act: s 1324(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Declarations 
 
46 ASIC seeks declarations that:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">From January 2006 to July 2006 the first, second, third, fourth and fifth defendants contravened s 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by operating the unregistered managed investment scheme defined in the Schedule to this Order ("the scheme") which required registration as a managed investment scheme but was not so registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">From January 2006 to July 2006 the first, second, third, fourth and fifth defendants contravened s 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction by offering interests in the scheme without holding an Australian financial services licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">

47 Although, as I have already noted, the orders sought by ASIC were not opposed, Mr Scott very properly drew my attention to the decision of Fryberg J of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings [2006] QSC 276 , a case which also concerned an unregistered managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">His Honour declined to make a declaration against two individuals involved on the ground that the possibility of a prosecution was open and ASIC had refused to give any undertaking that prosecution would not follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">His Honour said (at [4]):
 
 "Where the possibility of the prosecution is open, it would, in my judgment, be contrary to the ordinary practice for the authority of this Court to be given to a declaration which, in substance, amounted to a declaration that the defendant had committed a crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">One should not make a declaration which might be falsified by a subsequent acquittal in proceedings between the same parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">" 
 

In the present case ASIC does not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">48 The jurisdiction of the Federal Court to make declarations is founded in s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which provides:
 
 "The Court may, in relation to a matter in which it has original jurisdiction, make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">" 

As a superior court, the Federal Court would also have inherent power to grant declaratory relief: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">49 Section 21(1) has as its ancestor O XXV r 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 (Eng) which developed from the first English legislative provision, s 50 of the Chancery Procedure Act 1852 (UK): see Tobacco Institute of Australia Limited v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 108-109 per Hill J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Although prior to the English legislation mentioned courts of that country had a "deep suspicion" of the declaration of right (Zamir and Woolf The Declaratory Judgment , second edition, 1993, at 11), it seems as though this reluctance only extended to the grant of "pure" declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Thus in Clough v Ratcliff (1847) 1 De G &amp; Sm 164 at 178 Knight Bruce V-C said:
 
 "Nakedly to declare a right, without doing or directing anything else relating to the right, does not, I conceive, belong to the functions of this Court [of Chancery].</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">" 

50 In the present case, the proposed declarations are not "pure", abstract or hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">They simply record, in a formal way, the conclusion which the Court has reached, on the evidence, as to the legal consequences of specific conduct of the defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The effect on any future hypothetical criminal prosecution would be the same whether this Court now granted declarations together with injunctions or granted injunctions only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Either way there would be a finding of a court as to the lawfulness of the conduct the subject of the criminal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">51 While courts are still reluctant to grant declaratory relief on issues which are theoretical or hypothetical (see Zamir and Woolf, op cit, 117 et seq), the Intertax argument against the grant of declaratory relief is based on a hypothetical fact, indeed a hypothesis upon a hypothesis --- that there will be a prosecution and that such prosecution will result in an acquittal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">52 There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 the High Court, in respect of then current committal proceedings (ie actual, not hypothetical, criminal proceedings) made declarations that (i) certain documents were privileged from production and that (ii) the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Gibbs ACJ said at 20-21:
 
 "It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration, under a provision such as s 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (N.S.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">), as amended, or O.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">26, r. 19 of the Rules of this Court, is a very wide one: Forster v. Jododex Aust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Pty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">[1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421, at pp 435-436 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Indeed in Dyson v. Attorney-General [1911] 1 KB 410, which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject, it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence --- see especially per Farwell L.J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">[1911]1 KB, at p 422.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">" 
 
 

53 Of direct application to the present case is Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The case concerned a pine plantation investment scheme which the Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) alleged involved the issuing or offering of an "interest" contrary to s 76(1) of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The trial judge made a declaration to the effect alleged and granted injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but said that it was not a proper case for the grant of declarations, which were "little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The High Court dismissed the substantive appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The parties accepted that an injunction was no longer necessary since the conduct in question was not continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The High Court nevertheless granted a declaration substantially to the effect of that granted by the trial judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">54 The contraventions the subject of the declaration in Australian Softwood carried criminal penalties: Companies Act, s 86(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Murphy J thought this was a positive reason for the grant of a declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Certainly his Honour saw the possibility, indeed desirability, of criminal proceedings as no reason for refusing a declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">His Honour commenced his judgment as follows at (136):
 
 "One of the most widespread and successful of the species of fraud known in Australia and elsewhere as 'the investment racket' is the forest or plantation variety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">" 

 
Later (at 137) his Honour said that the appellant
 
 " ... has already procured signatures and acceptances from more than 4000 persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">This represents more than $200,000 in deposits and promises to pay instalments of well over a million dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Presumably all those who have been party to offences against the Companies Act in relation to the issues are liable to criminal proceedings, at least with the consent of the Minister (see s 381).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In these circumstances, and because the respondent did not press in this Court for the injunction, I agree the relief should be confined to appropriate declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">" 

55 In Intertax Fryberg J (at [8]) distinguished Australian Softwood on the ground that the High Court's approval 
 
 "... was to the proposition that a declaration could be granted notwithstanding that an injunction would not be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">" 
 

If by this his Honour meant that the High Court only granted a declaration because, with the consent of the parties, they did not grant an injunction, then I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Gibbs CJ said (at 125):
 
 "With all respect, Hutley JA was not correct in saying that declarations 'are little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In my opinion it was proper to grant a declaration in the present case although it is now agreed that an injunction is not an appropriate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">" 
 

In any case, if it were only appropriate to make declarations where injunctions were not granted, that would not get over the supposed problem of possible "falsification" by subsequent acquittal in criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">56 In Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 596 Young J gave detailed consideration to the appropriateness of declarations in respect of breaches of the Companies (New South Wales) Code dealing with prescribed interests and offers to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Criminal proceedings were not only possible; they had taken place and the individual primarily involved had been convicted and was serving a term of imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">57 His Honour observed (at 603) that while ordinarily a declaration is not made that a defendant has committed a crime, there was no doubt that there was jurisdiction to make such a declaration in a proper case: Imperial Tobacco Limited v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718 at 750, Sankey v Whitlam .</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Conversely, the right was mutual; the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person's conduct contravened the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">That practice, which was common in New South Wales, had been given the "seal of approval" by the High Court in Australian Softwood .</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">58 In the particular circumstances of the case, however, Young J (at 616) saw no utility in pronouncing declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The injunctions already made dealt with the issues between the parties, the receivership orders were still in place and the making of a declaration would be unsatisfactory because of the possibly incomplete factual material before the court and also because it might embarrass investors' claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">This latter aspect included the fact that investors had subscribed to at least eleven different schemes, the funds of which had become irretrievably mixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">59 Transphere does not provide any support for the limitation of the discretion to make declarations in cases like the present; indeed it is to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">60 A number of courts have made declarations in cases involving contraventions which carried criminal penalties, albeit with no express discussion of the point raised in Intertax .</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Nevertheless, the consistent practice is a matter of considerable weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The cases are: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2006] QCA 540 (Queensland Court of Appeal), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v PFS Business Development Group Pty Ltd (2006) 57 ACSR 553 (Hargrave J, Supreme Court of Victoria), McDougall (Young J, Federal Court), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Preston [2005] FCA 1805 (Finkelstein J, Federal Court), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 68 (Jones J, Supreme Court of Queensland), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Young [2003] QSC 29 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 655 (Muir J, Supreme Court of Queensland), Pegasus (Davies AJ, Supreme Court of New South Wales), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Hutchings (2001) 19 ACLC 1454 (Windeyer J, Supreme Court New South Wales), Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 (Austin J, Supreme Court of New South Wales).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">61 I conclude that I should not follow Intertax .</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It is appropriate to make the declarations sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It is sometimes said that a declaration is an appropriate way of marking the Court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see eg McDougall at [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">While certainly the conduct of the corporate defendants and Stephen McDougall has been reprehensible, the actual declarations do no more than declare the bare facts that the defendants operated an unregistered managed investment scheme and carried on a financial services business without a licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The declarations would be equally appropriate if the defendants' business had been carried on with exemplary prudence and meticulous bookkeeping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">A more satisfactory rationale may be that the right declared will be a public right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In Tobacco Institute (at 98) Sheppard J said that the declaration in that case would
 
 " ... be a declaration of right because the right which will be declared will be a public right, namely, the right of the public not to be misled or deceived by factual statements in an advertisement concerning the effects of passive smoking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">" 


In the present case the legislation contravened protects public rights by regulating the conduct of those who seek investment from the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Declarations as to the contraventions provide a formal vindication of the law's operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">62 Two final points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">First, declarations will not usually be made when the only material before the Court is the consent of the parties: BMI Limited v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401 at 412.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">As will have been apparent, in the present case ASIC has presented evidence and submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">63 Secondly, it is said there must be "a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought": Russian Commercial &amp; Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 at 448, Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437, Transphere at 605.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">64 In the present case the defendants were represented but did not oppose the making of the declarations sought, or indeed any orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Transphere is to an extent comparable in that the defendant in that case appeared and did not oppose the declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However, he we not legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Young J (at 605-608) extensively reviewed the case law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">His Honour (at 608) accepted the submission that the law as to declaratory judgments had developed to such a stage that declaration should be made unless there are proper grounds to the contrary, subject to the proviso that a "legitimate and powerful" factor against the grant would be the possibility of embarrassment in a practical sense to a non-party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">As has been noted ([58] above) his Honour found that in the circumstances of the case before him such embarrassment did exist and on that ground declined a declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">65 One of the authorities discussed by Young J was BMI .</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In that case Keely and Beaumont JJ (at 413), after referring to what was said by Buckley LJ and Scarman J in Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991 at 1029 and 1030 respectively, said:
 
 " ... we think that it is generally undesirable that the court should grant relief by way of declaratory orders under s 108 [of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth)] in the absence of any contest on the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">" 


Their Honours acknowledged (at 414) that, if it were demonstrated in a particular case that it were necessary that the question be resolved judicially, it may be appropriate for the court to appoint an amicus curiae to put the contrary view, if any, on the facts and on the questions of law which arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">66 In BMI not only was there no contradictor, but the particular question that was the subject of the proposed declaration had become academic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Moreover, there were a number of contrary arguments on the merits; see 414-415.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The Full Court did not propound any binding proposition of law, still less one which would bind single judges deciding cases under investor protection provisions of corporations legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">67 The suggestion of retaining counsel to put a contrary argument as amicus curiae raises the practical question as to who should foot the bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Certainly it would be unreasonable to impose on the generosity of counsel who have volunteered for pro bono schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">It is no function of the Court itself to expend money on filling a supposed gap in the range of arguments presented to it by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">And ASIC has limited public funds to spend on its important law enforcement functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">68 In the present case, there being no suggestion of any embarrassment to non-parties in the present case, I will follow the principle accepted by Young J in Transphere .</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Orders 
 
69 I will make the declarations referred to above ([46]), and the following orders:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Pursuant to s 1324(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) the fifth defendant be permanently restrained whether by himself, his servants or agents or otherwise from further operating or promoting the scheme.</sentence>

<sentence id="s179">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Pursuant to ss 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) the fifth defendant be restrained, whether by himself, his servants or agents or otherwise from carrying on business in relation to financial products or financial services by:

<sentence id="s185">6.</sentence>

<sentence id="s189">8.</sentence>

<sentence id="s191">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Pursuant to s 461(1)(k) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) the first, second, third and fourth defendants be wound up and that George Georges and Adrian Brown be appointed joint and several liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">10.</sentence>
