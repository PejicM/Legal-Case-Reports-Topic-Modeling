 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the ACCC'), being the applicant, and EDirect Pty Ltd ('EDirect'), the first respondent, and two of its directors, Vishal Gupta and Manan Chopra, the second and third respondents (together the 'respondents'), have agreed to settle this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">To give effect to that settlement they have applied to the Court for certain final orders by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The consent orders involve the Court making orders:
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">For declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the respondents have contravened, or been involved in contraventions of, ss 52 and 58 of Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">For injunctions under s 80 of the Act to restrain the respondents from engaging in certain conduct in relation to future customers and from enforcing any early termination charges for the termination of mobile service plans of a specified list of their existing customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">c. Under s 86C of the Act requiring EDirect to, among other things, implement and maintain a Trade Practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">d. That the respondents pay the applicant's costs fixed in the sum of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 

3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In addition to these consent orders, the respondents have provided the ACCC with a Court enforceable undertaking pursuant to s 87B of the the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Pursuant to this undertaking, EDirect will, among other things, offer refunds to certain of its customers together with the opportunity to terminate their mobile service plans without charge or penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">MATERIALS RELIED ON 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In asking the Court to make these consent orders the parties have relied on the following: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The statement of claim filed by the ACCC on 24 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This is a detailed document, extending over 36 pages, which sets out the particulars of EDirect's various alleged breaches of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The defence which EDirect was given leave to file at the hearing on 10 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">This is a very brief document in which EDirect admits all of the breaches alleged in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">c. The affidavit of Gary Clements sworn 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This affidavit establishes the provenance of the voice recordings that are then dealt with in more detail in the affidavit of Ms Vaughan immediately below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">d. The affidavit of Sharyn Maree Vaughan sworn 3 December 2007 with numerous annexures including a compact disc and the transcripts of the voice recordings obtained by Mr Clements from EDirect (see above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These voice recordings are of various telephone conversations between EDirect's telemarketers and potential customers which are relied upon to establish EDirect's various breaches of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">e. A copy of EDirect's 'Summary of Standard Form of Agreement Terms and Conditions', in effect between 2 January 2007 and 28 March 2007. 
 f. The affidavit of Peter Damian Moon sworn 6 December 2007, filed on behalf of EDirect, relating to the proposed community service radio broadcasts included in the consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Mr Moon deposes to his discussions with a Mr Ed Knowles, the General Manager of the National Indigenous Radio Service (NIRS) to the effect that it is " absolutely appropriate' ' in his opinion to broadcast them in English notwithstanding that the consumers to whom these broadcasts are mainly directed are Aboriginal people living in remote communities for whom English is commonly a second language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">g. The affidavit of Heidi Ann Snell sworn 10 December 2007, filed on behalf of ACCC, relating to the same issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Ms Snell deposes to the fact that 42 of the customers affected by EDirect's misrepresentations about coverage live in remote Aboriginal communities --- 3 in Western Australia, 16 in Queensland and 23 in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Ms Snell also deposes to discussions she has had with the Indigenous Consumer Action Network (ICAN), an organisation that deals with consumers in the Cape York Peninsula, to the effect that the community service radio broadcasts " would most likely be made in English ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I take that to mean 'most appropriately' be made in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In relation to the 23 Northern Territory customers, Ms Snell deposes to discussions she has had with the Anti Discrimination Commission in the Northern Territory to the effect that there are four key Aboriginal languages spoken in the various communities where those customers live.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">However, Ms Snell's affidavit does not go so far as to say that it would be inappropriate for the community service radio broadcasts to be in English, or conversely, that it would be more appropriate for them to be in one or all of the four key Aboriginal languages mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I will return to this issue later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">h. The amended form of the consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">A number of amendments were made to the consent orders, by the parties, as a result of matters that were raised during the hearing of this matter on 10 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">For example, the disparity between the time periods during which EDirect, the company, on the one hand, and its directors, on the other, were to be restrained by the injunction orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">As originally proposed, EDirect was to be restrained for five years and the two directors were to be restrained for three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The amended form of consent orders now proposes that the respondents be restrained for four years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">A further set of amendments was made to the consent orders after certain concerns I had with the form of some of the orders were raised with the parties on 20 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The details of these changes are dealt with in some more detail in the section headed 'Submissions' below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In addition to the materials listed above, Counsel for the ACCC, Mr Cox, arranged at the hearing on the 5 th of December 2007 to play a part of the compact disc (Annexure SV --- 6 to Ms Vaughan's affidavit) of the voice recordings of the sales calls between the telemarketers on behalf of EDirect and two customers, one named "Jacko" and the other named "Kirsty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 SUBMISSIONS 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Both Mr Cox, for the ACCC, and Mr Ng, for Edirect and its directors, made written and oral submissions at the main hearing of this matter on 5 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The matter was also mentioned briefly on 10 December 2007 and 5 February 2008 to deal with the appropriate language for the community service radio broadcasts and my concerns about the form of some of the proposed consent orders, respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 5 December 2007, in summary, Mr Cox submitted that the Court had jurisdiction to make the consent orders and it was appropriate that they be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He submitted that the declarations were in the public interest and that they would, among other things; serve to mark the Court's disapproval of EDirect's conduct, to assist the ACCC to carry out its duties, to inform and warn the public of such conduct occurring; and to act as a deterrence against future breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">As to the injunction orders, he submitted that they were precise in their terms, that there was a real nexus between EDirect's conduct and the orders sought and that they served to prevent a repetition of conduct that involved repeated breaches over a sustained period, with a reckless disregard for the provisions of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">At the outset of his submissions, Mr Ng was at pains to make it clear that he did not wish to detract in any way from EDirect's admissions that it had breached the Act and had therefore consented to the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">However, he submitted, among other things, that it was not clear that EDirect should have known that the 'no coverage' customers could not connect to a network and, that there was no intentional deception involved on EDirect's part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">At the conclusion of the hearing, before reserving my decision, I raised some concerns I had about the community service radio broadcasts and, in particular, whether it was appropriate that they be in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I have dealt with this issue later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">During the course of preparing these reasons, I had occasion to consider the form of the consent orders more closely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In that process, I became concerned about seven specific aspects of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">As a consequence, on 20 December 2007, I arranged for the District Registrar to send a letter to the solicitors for the parties detailing those seven areas of concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The parties were then invited to make further submissions in response to those concerns, either in writing, or orally at a resumed hearing of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Ultimately I agreed to resume the hearing of the matter on 5 February 2008 so that they could make any oral submissions they wished to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In the meantime the parties lodged written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In those written submissions they indicated that after considering the concerns I had raised, they had agreed to amend the consent orders to deal with five of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Those amendments were as follows: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To refer to s 58(b) of the Trade Practices Act (Cth) rather than just s 58 in Orders 9 and 16.1, because there is a significant difference between the evidence necessary to establish a breach of s 58(b) , compared with s 58(a) ;
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">To remove the speculation about the possibility of future breaches of ss 53 and 60 of the Trade Practices Act from the last few lines of order 16.1, because neither of those sections is mentioned anywhere else in the proceedings, nor in the statement of claim;
 c. To include the word " local " between the words " untimed " and " call " in Order 12.3 to reflect the precise breach pleaded in the statement of claim and admitted in the defence;
 d. To include a new paragraph 12.6 in the consent orders to deal with the " future savings misrepresentations " pleaded in paragraphs 128 --- 129 of the statement of claim because this breach had apparently been omitted from the consent orders in error; and
 e. To delete Order 15.2 from the consent orders and include it in the undertakings, because it was too vague in its terms to be included as a part of an injunction order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">That left two matters of concern upon which the parties made further written and oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In summary, those two matters were as follows: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Whether it was necessary to adduce evidence to demonstrate that the injunctions in Order 12 were necessary ie that future contraventions were likely?</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In Order 13, whether it was desirable to treat the "no coverage " customers and the customers that have coverage, but were affected by misrepresentations about the effect of their service plans, differently?</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">On these two matters, the written submissions filed by the ACCC were to the following effect (in summary): 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The ACCC relied on s 80(4)(a) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the decisions in ICI v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at [256], Foster v ACCC [2006] FCAFC 21 at [30] and BMW Australia Ltd v ACCC [2005] FCAFC 167 at [36] to submit that the Court has a wide discretion to make the injunction orders in Order 12 once it is satisfied that contraventions of the Trade Practices Act have occurred, notwithstanding that the ACCC had not adduced direct evidence that future contraventions were likely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The ACCC submitted that Order 13 should not be amended because some customers with "no coverage " will probably not wish to terminate their service plans, therefore all customers should simply have an option to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The ACCC assured me that it would ensure the Court's orders were well publicised and the customers wishing to terminate would be given every assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">For its part, EDirect only sought to add to the ACCC's written submissions, in the following respects: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">S 80(1AA) of the Trade Practices Act (Cth) supports the grant of the injunctive orders; and
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It would not be appropriate to automatically terminate the services of all the customers who do not have coverage, because a number of those customers may have since found a use for their mobile phone e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">loaned the telephone to family members in an area with coverage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">At the resumed hearing on 5 February 2008, Mr Cox for the ACCC made some further submissions upon the question whether direct evidence of the likelihood of future breaches was necessary before the Court could make the injunction orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In summary he submitted that I should take into account the following additional matters in determining that question: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">When Mr Chopra, the third respondent, was first contacted in November 2006 by the Northern Territory Commissioner of Consumer Affairs he said EDirect would not be telemarketing in the Northern Territory in the future - yet the evidence shows that telemarketers for EDirect contacted customers in the Northern Territory after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The likelihood of detecting future breaches in relation to telemarketing is slight, particularly in remote areas, so that when a breach is detected, as occurred in this case, the full force of the law should be brought to bear, to send a clear signal that such conduct will not be tolerated in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 

 Mr Ng for EDirect did not seek to add anything to his written submissions, or to reply to the ACCC's submissions (above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Notwithstanding Mr Ng's failure to object, I have some difficulty accepting the first of these submissions because my notes indicate that this information came from Mr Cox at the Bar table rather than by way of evidence from Mr Clements, or someone else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In fact Mr Clements' affidavit does not appear to mention this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain which, if any, of the conversations between EDirect's telemarketers and various customers occurred after November 2006, because all of the records of telephone conversations annexed to Ms Vaughan's affidavit are either dated prior to November 2006, or are marked " Unknown Dates ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I will deal with the second submission and the written submissions of both parties later in these reasons when I come to consider whether it is appropriate to make orders in the terms proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">BACKGROUND 
 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Since at least February 2006 EDirect, trading under the name of VIPtel Mobile (VIPtel) has carried on a business in Australia supplying mobile telecommunications services and related equipment to consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">For that purpose VIPtel entered into an agreement with M2 Telecommunications Pty Ltd to use the Optus general service mobile (GSM) network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The coverage offered by the Optus GSM network at the relevant time is shown on the maps which comprise Appendix A to the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Those maps show that the Optus GSM network had an extensive coverage in the more heavily populated areas of Australia but that its coverage was quite limited in the more remote areas of the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Thus, in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Queensland, Western New South Wales and Central and Northern South Australia, that coverage was limited to the areas immediately surrounding the main cities and towns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">This meant, for example, that in the Northern Territory and Western Australia that coverage was limited to a very small proportion of the total land mass and it did not extend to the vast majority of the remote Aboriginal townships or communities in that Territory, and State, respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">To sell its mobile phones and the related service plans, EDirect used a direct telemarketing service which operated from call centres located in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">From there the telemarketers telephoned potential customers throughout Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Those calls usually began with the telemarketers congratulating the person answering the phone and explaining that "....within a couple of days you are going to be receiving a brand new LG flip-top, colour screen, camera, mobile phone......" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The caller then went on to obtain the necessary personal details so that by the end of the call the customer had often entered into a contract for a mobile phone service plan which, among other things, involved a sum per month being deducted from that customer's bank account and paid to EDirect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the ACCC's written submissions, Counsel aptly described this form of telemarketing in these terms: " Vulnerable consumers have an increased risk of being victims of unscrupulous conduct when it occurs over the telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Telemarketing is frequently used in the telecommunications industry to contract new customers by way of voice contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">" 
 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In this case, that unscrupulous element particularly affected those customers who lived in the areas of Australia mentioned above, which areas were not covered by the Optus GSM network, because those customers could not use the " brand new " mobile phones they received from EDirect to make telephone calls or to access any of the other services that might otherwise be available by mobile phone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">For these customers, the " brand new" mobile phones, and the related service plans they entered into, were as good as useless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">These proceedings are mainly, although not totally, concerned with various representations that were expressly or implicitly made during EDirect's telemarketing campaign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The representations fall into six categories as follows: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The coverage representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The fixed monthly payment representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">c. The included services representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">d. The future savings representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">e. The local call pricing representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">f. The any time termination representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">
 
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Between February 2006 and March 2007, the coverage representations were made to at least 152 consumers who entered into service plan contracts with EDirect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those customers, described in the statement of claim as the "no coverage customers ", were located in the following States or Territories: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">70 customers in the Northern Territory;
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">55 customers in Queensland;
 c. 7 customers in Western Australia;
 d. 17 customers in New South Wales; and
 e. 3 customers in Tasmania.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In addition to these coverage representations, between November 2006 and March 2007 EDirect made other representations about coverage by publishing on the VIPtel website various statements and a coverage map (Appendix C to the Statement of Claim).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">These publications together amounted to representations to the public at large that EDirect's mobile telephone services were available and accessible Australia-wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Apart from these two kinds of representations relating to coverage, EDirect, through its telemarketers, variously made some or all of the other five categories of representations to 14 customers (at least) who have been identified in the Statement of Claim by their Christian names and customer ID number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In summary the effect of these five other categories of representations was: 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The monthly payments on their service plans would be fixed, when in fact they fluctuated depending on usage;
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">They would be able to access various internet services with their mobile phones at no extra cost when in fact such access involved extra fees and charges;
 c. They would save on their future telephone bills when in fact they would not;
 d. They would be able to make untimed calls anywhere in Australia at local call prices when in fact they were charged at a timed rate; and
 e. They could terminate their mobile service plans at any time without any extra charge when in fact if they terminated their service plans before their terms expired there were extra charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 
 
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In its defence, EDirect has admitted that it made each of the six categories of representations (above) and that it made the representations about coverage that were published on the VIPtel website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">EDirect has also admitted that all of these representations were contrary to the true position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">For example, contrary to the representations its telemarketers made to the customer named 'Jacko', who lives in a remote Aboriginal community, that he could use the brand new mobile telephone he was to receive to make telephone calls and access various other services, in fact he could not do anything of the sort because the Optus GSM network used by EDirect did not cover his home community, nor, indeed, most of the other regional or remote communities in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">EDirect has admitted in its defence that it engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) by making these representations contrary to the true position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Further, by accepting payment for mobile service plans for mobile telecommunication services viz a connection to a network to make telephone calls or access other services, when there were reasonable grounds of which EDirect was aware, or ought reasonably have been aware, for believing that it could not provide those services, because the Optus GSM network did not cover those areas, EDirect has admitted that it engaged in conduct that was in contravention of s 58(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">
 CONSENT DECLARATIONS 
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In deciding whether to make these consent orders I must consider the content and scope of the Court's powers to make orders by consent for declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth), for injunctions under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and for compliance programs under s 86C of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I will now turn to consider each in that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">On the first, there is little doubt that the Court has a wide discretionary power to make declarations of right under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): see Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-438 and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 581-582.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">When the Court is asked to make declarations of right by consent it is required to scrutinise the orders sought to satisfy itself that it has the power to make those orders and that they are appropriate: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute Industry of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [1] and [17] and ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">2) [2002] FCA 1548 at [1] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This means that the Court has to ensure that the declaration sought is directed to determining a legal controversy and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Further the Court is required to ensure that the party seeking the declaration has a real interest in seeking that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">And, finally, the Court has to ensure that there are sufficient consequences flowing from the making of the declaration that it is appropriate for it to exercise its discretion to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">This later aspect may include the public interest in having such a declaration made to indicate the Court's disapproval of particular conduct: see ACCC v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd ( deregistered ) [2006] FCA 1534 at [8] , ACCC v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] and [34], Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No.2) (1993) 41 FCR 89 at 99 - 100 and ACCC v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 392 at [21] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Nonetheless, the Court should not impede settlements by refusing to give effect to the terms of settlements made by the parties where the proposed orders are within the Court's jurisdiction and appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In other words, the Court should be slow to substitute its own view of the orders or undertakings for those which have been agreed by the parties as part of the terms of settlement: see ACCC Real Estate Institute Western Australia (above) at [22], ACCC v Virgin Mobile Australia Pty Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">2) (above) at [2] and ACCC v Info4PC.com ( deregistered ) (above) at [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I interpolate that in my view these considerations do not prevent a court from asking the parties to reconsider certain aspects of a lengthy and complex set of proposed consent orders, as I did in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Whether this approach is warranted will obviously depend on the circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">If the proposed consent orders are fundamentally defective the court will likely reject them in total and leave the parties to start again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">However, if the proposed consent orders are generally appropriate, but they are long and complex and the court has concern about an incidental aspect of them, it would usually be more expedient and in the public interest to ask the parties to reconsider that aspect, rather than rejecting them in total.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Finally it should be noted that there is a long held view that a declaration, being a judicial act, should only be made on evidence and not simply on admissions or deemed admissions: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV Mawashi Al Gasseem (No.2) (2007 ) FCA 815 at [10] and the cases referred to therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Notwithstanding this apparent reservation, Mansfield J proceeded in that case to act on deemed admissions after referring to and considering the observations of Kiefel J in ACCC v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1427 , (2006) 236 ALR 665.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">In this case I believe I have ample reliable evidentiary material before me upon which I can make the declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Not only do I have a very detailed statement of claim setting out the facts (plus some evidentiary material) at quite some length and EDirect's defence which admits all these facts, but I also have a large quantity of evidence including the compact disc and transcripts of the voice recordings of the telemarketing calls during which EDirect's misleading and deceptive conduct occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Finally, I believe it is significant that both parties were represented by counsel at the time that all this material was prepared and during the hearing of the matter when it was placed before me by consent: see ACCC v Francis [2004] FCA 487.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Based on this material, some of which I have set out in more detail above, I am satisfied that EDirect made each of the representations to the various consumers identified in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I am also satisfied that each of the representations was misleading or deceptive in the sense that it was inconsistent with the truth: see World Series Cricket Pty Ltd v Parish (1977) 16 ALR 181 at 201.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">This conclusion applies to each of the categories of representations set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Whilst I do not propose to review all of the material relating to all of these misrepresentations, it is perhaps appropriate to observe that the most egregious aspect of EDirect's conduct was in its selling its mobile phones and service plans to people living in remote areas of Australia, including remote Aboriginal communities, when the slightest enquiry on its behalf would have disclosed that those mobile phones could not connect to the Optus GSM network because that network did not provide coverage to those remote areas of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Similar observations could be made about EDirect's conduct in publishing statements and maps on the VIPtel website which clearly conveyed the impression that Edirect was able to provide mobile phone coverage to almost all of the Australian land mass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Again, the slightest enquiry would have revealed to Edirect that this representation was quite untrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">This egregious conduct was compounded when EDirect fobbed off complaints from some of its customers living in these remote areas that they could not connect to the Optus GSM network on their new mobile phones provided by EDirect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">With one of those customers, after having made two earlier complaints by phone that his new mobile phone was showing " no service" and being told it would be alright in 24 hours, the EDirect person handling his third phone complaint gave him the somewhat disingenuous and fatuous advice that: " ...there might be possibility that you might be getting a coverage problem at your home, because there is partial coverage at your place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">So you can just go down the street, out of your house, in the street, or maybe in the roof top (my emphasis).</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">You would be getting the network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">You would be getting a bar for your mobile phone...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The ACCC has pleaded that EDirect has breached ss 52 and 58 of the Trade Practices Act by engaging in this conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">To establish a breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act it is not necessary for the ACCC to show that EDirect knew that the statements it was making were untrue and that it intended to mislead or deceive : see Geocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1268 paragraph [268], referring to Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 10 CLR 216 at 228 and to Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 197.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The situation is different under s 58(a) of the Trade Practices Act where intention is a necessary element: see Barton v Westpac Banking Corporation (1983) 76 FLR 101; (1983) 150 ALR 397 at 409 and Swann v Downes (1978) 34 FLR 36 at [46].</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">However, in this case, the ACCC has specifically relied upon s 58(b) of the Trade Practices Act which does not involve intention, but rather objective standards of reasonableness: see ACCC v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 900 at [213] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In this case, given that it was selling its mobile phone services throughout Australia, including vast remote areas of the country, it was reasonable to expect that EDirect ought to have been aware that the mobile phone services it was supplying could not provide the most fundamental thing required of the mobile phone supplied with the mobile service plan ie an ability to connect to an available network, because the Optus GSM network did not cover the whole of the Australian land mass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The fact that consumers in some parts of Australia could connect to the Optus GSM network using EDirect's mobile phones obviously does not excuse the fact that some customers in remote areas could not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In summary, based upon the whole of the material available to me I am well satisfied that this court can and should make the consent declarations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In particular, I believe that there is a real controversy between the parties, that these proceedings do not involve an abstract or hypothetical situation and that it is in the public interest that the declarations be made to mark this Court's disapproval of EDirect's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Finally, as I have already observed above, I believe there is a firm factual foundation for the declarations that are proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 CONSENT INJUNCTIONS 
 
 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Similar principles apply to the grant of consent injunctions under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act as apply to consent declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , viz the Court must be satisfied that the consent orders are within power and appropriate : see ACCC v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79, ACCC v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 , and ACCC v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 964.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The circumstances in which consent injunctions have been refused in the past are set out in ACCC v Econovite Pty Ltd (above) at [12], viz orders that are not within power, orders that have no relationship to the contravention, injunctive orders that are too imprecise or require court supervision and injunctions and declarations the terms of which overlap and give rise to confusion of obligations: see also ACCC v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (above) at [18]-[26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Following the amendment of these consent orders during the course of the hearings in this matter (as detailed above), in my view, none of these circumstances arises in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In relation to the question whether it is necessary to have evidence indicating that there are likely to be future breaches before the consent injunctions are ordered, I have considered the terms of s 80(4)(a) of the Act and three of the authorities that Mr Cox relied upon: see paragraph 10(a) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Having done so, I am well satisfied that I have a broad discretion to make the orders sought in the circumstances of this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In addition to the relevant matters I have already outlined in the reasons for my decision to grant the declaration orders (above), the other circumstances I have in mind in exercising that discretion include the fact, as Mr Cox has pointed out, that the likelihood of detection of these sorts of breaches is slight, particularly in remote areas of Australia, and for that reason the full force of the law should be brought to bear in circumstances where, as is the case here, the authorities have managed to detect such breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">On this point, at the hearing on 5 February 2008 I enquired of counsel for the parties whether there was any regulatory regime in place that required telemarketing calls of the kind involved in this case to be recorded, especially where they involve oral contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It seems likely to me that future detection would be increased if there were in place some such regulatory regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">To my surprise, my associate was subsequently informed by the solicitors for the ACCC that their research indicated that the only such regulatory measure in force in any jurisdiction in Australia was s 67D of the Fair Trading Act 1999 of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">That section requires the explicit informed consent of a person to a telemarketing agreement and also requires that explicit informed consent to be recorded either in writing, or by means of a recording device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Furthermore, I have been informed that the issue is not currently dealt with in any industry self regulatory code of practice under Pt 6 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">However, a new industry self regulatory code called the Telecommunications Consumer Protections: C 628:2007 is soon to come into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Whilst this new code does not require a voice recording to be made, it does require a record of a customer's consent to be provided " where available "; and an associated guideline document suggests that the record " can include..... a voice recording ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">All of this reinforces Mr Cox's submission that the likelihood of future detection of the sorts of breaches committed by EDirect in this case, is slight, particularly in remote areas of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">35.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">By its terms, Order 13 does not discriminate between the " no coverage " customers and those customers with coverage who were affected by the other categories of misrepresentation --- all are to be offered the option of terminating their service plans at no extra charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">My concern with this universal approach was that offering the "no coverage " customers the option to terminate may create confusion in their minds because the vast majority of them really have no option but to terminate where their mobile phones cannot connect to a network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">However, as counsel for the parties have pointed out, if all the affected customers are offered the option to terminate, the " no coverage " customers will suffer no disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Furthermore the ACCC's counsel has given an assurance that the ACCC will use its best endeavours to ensure that the terms of the Court's orders are well publicised and that the affected customers who wish to terminate are given every assistance to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In these circumstances I am prepared to make Order 13 in the terms agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">

 
 
 OTHER CONSENT ORDERS 
 
 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The terms of the community service radio broadcasts are before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In my view they have been drafted and expressed in relatively clear terms The purpose of these broadcasts is to correct the misrepresentations made by EDirect; they are not intended to punish EDirect: see ACCC v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc at [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 133.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">During the course of the hearings in this matter an issue arose as to whether the broadcasts would be effective if they were spoken in English, rather than the relevant Aboriginal language of the Aboriginal community involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The consent orders propose that all these community service broadcasts should be spoken in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The evidence in the affidavits of Mr Moon and Ms Snell discloses that for the community service broadcasts to be broadcast in Queensland, the most appropriate language is English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">However, for the community service broadcasts to be broadcast in the Northern Territory, whilst one of the four key Aboriginal languages may be desirable, English is not an inappropriate choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">In the absence of any evidence that it is inappropriate to broadcast these community service broadcasts in English in the Northern Territory, and with some reservations, I will make this order in the terms sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The consent orders also propose that EDirect enter into a compliance program pursuant to s 86C of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">For such an order to be made there needs to be a connection or relationship between the breaches of the Act and the proposed compliance program: see ACCC v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 148 ALR 339.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">In this case the compliance program is directed to ensuring that EDirect and its telemarketers comply with the guidelines for telemarketing prepared by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">In my view this provides a sufficient connection or relationship to make the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">
 CONCLUSION 
 
 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">For all these reasons it is my view that the proposed consent orders are within jurisdiction and it is appropriate that they should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">I will therefore make orders in the terms of the final amended form of consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">
