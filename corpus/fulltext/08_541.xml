4 ASIC submits that the managed investment schemes, which I have identified, were required to be registered pursuant to the provisions of subsection 601ED(1) of the Act , as each had more than 20 members and/or investors or that it was promoted by a person who was in the business of promoting managed investment schemes; s 601ED(1)(a) and s 601ED(1)(b) of the Act respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In respect of the first, second, third and fourth schemes, which are identified, ASIC contends that each was required to be registered as it was a managed investment scheme which had morel than 20 members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In respect of those managed investment schemes alleged by ASIC and which I set out numbered 5 to 10 above, ASIC contends that they were required to be registered as they were managed investment schemes promoted by a person or persons who or which were in the business of promoting managed investment schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">5 Without such registration pursuant to subsection 601ED(1) of the Act , a person must not operate the managed investment scheme; that is by virtue of subsection 601ED(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">As a fact, none of the managed investments schemes, which I have referred to, is registered as required by the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The interim relief sought by ASIC, in terms of the minute of proposed orders is sought pursuant to subsection 1324(4) of the Act to preserve the position where relevant, pending the determination of its substantive application for permanent orders pursuant to subsection 1324(1), together with subsection 601EE(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 The definition of managed investment scheme in s 9 of the Act has three features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In considering these, and whether there is a scheme, it is important to note that a scheme may start off not having each of the three features required by the definition, but may be varied over time, so that the scheme does, at some point in time, have the three required features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">By s 9 a managed investment schemes means: 
 (a) a scheme that has the following features: 
 
 
 (i) people contribute money and money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not);
 
 (ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders);
 
 (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions); and 
 
 
 
 
 
 relevantly also under subsection (e) a scheme in which all the members are bodies corporate that are related to each other and to the body corporate that promotes the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

7 I have had the benefit of very lengthy and detailed submissions filed on behalf of ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I am satisfied, on the evidence before, me that the matters which are set out between paragraph 23 and 41 inclusive of the outline of submissions, filed by ASIC, have to the requisite degree, for an application such as this, been established to my satisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I have taken illustratively the position in relation to the Lot 515, Sabrina Road, Baldivis scheme and applied the relevant evidence and the law to the other schemes mutatis mutandis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Each of the other schemes is considered in detail in those submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">8 On 8 February this year, written undertakings were given in relation to the schemes by each of the defendants with the exception of the sixth and eighth defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A copy of the undertakings may be found in the affidavit of Mr Bryan Anthony Watson sworn on 19 March 2008 at pages 931 and 932 (annexure BAW132).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The undertakings are given variously by Morag Heather McLean Fraser on her own behalf and in respect of certain of the defendants and by Kenneth Andrew Newbigging Fraser, who I understand to be her husband, in respect of himself and some other defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">9 The terms of the undertaking are not as extensive as the orders which are sought in the minute of proposed orders filed by ASIC but in essence reflect the same relief which is sought before me today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In particular, the relevant defendants undertook: 
 1. .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">2. to refrain from to publishing, distributing, disseminating or otherwise circulating any "EOI" or any other document in furtherance of the scheme save for information to investors about the terms of this undertaking and the foreshadowed application by ASIC to wind up the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I understand from counsel that "EOI" is an abbreviation for "Expressions of Interest"; 3. until further agreement with ASIC, that each scheme manager would refrain, whether by themselves or their officers, servants, employees, agents or otherwise howsoever from receiving, soliciting, disposing, or causing to be paid or transferred any funds in connection with or further to the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">4. .</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">5. not to encumber or otherwise deal directly or indirectly with any real or personal property of or funds held by a schemes manager for or in connection with the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">6. .</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">10 Counsel for ASIC has directed my attention to a number of instances, where I am satisfied again to the requisite degree, given the nature of the present application, that there is a serious concern that a number of those undertakings may have been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There is a concern as to whether the investors have been kept informed and perhaps even misinformed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I refer, for example, to the position in relation to communications by the first defendant concerning the installation of sewerage at Lot 515 Sabrina Road, Baldivis and the position which is reflected in a letter from the Water Corporation in reply to Mr Boase, who had written concerning that matter, having received a letter from the first defendant which had given him cause for suspicion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The letter, which appears at page 941 of Mr Watson's affidavit and which is dated 19 February 2008, on its face, may well be a breach of undertakings numbers 2 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">11 Then, in the West Australian Newspaper for 15 March 2008, there appeared an advertisement by Ron Farris Real Estate Pty Ltd in relation to the sale of 35-38 residential lots of the land at 13 Sabrina Road, Baldivis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I was advised that this was the street address for the Land at Lot 515 Sabrina Road, Baldivis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Furthermore, a printed brochure seeking expressions of interest in relation to that land was provided by Ron Farris Real Estate to Mr Boase on 18 March this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Individually, or in combination, those, it would appear, may well be breaches of undertaking number 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">12 There were other examples of possible breaches in the undertakings to which I was taken by counsel for ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It is unnecessary, presently, to go to each of these for the purposes of the application before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Nonetheless, generically, the court does have a very real concern, not only that some of the written undertakings given by those defendants who gave them may well have been breached but also that Mr Ken Fraser, it would appear, and putting it no higher at this stage, has made statements which are at odds with the content of other documents, including, for example, whether or not the first defendant is involved in one of the schemes or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">So, I am well satisfied that, by reference to the criteria contained in s 9 of the Act as to what constitutes a managed investment scheme, in each case a serious issue has been demonstrated by the applicant, that they are unregistered managed investment schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">13 I have no hesitation in concluding that, on the balance of convenience, the orders ought to be made to preserve the position in relation to each of the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The scheme of the Act concerning managed investment schemes includes, necessarily and obviously, provision for the regulation of those schemes and to thereby confer appropriate protection for investors in the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Court simply does not know what damage, if any, or what loss, if any, investors may or may not have been occasioned by their investment in these unregistered schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">When I say that, I say that provisionally, of course, on the basis of this being an ex parte interlocutory application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">14 I will, subject to some minor amendments, make orders in terms of ASIC's minute of proposed orders for 10 April 2008 forming part of which is annexure A which sets out the several schemes to which the orders in the minute refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Associate:
