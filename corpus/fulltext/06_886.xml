 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The appellant is a citizen of Serbia and Montenegro of Albanian Muslim descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He comes from a village in Preshevo, Serbia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He arrived in Australia in December 2003 and applied for a protection visa in January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The appellant's application for a protection visa was refused by a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">This decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant's application for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZEPN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2005] FMCA 1664).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The Tribunal in its written reasons for decision noted that the appellant claims that he will face harm if he returns to Serbia and Macedonia because he avoided conscription and because he assisted Kosovo refugees flee to Montenegro during the war between Kosovo and Serbia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant does not challenge the Tribunal's conclusion that he would not now face harm in his country of nationality because he avoided conscription.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">However, he continues to maintain that he will face harm as a Muslim who assisted Kosovo refugees during the war between Kosovo and Serbia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The appellant has appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For the reasons set out below, I conclude that his appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THIS APPEAL 
 
5 This appeal has had an unhappy procedural history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 First, the appellant required an extension of time within which to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">His solicitor swore an affidavit in support of the application for an extension of time in which he deposed to attempting to send a notice of appeal to the NSW District Registry of this Court by facsimile transmission within the time allowed by O 52 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It appears that he did not wait to sight a transmission verification report before departing overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The transmission verification report annexed to the solicitor's affidavit shows that the fax number to which the solicitor attempted to send the notice of appeal was busy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This is perhaps fortunate as the number shown on the transmission verification report is not a Federal Court number; one digit was wrongly entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 On 17 March 2006 this Court ordered that the time within which the appellant could file and serve a notice of appeal be extended up to and including 24 March 2006 ( SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 268).</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 No notice of appeal was filed in the period between 17 and 24 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It appears that an attempt was made to file a notice of appeal on 29 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Registry properly refused to accept the notice for filing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 The respondent thereupon consented to the period of time within which the appellant could file and serve a notice of appeal being further extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">A notice of appeal was filed and served within the further extended period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 Only one ground of appeal is set out in the notice of appeal filed by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That ground asserts that the learned Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error because it 'overlooked' a single passage in the independent material available to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The passage in the independent material to which this ground of appeal refers can be identified by reference to the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate (at [19]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is an extract from the US State Department Report on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal was justified in not referring to that passage because it instead placed reliance on a passage dealing with the same subject matter in the 2003 version of the same report (at [23]-[24]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 I conducted a direction hearing in respect of this appeal on 30 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On that day I ordered that the appeal book be filed and served by the solicitor for the appellant 14 days ahead of the hearing date fixed for the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I also ordered that the appellant file and serve any further written submissions by no later than five clear working days before the hearing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Neither of these orders was complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The appeal book was filed and served four days ahead of the hearing date fixed for the appeal and the appellant's written submissions were filed only 2 clear working days ahead of that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant's solicitor, who appeared on his behalf both in this Court and in the Federal Magistrates Court, indicated that he wished to amend the notice of appeal --- although he was not able to provide the Court, or the respondent, with a draft of the amendments he wished to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Ultimately it emerged that the appellant, perhaps unsurprisingly, wished to abandon reliance on the only ground of appeal set out in his notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">13 In lieu of the ground of appeal set out in his notice of appeal the appellant wished to rely on grounds of appeal to the following effect:
 
 (a) the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by referring the appellant to independent evidence which it wrongly characterised as indicating that Serbian forces had withdrawn from Preshevo; and (b) the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by overlooking certain passages in the independent evidence which were corroborative of the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

14 Neither of the above arguments was advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">No evidence was adduced to explain why the arguments were not advanced below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The appellant's solicitor simply advised the Court that he 'missed' the arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The initial application for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal had been supported by an affidavit to which a draft of the appellant's notice of appeal had been annexed (see O 52 r 15(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It was not argued before me, and it is in any event unnecessary for me to determine, whether the appellant would require a fresh extension of time to allow him to file and serve a notice of appeal raising entirely new grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">SHOULD LEAVE BE GRANTED TO ADVANCE NEW ARGUMENTS?</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
15 An appellant requires the appellate court's leave to rely on arguments not advanced before the court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That leave will only be granted where it is expedient in the interests of justice for the leave to be granted ( NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 esp at [163]-[166]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In NAJT at [166] Madgwick J identified the relevant questions as including the following:
 
 '1) Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 
 2) Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below?</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 3) How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 4) What is at stake in the case for the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 5) Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand?</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured?</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie?</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">' 
 
 
 

16 The serious consequences that may attend a wrongful refusal of a protection visa may be taken into account in determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice for leave to be granted in a case of this kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">However, the authorities reveal that leave is less likely to be granted where the appellant has been legally represented at all times ( Wimalaratne v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1737 (FC); Iyer v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 (FC)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">17 I heard the parties in full on the merit of the grounds of appeal on which the appellant wishes to rely, as well as on the question of whether leave should be granted to the appellant to rely on them as they do not reflect arguments made to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I considered it appropriate to adopt this course because the merit of the arguments is a significant consideration in determining whether it is expedient in the interests of justice to grant the appellant leave to rely on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I reserved ruling on the application to amend the notice of appeal until the publication of these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT 
 Proposed Ground 1 
 
18 The reasons for decision of the Tribunal, after referring to the appellant's claim to fear harm because he avoided conscription, state:
 
 'The applicant then said that he feared harm because he had helped Kosovar refugees to flee and had escorted them to Macedonia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Tribunal referred to the independent evidence as set out in the primary decision maker's decision, and the independent evidence cited below, which indicated that hostilities were at an end and that Serbian forces had withdrawn from Preshevo .</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Moreover, free and fair elections had been held to form a government representative of the local population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Tribunal asked in the light of this, why he should still be afraid to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">' (emphasis added)
 

19 The appellant contended that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by suggesting to the appellant that the independent evidence indicated that Serbian forces had withdrawn from Preshevo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I do not accept this submission; no jurisdictional error is involved in the Tribunal's seeking an applicant's comments on the Tribunal's understanding of the independent evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The position might be different if it were established that the Tribunal based its decision on a wrong understanding of the independent evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">20 Later in the Tribunal's reasons for decision the following passage appears:
 
 'The Tribunal accepts the independent evidence cited above and cited in the primary decision maker's record, that the situation in Preshevo has changed such that people like the applicant are no longer oppressed by Serbians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">' 
 

21 The above passage, when read together with the passage set out in [18] above, suggests that the Tribunal accepted the independent evidence to which it referred in the belief that that evidence indicated that 'Serbian forces' had withdrawn from Preshevo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Was this a wrong understanding?</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">22 The independent evidence does not contain a statement that 'Serbian forces had withdrawn from Preshevo' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However, it may be inferred from the independent evidence that, as hostilities are at an end, Serbian military forces are no longer in the region as an active fighting force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It may also be inferred from the independent evidence that there are now no exclusively Serbian forces in the region, as opposed to ethnically diverse forces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Certainly the independent evidence suggests that civil order in the Preshevo region is now maintained by the new multi-ethnic police force rather than by Serbian military forces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">23 The reasons for decision of the Tribunal should not be scrutinised over-zealously ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 272).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is not entirely clear what the Tribunal meant by the expression 'Serbian forces' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, when the reasons for decision of the Tribunal are read as a whole, I do not consider that they suggest that the Tribunal misunderstood the independent evidence to which it referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The Tribunal rightly looked to that evidence to see what light, if any, it threw on the question of whether the appellant had a real chance of being harmed by Serbian authorities should he return to his country of nationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I think it likely that the Tribunal intended to convey that the exclusively Serbian military forces which the appellant feared were no longer responsible for maintaining order in Preshevo; for that reason the appellant would be able to look to the multi-ethnic police force for protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">This view of the situation in Preshevo finds support in the independent evidence to which the Tribunal referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">24 The independent evidence to which the Tribunal referred was fairly characterised by it as revealing that the situation in Preshevo has changed and that ethnic Albanians are no longer oppressed by Serbians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">For example, the primary decision-maker noted that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had advised:
 
 '... the FRY Government has endeavoured to redress Albanian grievances in Presevo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Albanians are included in administrative and political structures including in a new multi-ethnic police force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Municipal elections in July 2002 returned Albanian mayors in two out of three municipalities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is considerable international presence in Presevo, which keeps the actions of the authorities under scrutiny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In short, there is no reason for Albanians from Presevo to fear returning unless, of course, they have committed some genuine criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">' 
 

25 I conclude that this proposed ground of appeal has limited prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Proposed Ground 2 
 
26 As mentioned above, the appellant's notice of appeal asserted that the Federal Magistrate had erred by failing to find that the Tribunal had made a jurisdictional error by overlooking one passage in the independent material available to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Counsel for the Minister thus attended the hearing of this appeal prepared to defend the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court against criticism of its treatment of the appellant's arguments concerning that passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">27 However, as is also mentioned above, the appellant did not press that ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Rather the appellant sought to advance a new argument, not made to the Federal Magistrates Court, based on other content of the independent material available to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">28 The appellant's written submissions on the appeal contained as an annexure sixty pages of independent evidence from the 2003 US State Department Report mentioned in [10] above, with certain passages highlighted in green to indicate that the Tribunal referred to them and others in pink to indicate that the Tribunal did not refer to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It appears that this coloured highlighting did not appear in the copy submissions provided to the respondent's legal representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The single passage to which the appellant's notice of appeal must be understood to refer was not one of the highlighted passages; that passage is contained in the 2001 version of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">29 I have examined the passages highlighted in pink.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">They indicate that at the time with which the report was concerned, human rights abuses to some degree continued in Serbia and Montenegro generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They also indicate that poverty and unemployment were highest in southern Serbia and amongst refugees and displaced persons from Kosovo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Some of the passages have little, if any, relevance to the situation in Preshevo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Importantly, the passages highlighted in pink do not contradict the material upon which the Tribunal placed reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">They do not suggest that it was inappropriate for the Tribunal to conclude, as it did, that there was no reason why the local authorities, who are now representative of the local population and no longer represent the former Milosevic regime, would be interested in the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">30 I consider that this proposed ground of appeal has no realistic prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">CONCLUSION 
 
31 Having regard, in particular, to my above findings as to the merits of the two proposed grounds of appeal, I conclude that it is not expedient in the interests of justice to allow the appellant to rely on those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The additional factors to which I give weight are that the appellant has been legally represented at all material times, that no satisfactory explanation has been advanced for the proposed grounds of appeal being identified for the first time at the appeal hearing and the apparently cavalier manner in which the appellant's case has been conducted in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The application to amend the notice of appeal is therefore refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">32 As the only ground contained in the notice of appeal was understandably not pressed, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson.</sentence>
