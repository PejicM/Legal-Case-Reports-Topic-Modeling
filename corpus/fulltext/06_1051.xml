 1 On 30 March 2006 a Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for review due to the failure of the applicant to appear pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Reasons were given for that decision which set out a history of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant for leave, who was the applicant in that matter, then sought a review of that decision and applied to set it aside pursuant to r 16.05 of the Federal Magistrates Courts Rules 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant explained the failure to appear by asserting confusion as to the hearing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The Federal Magistrate who heard that application did not accept the applicant's version of events and did not accept that there was any proper explanation of the failure to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This was fatal to the application to set aside the earlier dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, the learned Federal Magistrate went on to express the opinion that, in any event, the applicant had not shown that there was a case fit to be tried on the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 The jurisdiction of this Court in a matter of this kind, which involves the practice and procedure of the Federal Magistrates Court, is to correct errors of law or errors of principle that occur at the level of that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Leave to appeal is not granted unless such error is arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Having read each of the decisions of the learned Federal Magistrate I can detect no error of principle in what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Each matter was dealt with in a perfectly orthodox manner according to well established principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">There would be no possibility, in my opinion, of any appeal to this Court being successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Leave to appeal is therefore refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 It should be noted that the consequence of this decision is that the applicant has not had any hearing on the merits of her application to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It is also to be noted that the Refugee Review Tribunal decision, which is the decision that she wished to challenge, in fact arose out of that Tribunal refusing to exercise jurisdiction because application to it had been made one day late.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The consequence is that the applicant has never had her case heard on the merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is not the task of this Court to give legal advice or to make any further comment on the matter beyond saying that, if the applicant does have a case with some underlying merit, then she should, as a matter of urgency, seek legal advice to ascertain whether or not there is any way of bringing fresh proceedings to have her case tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The application for leave is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant must pay the costs of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
