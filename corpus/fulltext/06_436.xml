 APPLICATION 
 
 1 Alfred Switson Mundraby and Vincent Mundraby, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Mandingalbay Yidinji People, have applied pursuant to the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the "Act") for a determination that native title exists over certain land and waters near Yarrabah and around Trinity Inlet and the Mulgrave River in the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In these reasons the word "waters" is used with the meaning attributed to it by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The word "water" is used with the meaning attributed to it by the Water Act (2000) (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">BACKGROUND 
 
2 This application was first lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal ("the Tribunal") on 4 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 30 September 1998, by force of amendments to the Act, all applications lodged with the Tribunal became proceedings filed in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 18 October 1999 the Court ordered that the application be combined with application QG 6094 of 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 8 October 2004, the Court amended the application by removing land and waters south of Bells Peak South from the area previously claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The subject land and waters are hereinafter referred to as the "determination area", which term has the meaning attributed to it in Schedule 1 to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It comprises six separate "parcels".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Those parcels will eventually be described as lots 1 to 6 on AP 9675 and are hereinafter referred to by such lot numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 The applicant claims that the Mandingalbay Yidinji people traditionally owned a much larger area which included those six lots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">However they accept that native title over parts of that area has been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Other parts are subject to joint claims by the Mandingalbay Yidinji people and the Gunggandji people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The boundaries of the six lots have been drawn to exclude those parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In Schedule 2 the six lots are divided into Parts A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Part A contains lots 2, 3 and 4 which comprise unassigned Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Part B contains lots 1, 5 and 6 which comprise land appropriated for particular purposes not inconsistent with the continued non-exclusive use of, and access to, it by native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The Tribunal gave notice of the application pursuant to, and in accordance with, s 66 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Pursuant to s 84(3) of the Act, the State of Queensland, Cairns City Council, Cairns Port Authority, Ergon Energy Corporation Limited and Telstra Corporation Limited were joined, and remain, as parties to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">One hundred and thirty-nine other persons, categorised as indigenous people, professional fishers, irrigation and water supply recipients and tourist operators, were also joined as parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">They have all since withdrawn from the proceedings by giving written notice pursuant to s 84(6) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">On 30 September 1998 the application was referred to the Tribunal for mediation pursuant to s 86B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The parties have reached agreement upon the terms of a draft determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The agreement recognises the traditional rights of the Mandingalbay Yidinji People in relation to the determination area (except in relation to water) to:
 
 (a) possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of all land and waters in Part A of Schedule 2 (comprising lots 2, 3 and 4), to the exclusion of all others; 
 (b) in relation to all land and waters in Part B of Schedule 2 (comprising lots 1, 5 and 6), the non-exclusive right to use and enjoy the land and waters, being the right to: 
 
 
 (i) access and be physically present thereon in accordance with traditional laws and customs;
 (ii) camp thereon in accordance with traditional laws and customs, not including the right to reside permanently or to build permanent structures or fixtures;
 (iii) hunt, fish and gather thereon for the purpose of satisfying personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs;
 (iv) take, use and enjoy the natural resources thereof for the purpose of satisfying personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs;
 (v) maintain and protect from physical harm, by lawful means, places therein which are of importance to the native title holders in accordance with traditional laws and customs;
 (vi) perform social, cultural, religious, spiritual and ceremonial activities thereon and invite others to participate in those activities in accordance with traditional laws and customs; and 
 
 
 (c) in relation to all land and waters in Part B of Schedule 2 (comprising lots 1, 5 and 6) non-exclusive rights to: 
 
 
 (i) pass on native title in relation thereto in accordance with traditional laws and customs;
 (ii) make decisions in accordance with traditional laws and customs concerning access thereto and use and enjoyment thereof by aboriginal people who are governed by the traditional laws acknowledged, and traditional customs observed by, the native title holders; and
 (iii) determine membership and filiation to the native title holders in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 

5 In relation to all water in the determination area the agreement recognizes the non-exclusive right to:
 
 
 (a) use, enjoy, hunt on, fish and gather from the water for personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes, and
 (b) take and use the water and its resources for personal domestic, social, religious, cultural, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes;
 provided that, in all such cases, the purpose is non-commercial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 

6 It is agreed that such native title is subject to, and exercisable in accordance with:
 
 (a) the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Queensland, including local laws and planning instruments;
 (b) traditional laws acknowledged, and traditional customs observed, by the native title holders; and
 (c) other interests in relation to the determination area as set out in Schedule 4 to this order, the relationship between the native title and those other interests being that: 
 
 
 (i) such other interests continue to have effect, and the rights conferred by, or held thereunder may be exercised, notwithstanding the existence of the native title, and
 (ii) such other interests and any activity done in exercise of the rights conferred thereby or held thereunder, prevail over the native title and any exercise of the native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 

7 It is further agreed that there is no native title in or in relation to:
 
 (a) minerals as defined in the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld); or
 (b) petroleum as defined in the Petroleum Act 1923 (Qld) and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">

8 The parties seek orders in, or consistent with, the terms of their agreement, provided that the Court is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so: s 87 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">POWER OF THE COURT 
 
9 Pursuant to s 13 and Pts 3 and 4 of the Act, the Court may make determinations concerning native title in relation to areas over which there is no existing approved determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Division 1C of Pt 4 of the Act provides that some or all of the parties to native title proceedings may negotiate an agreed outcome for an application or part thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Section 87 of the Act empowers the Court, if it is satisfied that such an order is within its power, to make an order in, or consistent with, the terms of the parties' agreement without holding a full hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Where the Court makes a determination of native title, s 94A of the Act requires that it set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225 which provides: 
 
 'A determination of native title is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area ) of land or waters and, if it does exist, a determination of: 
 
 
 (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and 
 (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this Act); and 
 (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease --- whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">' 
 
 
 
 EVIDENCE 
 
10 I have examined the anthropological and genealogical report prepared by Professor Bruce Rigsby, consultant anthropologist and a helpful summary of Professor Rigsby's report, contained in several affidavits sworn by Michael Hugh Southon, Director of Research-Anthropology with the North Queensland Land Council Native Title Representative Body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">11 Mr Southon records that:
 
 'The Mandingalbay Yidinji claimant group describe themselves as the descendants of the man known as "Jabulum Mandingalpai", usually spelt now as "Yabalum Mandingalbay", and as Jimmy in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Yabalam and his wife Biddie had four children, who were, in birth order, Tommy Read, Maggie Mundraby, Fred Mundraby and Amy Hyde, but the spokesmen for the current group are a sub-set of Fred Mundraby's descendants, namely, Basil Vincent Mundraby (aka Vincent Mundraby Sr), his nephew Alf Mundraby and his son Vincent Mark ("Boy") Mundraby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They know that their family name "Mundraby" has its origins in the missionaries' attempts to pronounce and write the indigenous personal name, Mandi Ngarrbay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">(Rigsby 2002:171 ) 
 
 Tindale's Yarrabah genealogy sheet 5 recorded Yabalam as a Yidinyji man "Idinji Trfibe], of Dumbunji", which is Site 26 in the connection report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Dumbunji, or Mount Gorton, lies in the Murray Prior Range, 3 kilometres north-east of the northernmost point of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">(Rigsby 2002:171) 
 
 Tindale's Sociology Card #611 for Yabalam's son, the first Fred Mundraby (cl883-1945), recorded Fred's birthplace as "oombunghi - n. Yarrabah Qu", and his physical anthropology measurements card #611 also recorded Fred's birthplace as "Dumbunji".</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Birdsell's Yarrabah genealogy sheets El and X-5 recorded Yabalam's and Fred's relationship, but not their place of birth or origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Dixon (1991a:132, 134 and elsewhere) identified Ngumbunji as the Yidiny / Yidiy language name for Mount Gorton, so the straightforward interpretation is to take this as evidence for the two men's connection to the Mount Gorton area, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">to the mountain itself and to its associated country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">(Rigsby 2002:171) 
 
 There were the following groups of people at Yarrabah in the early years following the 1897 Act: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Gungganyji people (with their children), who were the traditional owners of the land where the central mission site was situated, as well as the eastern portion of the Reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Yidinyji people (with their children), some of whom were the ancestors of the current Mandingalbay Yidinji claimant group; they were traditional owners on the western portion of the Reserve (Rigsby 2002:113).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 
 
 Dr Powell found information in Ernest Gribble's diaries that located Fred Mundraby, one of Yabalam's four children, at the mission from its beginning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">On Wednesday, May 22, 1893, Gribble wrote: 
 
 "Today found a little boy (Fred) sick at the camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Had him removed to my room and attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">His mother (as is their custom in times of illness) cut a vein on the top of his head to bleed him with a piece of glass and cut too much and the poor little fellow lost a great quantity of blood before we could manage to stop the flow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He is in consequence of the great loss of blood very weak.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I laid him on my bed and a cup of hot tea and a piece of bread and jam soon made the little chap feel better but it was a narrow escape from bleeding to death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">" (Rigsby 2002:179).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 "This child was surely the first Fred Mundraby, as Dr Powell and Rigsby found only one "Fred" in the records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Furthermore, Fred Mundraby's personal information card (in the Menmuny Museum) listed his birth year as about 1883, which made him about ten years old at the time of his illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">" (Rigsby 2002:180)' 
 

12 Mr Southon continues:
 
 'The Mundrabys identify themselves as Yidinyji people, and they further name themselves as Mandingalbay Yidinji people, where Mandingalbay is a personal name which has been handed down to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Sometimes they and others describe themselves as the Mandingalbay "clan" group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">(Rigsby 2002:182) 
 
 Rigsby states that from his knowledge of the classical ethnography of the region and what he knows from elsewhere on Cape York Peninsula, it is unlikely that Mandingalbay was in the past both a clan name and a personal name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He is confident, however, that it was a personal name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">(Rigsby 2002:182) 
 
 Rigsby nonetheless believes that the Mandingalbay Yidinji claimant group does represent the continuation of an older clan group, namely, the Yidinyji clan group which Stan Connolly called the Manggarra Yidinyji - Connolly (n.d.3, n.d.4, n.d. 8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(Rigsby 2002:182).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 The Manggarra Yidinyji were and are the immediate western neighbours of Gungganyji people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">When Yabalam, his wife Biddie and their son Fred came in to the old mission site across the Range, they did not come as strangers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Manggarra Yidinyji people who came in were not refugees from the Atherton Tableland or some other distant place: they were the next-door neighbours, and they were relations of Minminiy and other Gungganyji people who were the traditional owners of the country around the mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">(Rigsby 2002:182).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 Although Mundraby spokesmen told Dr Sackett in 1995 that they owned their traditional lands and waters through patrilineal inheritance, Rigsby has concluded that this was an ideologised representation of culture, an attempt to present the contemporary group as conforming to the popular view of what classical social organisation was like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">(Rigsby 2002:182) 
 
 In 2001 Rigsby asked the claimants whether their daughters' children were strangers who had no rights in their land, and the answer he received was no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Rigsby told them that their omission from the earlier genealogy meant that they were not members of their claimant group, that they would not share in the benefits to be gained by a native title consent determination, and suggested that the genealogy should be expanded to include all descendants of Yabalam, which the claimants agreed with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">(Rigsby 2002:182) 
 
 On the basis of what claimants told Rigsby, he defines their system of tenure and ownership as based on cognatic descent, where membership in the group is traced through both men and women from some one or more apical ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">(Rigsby 2002:182)' 
 

13 Mr Southon continues:
 
 The expert Anthropologist's report describes four key facets of Mandingalbay Yidinji proprietary relationship to the land: 
 
 a) beneficial right to the land and its resources 
 b) responsibility for the maintenance of the land 
 
 
 c) the claimants' group identities are an intrinsic part of the proprietary relationship with the land 
 d) right to acquire ownership of land through descent and to transmit ownership of land to descendants 
 
 
 
 On the basis of these four aspects of Mandingalbay Yidinji proprietary relationship to the land, the report divides Mandingalbay Yidinji native title rights and interests into four categories that flow from these four aspects of their land tenure: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Occupation and Economic Rights 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Control and Management Rights 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Cultural Property Rights 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Membership and Dispute Settlement Rights 
 
 The native title rights and interests listed in the Determination correspond to the these four categories of rights in the following way: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Occupation and Economic Rights 
 
 i) the right to access and be physically present upon the Determination Area in accordance with traditional laws and customs; 
 
 ii) the right to camp on the Determination Area in accordance with traditional laws and customs which does not include the right to permanently reside or build permanent structures or fixtures; 
 
 iii) the right to hunt, fish and gather on the Determination Area for the purpose of satisfying their personal, domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs; 
 
 iv) the right to take, use and enjoy the Natural Resources of the Determination Area for the purpose of satisfying their personal, domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs; 
 
 x) use, enjoy, hunt on and fish and gather from the Water for personal, domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes; and 
 
 xi) take and use the Water and its resources for personal, domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Control and Management Rights 
 
 iv) the right to maintain and protect from physical harm, by lawful means, places within the Determination Area of importance to the Native Title Holders in accordance with traditional laws and customs: and 
 
 viii) make decisions in accordance with traditional laws and customs about the access, use and enjoyment of the Determination Area by Aboriginal People who are governed by the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the Native Title Holders; and 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Cultural Property Rights 
 
 vi) the right to perform social, cultural, religious, spiritual or ceremonial activities on the Determination Area and invite others to participate in those activities in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Membership and Dispute Settlement Rights 
 
 vii) pass on native title rights and interests in relation to the Determination Area in accordance with traditional laws and customs 
 
 ix) determine membership of and filiation to the native title holding group in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 

14 Mr Southon continues:
 
 'As the expert Anthropologist notes, these are the most straightforward of the rights and interests which flow from the proprietary-beneficial right and include the right to live on and erect residences on the claim area and the right to a portion of the benefit of resources taken by others from the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">(Rigsby 2002:205) 
 
 He also notes that "unlike many other Aboriginal groups, (the Mandingalbay Yidinji) were not removed from their homelands to other regions and despite the authoritarian control to which they were subjected at times by the missionaries and the state native affairs department in previous periods, many, if not most, of their members have always lived on, camped, hunted, gathered, fished and ranged over their traditional lands and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" (Rigsby 2002:211) 
 
 He testifies to the fact that "many of the Gungganyji and Mandingalbay Yidinji claimants reside on their homelands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Others visit their country on a regular, e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">weekly basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">They know particular places in the country by their indigenous language names and they use them, not English names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">And although they no longer produce all their living and other needs from their own land, hunting, fishing and gathering remain important and meaningful pursuits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Claimants continue to use indigenous language names for many plants and animals, particularly for those species which are edible or used in making artefacts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Moreover, parents and grandparents pass on knowledge of traditional resources and techniques of taking or manufacturing them to their children and grandchildren".</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">(Rigsby 2002:56).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">
 
 In 2004, Mandingalbay Yidinji claimant Alfred Mundraby made the following statements in support of continuing economic rights of Mandingalbay Yidinji people in the claim area: 
 
 "Fred and I went up there (to the State Forest) about six months ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">There had been a fire and we went hunting after the fire to get food for our families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">While we were there we were visiting this cave there, there are two caves up high on the ridges, we had to go and check it out and make sure it hadn't been disturbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">We go round, especially after a fire when access is easier, and we check out the caves and landmarks and the middens left by our old people and we manage our interests in this way, we look after the forest and that's how Murris manage it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">We check the damage the fire has done to our land, our caves, our animals and lakes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">" 
 
 "When I used to get the cassowaries up there with the old fellow, where the cassowaries dropped he'd burn it where it dropped, where he's speared it, later on where he shot it, burn all the hair off it, right there, you know cassowaries have hair not really feathers, that's the Yidinji way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Then we'd clean it out right there too, gut it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">We'd make afire right there along side it to burn the hair off and gut it, then we'd carry it home to have a big feast, lots of Mandingalbay Yidinji families at that feast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">I've gone that a lot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Made a fire on the banks of a creek that they run down to after they get shot, and fall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Where the cassowaries run to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Then carried them back to Buddabaddoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">" ... 
 
 Another claimant, Fred Mundraby, also offered testimony as to continuing exercise of economic rights in the claim area: 
 
 "We like to hunt porcupines (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">echidna) bandicoots, turkeys, birds, rock wallabies there's plenty of tucker in our country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">We can live and camp out there for days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">" 
 
 ... 
 
 Each generation of the claimant groups from the time of the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty has enjoyed access to the claimed land through the present time by and large unimpeded by others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">For each such generation, the majority of members of the claimant group lived on the land and had access to other parts of the land by foot and canoe, and now also by motor vehicles, power boats and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The majority of members of the claimant group in each generation have lived continuously within the claim area since its inception in 1893 as an Aboriginal mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">(Rigsby 2002:212) 
 
 The claimants regard their responsibility for land as an indivisible aspect of their rights and interests in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Indeed, rights are so strongly allied to responsibility that people with the strongest traditional-customary rights in an area often make their initial up-front statement of ownership in such terms as "We are the people who look after that area".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">(Rigsby 2002:205) 
 
 For example, members of the Mandingalbay Yidinji claimant group expressed their concern to Prof. Rigsby about the actions of a road construction crew which several years ago opened up an area with a bulldozer to excavate fill for repairing the road between Jilji and Buddabadoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The excavation was immediately next to the widely known Shield Rock / Walba Bigun site, which lies outside the claim area but is part of Mandingalbay Yidinji traditional country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Had it been extended a bit further, could have dislodged the large boulder and caused it to roll down the hill onto the roadway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">But more importantly, Mandingalbay Yidinji people considered that the actions of the construction crew might have disturbed and upset the Story-Woman who lives there and the spirits of the Old People who look after the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Their statements not only expressed deep ties of sentiment to the land, but also their sense of responsibility to it Rigsby reports that a confrontation took place in which the Mandingalbay Yidinji native title holders sought to assert their rights with force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">(Rigsby 2002:205) 
 
 Apart from resource protection, the management of country involves such matters as approaching sites in the correct manner prescribed by traditional law and custom specific to them so as to avoid giving offence to the spirits of these sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Examples include the proper introduction of strangers to the sites, and the avoidance of loud or disrespectful conduct at them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Proper introduction may require the traditional owners to "talk Language" and introduce the visitors to the spirits there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">An improper approach may threaten the community and the traditional owners by antagonising and aggravating the spirits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">But sites are seen also as resources themselves, the sources of the spiritual power responsible for the maintenance of the land and the social order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">(Rigsby 2002:205) 
 
 In regard to fire, the Mandingalbay Yidinji share the widespread Cape York Peninsula view that traditional law and custom oblige traditional owners or aboriginal title-holders to keep their country "clean" (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">with open vistas of grass, free of undergrowth, etc.).</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Claimants frequently say that they do this to promote the growth of new grass for wallabies and other species, but they also acknowledge they do it as much so for aesthetic reasons (Rigsby 2002:206).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">
 
 The use of fire is subject to customary restrictions as to who directs it, the amount of country which should be burned at any one time (a limited area, with the object of producing a mosaic patchwork of burned and unburned areas) and the times of year when firing is to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">(Rigsby 2002:206) 
 
 "Marking or changing" the claim area includes the marking of rock faces, the construction of private roads, tracks and dwellings, the removal or modification of vegetation, and the removal of soil materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Marking the land is something the claimants believe that "Stories" / Ancestral Beings did during the Story-Time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The rich regional oral literature recounts the deeds of many Story-Beings as they fashioned the landscape and its topographic features, and the traditional owners consider that their prerogative of marking and changing the landscape comes to them by their descent from the Stories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Marking the landscape perhaps carries some deeper meanings, especially cutting the surface, given that the soil is, in a diffuse sense, identified with the Ancestral Beings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">(Rigsby 2002:207) 
 
 Apart from the significance in itself of cutting the surface, the cutting of roads and tracks and the clearing of vegetation is also related to a concern that such activities might intrude upon or damage Story-Places and burial sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Recall Rigsby's remarks about the road construction crew taking fill from near Walba Bigun "Shield Rock".</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">(Rigsby 2002:207) 
 
 The right to control the access, occupation, use and enjoyment of any part of the claim area by others is a traditional one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The available historical record prior to population reduction during the colonial period indicates that owners displayed very low tolerance for people intruding into their lands and using their resources without permission or some prior understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Today the Mandingalbay Yidinji and fellow Aboriginal Yarrabah residents still exercise such control as they can over their homelands by insisting that Aboriginal non-owners ask for permission, and, in turn, they reinforce their traditional ownership by recognising and respecting other groups' property rights in land by refraining from trespass and intrusion on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">(Rigsby 2002:207)'

<sentence id="s133">Griffin, the Yarrabah Superintendent, wrote that: 
 
 "Within the borders of the Yarrabah Aboriginal Reserve,... there is yet much of the old ways that is pure, and has been preserved by these people in their own dialect, in their songs, and to some extent in their dances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Similarly, there are the songs, dances, and the language of the neighbouring Yedtinji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Their legends are kept before them by the various physical manifestations of the stories which they serve to explain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Like all Aboriginal people they have maintained very close bonds with their tribal lands, lands which are full of spiritual significance for them, were painted in cave-drawings by their forefathers, and were explained and glorified in legend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">" (Rigsby 2002:55) 
 
 Rigsby concurs with Griffin's view: "The impact of over a century of colonisation and close missionary and state native affairs department control cannot be disregarded, but neither should ongoing social and cultural continuity be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The claimants and their neighbours may no longer act and believe just as their ancestors did, but they by no means have abandoned or lost all that which their ancestors held dear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Importantly, they retain strong attachments of belief and emotion to their traditional lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Indeed, it is in regard to land that they actively and clearly express and demonstrate traditional beliefs and practices".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">(Rigsby 2002:56) 
 
 In the traditional law and custom of the Mandingalbay Yidinji and their regional Aboriginal neighbours with whom they share the same system of customary doctrines and presumptions, land is not only the property of the aboriginal title-holders in the sense of material property, but is also cultural and identity property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The most obvious examples of cultural property are the Story-Places (sometimes called "sacred sites") found on Mandingalbay Yidinji lands, together with their associated oral narratives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">These, along with the paint designs, songs, dances and names associated with them, are the cultural property of the Mandingalbay Yidinji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Most significantly, the land itself in the specific claim area is in Aboriginal doctrine held to be the source of the aboriginal title-holders' membership and group identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">(Rigsby 2002:208) 
 
 The choice of the terms "to own" and "to talk for" the claim area as cultural property arises from the claimant group's own speech usages and the conceptual presumptions behind them, by which "talking for" signifies that the speaker has the authority to make decisions about land use and to release information about cultural matters pertaining to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">This is a core proprietary right of the aboriginal title-holders alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">(Rigsby 2002:209) 
 
 The "cultural estate" pertaining to a specific claim area includes the total body of its claimant group's or groups' knowledge about the land and associated features of its topography, species and other resources, including traditions, customs and practices relating to: 
 
 
 
 i) ancestral sites and tracks; 
 ii) landscape knowledge such as socially relevant topographical divisions, sub-group areas, and sites of relevance to the social history of the aboriginal title-holders such as burial sites and old residential sites; 
 iii) indigenous knowledge of the culinary, medical and "spiritual" properties of plants, animals and other natural resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">(Rigsby 2002:209) 
 
 
 
 Cultural authority and responsibilities may be shared with elders of neighbouring groups as, for example, where a Story Track (the route taken by an Ancestral Being) crosses the territories of a number of groups, in which case knowledge of, and custodial responsibility for, the associated knowledge may be diffused inter-tribally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">There is such a Story Track between Fitzroy Island and Walsh's Pyramid which, some people believe, was formed when Jarruga "Scrub-Hen" travelled from Fitzroy to the Pyramid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Other people believe her direction of movement and her pathway were different again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">(Rigsby 2002:209) 
 
 Rigsby found that senior members of the claimant group had a good knowledge of the old walking tracks and the locations of Story-Places and their site-specific law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">For example, Vincent Mundraby Sr and Alf Mundraby took Rigsby to visit Guliga (which means "wild, angry").</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Guliga is a fresh water lagoon in the Buddabadoo area, which lies outside the claim area but is part of Mandingalbay Yidinji traditional country, where some years ago a spirit Whirlpool surrounded Vincent Sr and frightened him after he broke three traditional laws for the place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">First, he remained in the Guliga and Buluba areas after sundown, whereas traditional law says to stay away from them after dark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Second, he fished there after sundown, whereas traditional law says that people should hunt, fish and gather there in the daytime, not at night.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Third, he took more than he and his family could eat that day; traditional law says that people should take only as much as they need and can use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">(Rigsby 2002:209) 
 
 Over much of classical and contemporary Aboriginal Australia, groups own their own indigenous languages as a result of the actions of the ancestral spirits (Stories or Dreamings or Histories) who placed them in and on the landscape - see Merlan (1981) and Rumsey (1989, 1993, 1994).</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Even when people no longer speak their indigenous languages, they continue to speak of them as their languages and to identify strongly with them (Rigsby 2002:210).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 There have been no fully fluent speakers of the Yidiny / Yidiy language for some years, but people still identify as Yidinji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Many people of all ages know and use the Yidiny / Yidiy words and names for plant and animal species, place names, personal names, etc. and to sing songs in the language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">(Rigsby 2002:210) 
 
 Many place names are also traditional personal names, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">they are handed down the generations in family lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">They also establish special connections between the persons and the countries they name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">We can also regard these traditional names as intellectual property because they are not available for anybody and everybody to bestow and use but only senior traditional owners of the country named can make the decisions and bestow the names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">For example Djullja Mundraby, a young boy, is named for Jalja, a place that lies outside the claim area but within the Mandingalbay Yidinji traditional estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">(Rigsby 2002:210)' 
 

16 Mr Southon concludes:
 
 'Membership of land-owning groups, whether cognatic descent groups or the wider tribal or regional groups, is transmitted from one generation of men and women to the next by patrifiliation based on biological descent in the usual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">People do not acquire property rights and interests in land by inheriting them on the deaths of predecessors, but they gain them automatically, as it were, at birth from their fathers and mothers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The contemporary ethnographic evidence is comprehensive and conclusive on this point, but in classical times by the serial patrifilial principle, people did not gain full or core rights from women, except where there were no other heirs, and occasionally by adoption and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">(Rigsby 2002:210) 
 
 The kinds of ambiguities and/or disputes that can at times arise include the following: 
 
 
 
 i) The distribution of specific family or descent group interests in particular portions of a tribal or regional group estate or territory; 
 ii) The landed status of persons and descent groups of mixed "tribal" or sub-group affiliation, and the status of portions of the land of such mixed or disputed affiliation; 
 iii) The distribution of custodial rights and duties in relation to ancestral and other culturally distinguished sites on the group's estate or territory; 
 iv) Succession to sub-divisions of the groups' estate or territory where the original male clan owners left no children; 
 v) Matters of breach of rights and interests between the aboriginal title-holders and neighbouring groups, or between sub-groups of the aboriginal title-holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">(Rigsby 2002:211) 
 
 
 
 Regarding the reference to neighbouring groups' elders, disputes in relation to an area of land or water or details of the membership of the traditional owner or aboriginal title-holder groups usually involve boundaries, bordering estates or tracts, or persons of mixed affiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Resolution necessarily involves both groups, so the statement of rights and interests needs to make this clear rather than to be read as though it delivers the right to resolve such a matter (or impose a resolution) solely to the claimant aboriginal title group or groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">(Rigsby 2002:211) 
 
 The right to "pass on native title rights and interests in relation to the Determination Area" is one of the native title rights that would be included under this category of "Membership and Dispute Settlement Rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">In 2004 the claimant Alfred Mundraby made the following statement in support of the continuing exercise of the right to pass on native title rights and interests: 
 
 "Old Fred (Alf's father) took me up there when I was about 12, it's a Yidinji way that boys get taken to check country when they are about at puberty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I went then to walk our country with my dad and he pointed out lots of thins to me and told me stories that went with the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">We'd go hunting in the wet when ail the tucker comes down from the ridges, easier to get then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">" 
 
 Another claimant, Fred Mundraby, also offered testimony as to the continuing exercise of the right to pass on native title rights and interests: 
 
 "I went with Alf and Uncle Fred too and I go there with Alf now, like he said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">You know its uncles and fathers that train up our boys, my sons still too young, but soon 1 take them too, bring their uncle Alf too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">" 
 
 On the founding of the mission, its staff and later the staff of the state native affairs department enforced the laws of Queensland and special by-laws which sometime inhibited the full expression of the Gungganyji and Mandingalbay Yidinji peoples' right to possess, occupy, use and enjoy their land and exclude others from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Nevertheless, group heads and leaders, such as Yabalam and Minminiy, explicitly granted rights to live on their lands and to hunt, fish and gather over it to the non-Gungganyji and non-Mandingalbay Yidinji Aboriginal people who were sent to the Yarrabah Mission or who were born there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">As well, people taught the newcomers where the special places were and the law and custom connected with them, so that they could occupy, use and enjoy them too without giving offence to the Stories and the spirits of the Old People.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">(Rigsby 2002:212) 
 
 There was a clear difference between the situation as the missionaries and native affairs staff saw it and the reality of the claimant groups exercising their traditional rights to the land and to naturalise and incorporate others to do so too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">(Rigsby 2002:212)' 
 
 CONTINUING CONNECTION 
 
17 I infer that all respondents have taken such expert advice as they deem appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I note that there are no conflicting native title claims over the subject areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The other claimant group in the immediate vicinity is the Gunggandji people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The history of this application and other applications in the area demonstrates that both peoples have carefully identified the land with which they traditionally relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Clearly, the Gunggandji people and the Mandingalbay Yidinji people were in the area in 1892 when a mission was established in 1892.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Equally clearly, they have maintained their contact with the area ever since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The question is, then, as to the position between the establishment of British sovereignty in 1788 and 1892.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">18 I turn to the history of European contact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Cook visited in June 1770.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">He arrived at Cape Grafton on Saturday 9 June 1770.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">On the previous day, when further to the south, he saw people on small islands off the northern point of Rockingham Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">At about 6.00 am on Saturday 9 June, he identified and named the "Frankland Isles", (now the Frankland Islands) and later, Cape Grafton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Banks recorded the sighting of people on the Frankland Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">That night fires were sighted on the shore of Cape Grafton and during the day, people were seen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">On Sunday 10 June Cook sailed around Cape Grafton and entered what is now Mission Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">He, Banks and Solander went ashore looking for fresh water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">They found streams but access was too difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">They neither encountered people, nor saw signs of habitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">19 On 26 June 1819 Allan Cunningham visited on the ship "Mermaid".</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">He landed on Fitzroy Island and found water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Cunningham noted in his log that:
 
 '(A)n old beaten path from the beach to the back thick brushes, proved to us the Island had been visited (although not recently) by the Aborigines ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Traces of natives were noticed in various parts such as the remains of fires, large holes formed in the search for grubs or larvae of insects and two old huts were discovered on an angle of the shore ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">' 
 

20 He returned in 1821 and noted further evidence of Aboriginal use and occupation, recording that:
 
 '... (B)oth temporary, as well as more ... substantial Huts were seen by us, ... near the beach, the latter being well thatch'd, with the leaves of the Calamus of which likewise some of their water baskets were constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Quantities of burnt shell were strew'd around their fires, the remains of their mussel or cockle feasts, and a canoe form'd from the stem of a Tree 12 feet long, with an outrigger and paddles, was found, hauled up among the mangroves - a fishing, line and hook made by grinding a shell down was taken from a Hut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 

21 A fisherman, Mein, landed at Fitzroy Island in 1857.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">He later moved to Green Island.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">He claimed to have traded with the people of Cape Grafton prior to his departure in 1858.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">22 The above summary is sufficient to identify an apparently permanent occupation of the region by Aboriginal peoples as far back as 1770 and continuing until about 1858.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">There is every reason to assume that occupation continued thereafter and until 1892 when the mission was founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">By that time there were clearly two distinct groups, the Gunggandji people and the Yidinji people, of which latter group the Mandingalbay Yidinji people are part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">There is no reason to conclude that the division was recent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Had it been, one might reasonably have expected the fact to have been reported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">It seems more likely that it was an established fact of life as far as the Aboriginal people were concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">If there were two groups, then they probably identified areas as being the exclusive province of one or other of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This is their own traditional understanding of their history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no reason to doubt it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">23 The Gunggandji people claim the area of a peninsular which is bounded by Mission Bay to the north, the Coral Sea to the north-east, east and south-east, and the Murray Prior Range to the south-west.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">To the west of the Gunggandji claim lies a combined claim by both peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Further to the west lies the land of which the Mandingalbay Yidinji people claim to be traditional owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It stretches from Trinity Bay and Trinity Inlet in the north and north-west to Bell Peak South in the south.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In the north much of the area has been dealt with in ways which have extinguished native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Lot 1 is on Trinity Bay and lots 2, 3 and 4 are on Trinity Inlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Lots 5 and 6 are further to the south.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">They are adjoining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">24 The people encountered by Cook, Banks, Cunningham and Mein were probably Gunggandji coastal dwellers rather than the Yidinji people who lived further inland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">It seems quite unlikely that there would have been substantial cultural, social or technological differences between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The former concentrated on resources available from the ocean, whilst the latter probably resorted to Trinity Bay and Trinity Inlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">If the Gunggandji people had canoes and built huts, it seems likely that the Mandingalbay Yidinji people did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">If the Gunggandji people traded, then presumably, the Mandingalbay Yidinji people did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">25 The claim group is comprised of the descendants of a man called "Jabalum" and others recruited by adoption in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">His name is sometimes spelt in other ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Professor Rigsby suggests that the usual spelling is now "Yabalum".</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">However I understand the preferred spelling to be "Jabalum".</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Professor Rigsby suggests that Jabalum was born about 1853.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Although this estimate is based on rather tenuous evidence, it is probably reasonably accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">His birth therefore pre-dated Mein's arrival in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">According to oral family history, Jabalum was chief of a clan or group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">That clan occupied the larger area of which the determination area is part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">He is mentioned in early mission records as the father of a child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">In 1972 a researcher conducted a lengthy interview with a grandson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There is thus no reason to doubt that Jabalum existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">It seems that his descendants are the only known survivors of that sub-group of the Yidinji people who occupied the determination area prior to 1892.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">26 Early maps prepared by government officials and others, offer general support for the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">They indicate that the Yidinji people or the Yidinji people and the Gunggandji people occupied areas which included the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">They include maps drawn by the then Commissioner of Police, W. E. Parry Okeden (1897), by W. E. Roth (1910, but based on 1898 research concerning language distribution), U. McConnell (1939), D. S. Davidson (1938) and L. Sharp (1939).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">In 1974 Norman B Tindale published his work, 'Aboriginal Tribes of Australia' which has become a standard reference work on the subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">His research also offers some support for the claim, but he appears to have been equivocal concerning the northern areas on Trinity Bay and Trinity Inlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">His field work dated from as early as 1938.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Professor Rigsby's report demonstrates that the Mandingalbay Yidinji culture includes a great wealth of folklore concerning geographical features within, and around, the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">27 In this very brief summary I have not done justice to the detail in Professor Rigsby's report, nor to the helpful summary of it provided by Mr Southon in his affidavits and oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is an available inference that the Mandingalbay Yidinji people have occupied the determination area continuously since prior to 1770.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">That is the only matter about which I have felt concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">I am now satisfied in that regard and that it is appropriate to make the consent determination sought by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">THE DETERMINATION 
 
28 I determine that native title exists in the whole of the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I further determine, pursuant to s 225 of the Act that:
 
 &#8226; the persons holding the communal or group rights comprising the native title are as set out in Schedule 3 to these reasons;
 &#8226; save as to water, the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area are: 
 
 &#8226; in relation to the land and waters in Part A of Schedule 1 to these reasons, the right, in accordance with traditional laws and customs, to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment thereof to the exclusion of all others; and &#8226; in relation to the land and waters in Part B of Schedule 2 to these reasons, the non-exclusive right to the use and enjoyment thereof, including the right to: &#61863; access and be physically thereon in accordance with traditional laws and customs; &#61863; camp thereon in accordance with traditional laws and customs, not including the right to reside permanently or build permanent structures or fixtures; &#61863; hunt, fish and gather thereon for the purpose of satisfying personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs; &#61863; take, use and enjoy the natural resources thereof for the purpose of satisfying personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and non-commercial communal needs in accordance with traditional laws and customs; &#61863; maintain and protect from physical harm, by lawful means, places therein which are of importance to the native title holders in accordance with traditional laws and customs; and &#61863; perform social, cultural, religious, spiritual and ceremonial activities thereon and invite others to participate in those activities in accordance with traditional laws and customs; &#8226; in relation to the land and waters in Part B of Schedule 1 to these reasons, the non-exclusive right to: &#61863; pass on native title in relation thereto in accordance with traditional laws and customs; &#61863; make decisions in accordance with traditional laws and customs concerning access, use and enjoyment thereof by aboriginal people who are governed by the traditional laws acknowledged, and traditional customs observed, by the native title holders; and &#61863; determine membership and filiation to the native title holders in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">&#8226; in relation to all water on, or in, the determination area, the right to: &#61863; use, enjoy, hunt on, fish in and gather from the water for personal domestic, social, cultural, religious, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes, and &#61863; take and use the water and its resources for personal domestic, social, cultural, spiritual, ceremonial and communal purposes, 

provided that:
 
 &#8226; in all such cases, the purpose is non-commercial; and &#8226; such right to water does not confer any right to possession, occupation, use or enjoyment of the water to the exclusion of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">

29 Such native title is subject to, and exercisable in accordance with:
 
&#8226; the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Queensland, including local laws and planning instruments; and
 
&#8226; traditional laws acknowledged, and traditional customs observed by, the native title holders; and 
 
30 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this order there are no native title rights in, or in relation to:
 
 &#8226; minerals as defined in the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld); or &#8226; petroleum as defined in the Petroleum Act 1923 (Qld) and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">

31 Other interests in relation to the determination area are set out in Schedule 4 to these reasons, the relationship between the native title and those other interests being that:
 
 &#8226; such other interests continue to have effect, and the rights conferred thereby or held thereunder, may be exercised notwithstanding the existence of the native title; and &#8226; such other interests and any activity done in exercise of the rights conferred thereby or held thereunder prevail over the native title and any exercise of the native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">

32 The order will contain the following definition clause:
 
 'If a word or expression is not defined in this order, but is defined in the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), then it has the meaning given to it in the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">
 
 In addition to the other words defined in this order: 
 
 
 &#8226; "application" means the Mandingalbay Yidinji native title application QUD 6015 of 1998; 
 &#8226; "Cairns Port Area" means the Port of Cairns as identified in Schedule 1 of the Transport Infrastructure (Ports) Regulation 1994 (Qld); 
 &#8226; "determination area" means the land and waters described in Part A of Schedule 1 and shown on the determination plan and does not include the land and waters as describes in Part B of Schedule 1; 
 &#8226; "determination plan" means the plan contained in Schedule 1; 
 &#8226; "government owned corporation" has the meaning given to it in the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993 (Qld); 
 &#8226; "high water mark" has the meaning given to it in the Land Act 1994 (Qld); 
 &#8226; "laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Queensland" means the common law and the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Queensland, including local laws and planning instruments; 
 &#8226; "local government" has the meaning given to it in the Local Government Act 1993 (Qld); and 
 &#8226; "native title holders" means the persons described in Schedule 3; 
 &#8226; "natural resources" means animal, plant, fish and bird life found on or in the determination area from time to time and clays, sands, shell or soil found on or below the surface of the determination area but does not include minerals or petroleum; and 
 &#8226; "tidal water" has the meaning given to it in the Land Act (1994) (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">' 
 
 

33 I determine that the native title is not to be held in trust and that the Mandingalbay Yidinji Aboriginal Corporation:
 
 &#8226; be the prescribed body corporate for the purposes of s 57(2) of the Act; and
 &#8226; after becoming a registered native title body corporate, perform the functions mentioned s 57(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">

34 This determination is to take effect over lots 5 and 6 in Schedule 1 upon registration on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements of the agreement referred to in paragraph (c) to Schedule 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">35 In the event that the agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of Schedule 4 is not registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements within six months of the date of this order or such later time as the Court may order, the matter is to be listed for further directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">36 Each party to the proceedings is to bear its own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">CONCLUSION 
 
37 These orders are consistent with the terms agreed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">They recognise that the Mandingalbay Yidinji People are the lawful holders of native title in the determination area.</sentence>
