 This is an appeal from an order made in the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the appellants' application pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Part 8 Division 2 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Migration Act ) for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 7 May 2009 and handed down on 8 May 2009: Li Tian &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2009] FMCA 930.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellants are all citizens of the Peoples Republic of China.</sentence>

<sentence id="s5">The appellant has entered Australia on a number of occasions since 17 July 2000, sometimes entering Australia on a Business Long Stay visa and sometimes on a Business Short Stay visa which are two subclasses of a Class UC visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Relevantly, the appellant entered Australia on 2 April 2003 on a Business Long Stay visa on the basis that she would be employed by a standard business sponsor employer, Adcom Strategies Pty Ltd as a sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 10 March 2005 the appellant applied to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (which later became the Department of Immigration and Citizenship) for Employer Nomination (Residence) (Class BW) visas which a delegate decided to refuse on 25 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant sought a review of the delegate's decision in the Tribunal and on 21 June 2007 the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>

<sentence id="s10">The appellants appealed to this Court and, on 29 August 2008, Emmett J set aside the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court and in lieu thereof ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The first respondent was ordered to pay the appellants' costs of the application and the appeal.</sentence>

<sentence id="s16">On 17 February 2005 Revetec Limited lodged an application for approval of a nominated position pursuant to reg 5.19 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (the Regulations).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Regulation 5.19(1) empowers an employer to apply to the Minister for approval of a nominated position as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Regulation 5.19(1B) empowers the Minister to approve or reject an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On 6 July 2005 the Minister approved the application of Revetec Limited as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Revetec Limited nominated the appellant as an employee as sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant applied for an Employer Nomination (Residence) visa --- Subclass 856 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">A person is entitled to a Subclass 856 visa if at the time of the decision that person can satisfy, amongst other criteria, the criteria in regs 856.221 and 856.222 which provide: 
 
 856.221 The appointment mentioned in paragraph 856.213(a) is an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 

 
 
 856.222 The Minister is satisfied that the appointment mentioned in paragraph 856.213(a) will provide the employment referred to in the relevant employer nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 

 The appointment referred to in reg 856.221 is that described in reg 856.213(a) which provides: 
 
 856.213 The applicant: 
 

 
 
 
 
 (a) has been nominated in accordance with subregulation 5.19(2) by an employer in respect of an appointment in the business of that employer; and 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 

 Regulation 856.213 requires an examination of reg 5.19, which relevantly provides: 
 
 5.19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">(1) An employer may apply to the Minister for approval of a nominated position as an approved appointment .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">

<sentence id="s29">Paragraph 4.02(4)(e) provides that a decision under subregulation 5.19(1B) to reject an application is an MRT-reviewable decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">MRT-reviewable decision is defined in Division 2 of Part 5 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 

 
 
 (2) An employer nomination meets the requirements of this subregulation if: 
 

 
 
 (a) the employer nomination is made by an employer in respect of a need for a paid employee in a business: 
 

 
 
 (i) located in Australia; and 
 

 
 
 (ii) operated by that employer; and 
 

 
 
 (b) the work to be performed requires the appointment of a highly skilled person (within the meaning of subregulation (3)); and

 (i) an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident cannot be found who is suitable for the appointment; or 
 

 
 
 (ii) in the circumstances of the case, the employer should not be required to seek a suitable employee in Australia; and 
 

 
 
 (f) the employee is to be employed or engaged in Australia in accordance with the standards for wages and working conditions provided for under relevant Australian legislation and awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 

 The Regulations require an employer who wishes to obtain approval for a nominated position as an approved appointment to apply to the Minister for that approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The nominated position must be paid employment in accordance with the standards for wages and working conditions under relevant awards for a highly skilled person in the employer's Australian business, and be for full time employment for a fixed term of at least three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Minister must be satisfied that there is no Australian citizen or permanent resident who can be found who is suitable for the appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The history of that application has been set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">After the matter was remitted to the Tribunal on 19 November 2008, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant pursuant to s 359A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The appellant's migration agent replied to the Tribunal and enclosed a letter from Revetec Holdings Limited dated 12 December 2008 in which a director wrote: "We advise that our company will continue to support Mrs Tian Li in her application for Subclass 856 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" On 18 December 2008 the Tribunal carried out a search with ASIC to determine the status of Revetec Limited, which was the company which had applied to the Minister for approval of a nominated position which had been approved as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">That search showed that Revetec Limited had on its own application been deregistered by ASIC on 8 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">A search on the same day showed that Revetec Holdings Limited had been incorporated on 4 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">On 18 December 2008 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant's migration advisor inviting comment on information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The information provided was: 
 
 &#9679; On 17 February 2005, Revetec Limited (ACN 079 317 365) (Revetec) applied for approval of a nominated position as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The nominated position was Sales and Marketing Manager and the application was approved on 6 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 

 
 
 &#9679; On 10 March 2005, you applied for a subclass 856 visa on the basis that you were nominated by Revetec in respect of an appointment in the business of Revetec.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The appointment was in the position of Sales and Marketing Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">This application was refused by the delegate on 25 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 

 
 
 &#9679; On 21 June 2007, the Tribunal (differently constituted) affirmed the delegate's decision of 10 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Proceedings brought by you in the Federal Magistrates Court were dismissed on 21 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">However, the Federal Court allowed your appeal on 29 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 

 
 
 &#9679; On 11 March 2007, you applied for a subclass 457 visa (the subclass 457 visa application).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Your proposed business sponsor employer is Billabongs Restaurant Pty Ltd ATF Billabongs Restaurant Unit Trust (Billabongs).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Billabongs was approved as a standard business sponsor on 15 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The nominated activity you were to be employed in was Marketing Specialist (ASCO Code 2221-13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The business nomination application was approved on 15 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

 
 
 &#9679; On 18 December 2008, you provided to the Tribunal a letter from Revetec Holdings Limited (ACN 115 621 317) (Revetec Holdings) stating that this company would continue to support you (sic) subclass 856 application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 

 
 
 &#9679; A search of ASIC's company name search website on 18 December 2008 indicated that Revetec was deregistered on 8 April 2008 (http://www.asic.gov .au/cgi-bin/gns030c?acn=079317365&amp;juris=9&amp;hdtext=ACN&amp;srchsrc=1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 

 
 
 Regulations require that, at the time of the visa application, an applicant has been nominated by an employer, in accordance with subregulation 5.19(2), for an appointment in the business of that employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Regulations require, at time of decision, that the appointment continues to satisfy the criteria for approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The criteria for approval include, amongst other things, that the employer nomination is made by an employer in respect of a need for a paid employee in a business actively and lawfully operating in Australia and operated by that employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 

 
 
 The information is relevant to your review as it indicates that Revetec is no longer actively and lawfully operating a business in Australia and that the appointment with Revetec does not continue to satisfy criteria for approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">If the Tribunal makes these findings it may also find that you do not meet relevant criteria, particularly clause 856.221.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 

 On 30 January 2009 Revetec Holdings Limited wrote to the Tribunal: 
 
 We refer to your invitation to comment on the 18 th December 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 

 
 
 We thank you for granting the extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 

 
 
 Revetec Holdings was incorporated to meet the public listing requirements of the Newcastle Stock Exchange and Australian Security &amp; Investments Commission Requirements in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 

 
 
 The reason was that in April 1996, Bradley Howell-Smith incorporated Revolution Engine Technologies Pty Ltd for the purpose of building the initial CCE prototype.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Revetec Limited was established in August 1997 for the purpose of acquiring 100 per cent of the issued shares in Revolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Revetec Holdings Limited was incorporated on 4 August 2005 to acquire the business assets of Revetec Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 

 
 
 Revetec is essentially the successor of Revetec Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">As a result it has a new ABN and ACN number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Revetec Holdings Ltd therefore continues the support of Miss Tian Li's subclass 856 visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The sponsorship undertakings remain the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 

 On 26 February 2009 the appellant and her migration advisor attended a hearing of the Tribunal and produced a letter from Revetec Holdings Limited dated 18 February 2009 in which it was stated: 
 
 We confirm that in 2005 Revetec Limited was desirous of issuing a Prospectus for listing with the NSX Stock Exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 

 
 
 Revetec's consultant advised the company that it would be necessary to from (sic) a new entity to acquire the goodwill, assets and liabilities and the employees of Revetec.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Consequently, Revetec Holdings Limited was incorporated and a sales contract was signed between Revetec Limited and Revetec Holdings Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

 
 
 The shares in Revetec Limited were essentially rolled over to the new company, whereby the shareholders in the new company comprise of the previous shareholders including the new shareholders who subscribed under the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

 
 
 Tian Li sponsorship by Revetec was effectively assigned over to Revetec Holdings Limited as were all employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 

 
 
 Essentially Revetec Holdings is the successor of Revetec Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 

 On 12 March 2009 the Tribunal was provided with a document signed by counsel which was entitled an "MRT Submission" but took the form of an opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Counsel expressed the opinion that "there is no obstacle to RH [Revetec Holdings Limited], as the legal successor to RL [Revetec Limited], being treated as the employer for the purposes of the present application" (underlined in the original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Counsel expressed the further opinion that if the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review "there is a solid foundation for the existence of jurisdictional error if proceedings were taken in the Federal Magistrates Court to challenge the adverse decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">On 7 May 2009 the Tribunal handed down its decision in which it referred to the matters to which I have referred and the opinion with which it was provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">After discussing those matters, the Tribunal concluded: Revetec was the employer who nominated the applicant in respect of an appointment in the business of Revetec.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">However, at the time of decision, the applicant cannot be employed in the business of Revetec as Revetec no longer exists as it was deregistered by ASIC on 8 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Therefore, the applicant cannot be employed by Revetec in relation to an approved appointment and the Tribunal finds accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">For all of the above reasons and on the above findings the Tribunal also finds that the applicant does not satisfy the criterion in clause 856.221.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Federal Magistrate upheld the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">She said: Regulation 5.19(2) makes clear that the criteria that the specific employer must satisfy includes that the specific employer has made and continues to make adequate provision for training existing employees (or for future training of employees if the business is newly established); and, that the Minister is satisfied that a suitable Australian citizen or permanent resident cannot be found, in which case, the specific employer should not be required to seek a suitable employee in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Regulation 5.19(2)(f) (sic) provides that an employee employed in such circumstances must be engaged in accordance with the standards for wages and working conditions provided under relevant Australian legislation and awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In accordance with 856.22 (sic), the criteria in 856.221 to be satisfied at the time of decision makes clear, that it is the appointment referred to in cl.856.213(a) that is the "approved appointment" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Clause 856.222 refers to "the employer referred to in the relevant employer nomination" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">To my mind, those words make clear that the reference is specific to the employer in respect of whom approval to nominate was granted, namely Revetec Limited and not Revetec Holdings Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">She concluded: In the circumstances, the Tribunal's finding that, at the time of its decision, the Applicant was not employed in the business of Revetec Limited was correct as Revetec Limited no longer existed, having been deregistered by ASIC on 8 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Tribunal's findings that the Applicant was therefore not employed by Revetec Limited in relation to an approved appointment at the time of its decision was open to it on the evidence and material before it and for the reasons it gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal applied the correct law to its findings in considering whether or not the Applicant satisfied the statutory criteria for a subclass 856 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Tribunal's finding that the Applicant, therefore, does not satisfy the criterion in cl.856.221 is without error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">There is an error in paragraph 29 of the Federal Magistrate's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Regulation 856.222 is not in the form her Honour has quoted in that paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The regulation reads: "... employment referred in the relevant employer nomination".</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Minister contended that as her Honour had previously set out the regulation correctly (at [16]), the misquotation is merely a typographical error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I do not think that is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">I think the sentence which follows the misquotation suggests that her Honour wrongly read the regulation as it is quoted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Earlier in her reasons, the Federal Magistrate wrongly referred to and set out the current form of reg 5.19 rather than the correct and relevant form: [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The Minister contended that her Honour did have regard to the relevant form of the regulation in [28] of her reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">I think that is right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I think her reasons at [28] address the regulation as it then stood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There are three grounds of appeal, but only one was pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Her Honour erred in finding that the First Appellant could not satisfy the requirements of cl 856.221 and 856.222 of the Migration Regulations 1994 solely for the reason that the company which had originally applied for approval of her appointment under reg 5.19 was no longer in existence having transferred the entirety of its business to another company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The appellant contended that she satisfied the criteria because she would be employed by Revetec Holdings Limited which had acquired the business of Revetec Limited and she would therefore be employed in the same business for which approval was given under reg 5.19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Regulation 856.222 requires the Minister to be satisfied that the appointment in paragraph 856.213 (a) will provide the employment referred to in the relevant employer nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The employment referred to in the relevant employer nomination was with Revetec Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The appellant's contention that she will be employed in the same business which had been approved by the Minister and therefore satisfies reg 856.222 cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Regulation 5.19 provides for a procedure to approve a nominated position as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The only person who can apply for that approval is the employer and the application is for a position with that employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The criteria that must be satisfied by the employer include criteria that are personal to the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The employer must be able to satisfy the Minister that the position requires an employee who is highly skilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Minister must be satisfied that no Australian citizen or permanent resident can be found to fill the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The employer must satisfy the Minister that adequate provision is made for training existing employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In my opinion, reg 5.19 contemplates a process whereby the Minister in exercising the power in reg 5.19 approves a nominated position for the employer who makes the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The approved appointment is not at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It is for a nominated position with the employer who made the application under the regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">As soon as Revetec Limited either ceased to carry on its business or ceased to exist it was not capable of providing any appointment to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Minister in those circumstances could not have been satisfied that Revetec Limited, which had secured the appointment, could provide the employment referred to in the relevant employer nomination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The appellant could not satisfy the criteria in reg 856.222.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The relevant employer nomination was made by Revetec Limited and the position for which it sought approval was with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The appellant could only rely upon Revetec Holdings Limited in support of her application for a Subclass 856 visa if Revetec Holdings Limited had first been approved as an approved appointment under reg 5.19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">If the appellant's construction were right, it would render the process in reg 5.19 pointless if the person seeking the visa intended to work for some other employer other than the employer who was seeking approval of a nominated position as an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In my opinion, the Federal Magistrate was right to conclude as she did, that the decision of the Tribunal was not infected with error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The first and fourth appellants must pay the first respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
