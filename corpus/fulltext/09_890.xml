 INTRODUCTION 
 This case is about a comparison report concerning acoustic shock protection devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">These devices are amplifiers that are commonly used to limit the levels of sounds heard by call centre workers and to reduce the risk of acoustic shock which the workers sometimes experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The devices that were compared used digital sign processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Earlier versions were analogue devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Since 2001 the applicant (Polaris) has sold a limiting amplifier called SoundShield, which is designed, through the use of internal settable controls, to be inter-operable with a wide range of host telephones and any headset type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Since about September 2006 the second respondent (Plantronics) has sold a competing limiting amplifier called M15D, which is designed solely for use with Plantronics equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">M15D was developed as the result of collaboration between Plantronics and the first respondent (Dynamic) which commenced in early 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The aim of the collaboration, called the Tecate project, was to produce a limiting amplifier to compete with SoundShield, in particular in relation to Telstra, a major customer for such devices, which had its own particular requirements with respect to limiting amplifiers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">These requirements were contained in Telstra's specification TP TT404B51 called "Specification --- Headset &amp; Limiting Amplifier, Acoustic Protection" (TT4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Polaris was at the time a supplier of devices to Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In mid-2005 Dynamic distributed a report entitled "Comparisons of Acoustic Protection Devices --- Plantronics ADRO&reg; M15D versus the Polaris SoundShield&reg;".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The report was provided to Telstra, which gave a copy to Polaris on a confidential basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Plantronics provided a copy to Siemens, which was then its exclusive distributor in Australia of acoustic shock protection devices and telephone headsets, for the purpose of distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Plantronics also gave a copy to Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The report was distributed in long and short form, though only the short form is at issue in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The report was produced at a time when Telstra was in the process of preparing a request for tender for the ongoing supply to it of acoustic shock protection devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Plantronics and Polaris proposed to put in tenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Telstra tender was worth a considerable amount to the successful tenderer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The quantum is confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">At the time of the report SoundShield was the dominant product in the market, having achieved a very large number of sales, a substantial proportion having been made to Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The number and proportion are confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">COMPARISON REPORT 
 The report is four pages in length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Apart from the title, the first page contains only Dynamic's name and logo, the names of the authors, Christi Wise, Bonar Dickson, Hayley Fiket and Peter Blamey, and a footnote by which Dynamic claims copyright in the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The authors were all Dynamic employees when the report was prepared and distributed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Ms Wise conducted the testing the subject of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On page 2 of the report, under the heading "Background", appears the following: 
 
 Superior sound processing is especially important in call centres where essential information is being conveyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The open plan office layout typical of a call centre exposes phone operators to distracting background noises such as ringing phones, voices of fellow operators, and noise produced by office equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 

 
 
 When background noise contains speech or speech-like content, its distracting effect on intelligibility is greater than from other types of noise of equivalent intensity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 

 After noting the negative effect of background noise --- loss of efficiency in working memory capacity, slower reaction times, reduced accuracy and greater degree of perceived effort, the report continues: 
 
 A distorted speech signal will exacerbate the problems associated with speech perception in noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">When the level or quality of the line signal is poor and the ambient noise level is high, speech can be hard to understand, even when the overall level of the speech is increased using the volume control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">At high intensity levels, speech can sound distorted and become difficult to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This can cause fatigue and stress for the listener when straining to understand over long periods of time in these environments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 

 The next heading is "ADRO&reg;".</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It will be recalled that the title of the report includes the words "Plantronics ADRO&reg; M15D".</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Plantronics device was referred to by the parties and by witnesses as both ADRO and M15D interchangeably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I will refer to it as M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Under the ADRO heading the report states: 
 
 The ADRO&reg; processing scheme developed by Dynamic Hearing Pty Ltd is designed to deal with these difficult listening situations without degrading or distorting the sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">ADRO&reg; was developed to meet specifications for acoustic shock protection whilst also providing superior sound quality and intelligibility in comparison to existing products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It uses a set of fuzzy logic rules to adjust gain so that the output signal is always within the comfortable and audible range of the listener.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The system produces a high level of speech understanding, while also maintaining a comfortable loudness level and a high sound quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 

 The report then describes the test that was carried out: 
 
 To demonstrate its superior abilities, ADRO&reg; was compared with SOUNDSHIELD&reg; in a simulated call centre environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The SOUNDSHIELD&reg; is a handset amplifier commonly used in Australian call centres to provide protection from acoustic shock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Plantronics Supra Monaural H51-TT3 headset was used with both ADRO&reg; and SOUNDSHIELD&reg;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Both headset amplifiers were adjusted to the lowest limiting setting and the maximum volume setting, as is typically done by phone operators to provide maximum intelligibility in quiet and in noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The receive signal level was the same for both devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 

 Under the heading "ADRO&reg; improves the intelligibility of speech", the report states: 
 
 The Phonetically Balanced Monosyllable (PBM) word test was presented in typical call centre background noise levels (55-66dBA) to eight adults with normal hearing who were asked to repeat all the words that they heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 

 
 
 In low level ambient noise (55dBA), the error rate for SOUNDSHIELD&reg; (18%) was double that of ADRO&reg; (9%).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In moderate level background noise (65dBA), the error rate for SOUNDSHIELD&reg; increased to 26%, whilst the error rate for ADRO&reg; only increased to 12%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 

 
 
 Extrapolation of the PBM results for different background noise levels are shown in Figure 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">To achieve an intelligibility score of 90% with the SOUNDSHIELD&reg;, the background noise level of the call centres would have to be reduced to an unrealistic level of about 40dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">ADRO&reg; on the other hand, easily achieved 90% intelligibility with call centre background noise at a level of 55dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 

 
Page 3 of the report contains Figure 1 referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The graph is described as "Percentage Correct on PBM Word Lists as a Function of Background Noise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The expression "dBA" in the Figure and in the report is a specific variety of decibel (dB), described in the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) Guidelines referred to at [14] as "Logarithmic measurement of sound pressure level measured through an 'A' curve filter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">A more readily understood description is that "dBA" is used for measuring sound in the environment, often called "in free field".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Under the heading "ADRO&reg; was preferred by listeners" the report states: 
 
 Without knowing which headset amplifier they were listening to, the eight normally hearing adults were asked to rate their impressions of loudness, sound quality, and overall impression for two levels of background noise (55 and 65dBA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Figure 2 illustrates that 95 to 100% of the responses were in favour of ADRO&reg; in background noise at a level of 65dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 

 
Then appears Figure 2 which is described as "Preferences in 65dBA of noise in percentage of times chosen for perception of loudness, quality preference, and overall preference".</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The report continues:
 
 
 These results are highly statistically significant indicating that the sound quality differences were obvious to the listener.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 

 The material under the next heading, "ADRO&reg; will increase the efficiency of phone operators", is: 
 
 This data demonstrates that the use of ADRO&reg; in call centre environments allows for typical call centre background noise levels whilst maintaining good speech intelligibility and superior sound quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Being able to hear well under such challenging conditions, will result in: 
 

 reduced stress, fatigue and anxiety of phone operators fewer mistakes by phone operators reduced call costs due to less repetition better customer service leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction
 
 
 ADRO&reg; is G616 compliant and suitable for TT4 compliant operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 

 
TT4 is referred to at [3] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">G616 is ACIF Guideline "Acoustic safety for telephone equipment": ACIF G616: 2004 (G616).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">G616 is an industry wide document, whereas TT4 is Telstra specific.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Under the heading "Acknowledgments" the report states: 
 
 The research that resulted in this report was conducted at Dynamic Hearing, Richmond, Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The work was covered by ethics approval from the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee (Project 03 529H).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 

 Page 4 of the report contains a list of reference works linked by number to various parts of the report set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Underneath the references are statements that ADRO&reg; is a registered trade mark of Dynamic and SOUNDSHIELD&reg; is a registered trade mark of Polaris Acoustics Pty Ltd. At the foot of the page is the copyright note that also appears at the bottom of page 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">THE PLEADINGS 
 The amended statement of claim identifies four representations or sets of representations alleged to have been made by Dynamic in the comparison report: the lowest limiting setting representation the ethics approval representation the unsuitability representations the test set up representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
Only the first two were pleaded in the original statement of claim (June 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The others were added in May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Lowest limiting setting representation
 This is that the testing of SoundShield and M15D at their lowest limiting settings provided an appropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Dynamic and Plantronics admit making the representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Polaris alleges that the lowest limiting setting representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because the lowest limiting setting at which SoundShield was tested was significantly lower than that for M15D, and the test results consequently conveyed a misleading assessment of the comparative performance capabilities of SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This allegation is denied by Dynamic and Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Ethics approval representation
 This is the statement at [15] that the research that resulted in the comparison report was covered by ethics approval from the Human Research and Ethics Committee (the Ethics Committee).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Dynamic and Plantronics admit that the ethics approval representation was made, but deny that it was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Unsuitability representations
 The background to the unsuitability representations is pleaded as follows: 
(a) at all material times there were two guidelines for acoustic shock protection devices in Australia, namely G616 and TT4;
 
(b) in December 2005 Telstra released a request for tender for the supply to it of acoustic shock protection devices and telephone headsets (Telstra's RFT);
 
(c) Telstra's RFT included a requirement, as specified in TT4, that any acoustic shock protection device supplied to Telstra must have 90% intelligibility in call centre environments with conversation chatter to 55dBA (the Telstra intelligibility requirement);
 
(d) at least since July 2005 Dynamic and Plantronics were aware of the Telstra intelligibility requirement and that Telstra was intending to release Telstra's RFT; and
 
(e) the comparison report was prepared by Dynamic and amended at the suggestion of Plantronics for the purpose of providing it to Telstra in response to Telstra's RFT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">As to [21(a)] Dynamic and Plantronics admit the existence of G616 and TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Plantronics admits the allegation in [21(d)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Otherwise they both deny or substantially deny the allegations in [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Polaris then identifies the three unsuitability representations: 
(a) SoundShield is unsuitable for use in call centres because of its poor intelligibility where background noise is present;
 
(b) SoundShield does not comply with the Telstra intelligibility requirement; and
 
(c) SoundShield is not suitable for TT4 compliant operation and is not G616 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">These, it is said, are to be implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In its particulars Polaris says why the implication is to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I will return to the particulars at [201].</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Dynamic and Plantronics either deny or substantially deny the above allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Polaris alleges that the unsuitability representations were misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because SoundShield did have the attributes the representations claimed it did not have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Dynamic and Plantronics deny these allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Test set up representations
 Polaris alleges that the comparison report represents that: 
(a) the test on which it was based was a properly conducted scientific test designed and undertaken with an appropriate level of skill, independence and expertise for the purpose of a proper comparison of the two devices tested;
 
(b) the test conditions were not biased to favour one device over the other, but instead were an accurate reflection of the conditions normally experienced in call centres;
 
(c) both devices were appropriately set up for the test conditions; and
 
(d) the results of the test were an accurate reflection of the relative performance of the two devices in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">These representations, it is said, are to be implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In its particulars Polaris says why that is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Dynamic admits the making of the representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Plantronics does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Polaris alleges that the test set up representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because the test did not have the characteristics represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In extensive particulars which are considered at [135] to [200], Polaris sets out the bases for the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Dynamic and Plantronics deny the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Balance of the pleading
 Polaris contends that: 
(a) Plantronics caused the comparison report to be published and distributed, and thereby adopted and disseminated the statements and representations pleaded;
 
(b) by causing the publication and distribution of the report Dynamic and Plantronics engaged in conduct in the course of trade and commerce;
 
(c) by making the various representations Dynamic and Plantronics engaged in conduct that was misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Act);
 
(d) in the alternative to (c), Dynamic and Plantronics falsely represented in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods that the M15D and SoundShield devices were each of a particular standard, quality or grade;
 
(e) the events that constituted a contravention of s 52 also resulted in a contravention of s 53(a) of the Act; and 
 
(f) it has suffered loss and damage by reason of the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The hearing the subject of these reasons was concerned only with whether there had been contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Plantronics admits that it provided a copy of the report to Westpac and Siemens, but otherwise denies [27(a)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It admits that its provision of these copies was conduct in trade and commerce, but otherwise denies [27(b)].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It denies the other allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Dynamic does not plead to [27(a)] and denies the other allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING 
 In Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 223 ; (2002) 193 ALR 629 the Full Court made some helpful observations about comparative advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Gillette and Energizer manufactured and distributed batteries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Gillette used the brand name "Duracell", and supplied alkaline batteries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Energizer used the brands "Energizer" and "Eveready".</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It supplied both alkaline and carbon zinc batteries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Alkaline batteries last longer but are more expensive than carbon batteries of the same size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Energizer sought to restrain Gillette's television advertisement which claimed that the Eveready Super Heavy Duty Battery (a carbon zinc battery) "just can't keep up", and that "with up to three times more power Duracell will always win", on grounds that included that the advertisement did not reveal that there was a substantial price differential between the two batteries, and thus consumers could be misled in comparing the value of the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">On that basis the trial judge granted an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Full Court allowed Gillette's appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Heerey J said at [20]: 
 
 The characterisation of advertising as comparative does not of itself have legal significance, or create any kind of presumption in favour of a party alleging a breach of Pt V of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">There is no basis in the TPA for regarding comparative advertising as an inherently disreputable form of commercial conduct, to be viewed with suspicion by the courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">On the contrary, to the extent that comparative advertising provides consumers with accurate hard facts about competing products, it assists in the making of better informed consumer choices and thereby results in more effective competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Of course, the more actual comparisons that are used, the more potential there is for error (and half-truth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">So advertisers have to be careful ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Assertions of factual inaccuracy have to be carefully considered by courts in comparative advertising cases, no differently from any other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

 Heerey J then rejected Energizer's contention that to compare the products without mentioning the price was not to make a full comparison and was thus unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">His Honour said at [22]: 
 
 [The] textual basis [for the contention] is the heading of Div 1 of Pt V , "Unfair practices".</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">But to use general notions of unfairness, which bring to mind the concept of unconscionable conduct appearing elsewhere in the TPA, is to put an unwarranted gloss on the plain words of provisions of Pt V such as ss 52(1) and 53 (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Provided the factual assertions are not untrue, or misleading half-truths, an advertiser can lawfully compare a particular aspect of its product or service favourably with the same aspect of a competitor's product or service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">
 

 His Honour then considered an example that had been discussed in argument where airline X advertised that its economy class seats provide 20 cm more leg room than those of airline Y.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">If that claim is true, s 52 does not oblige airline X to provide in its advertisement detailed information as to the other factors which might influence consumers choosing between airlines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">And if airline Y wanted to advertise that its fares were cheaper, its aircraft more modern, and its flights more frequent, that would be legitimate so long as "no untruths or misleading half-truths are stated": at [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Returning to the facts before him, Heerey J concluded at [24]: 
 
 A consumer, informed by the advertisement (correctly, it must be assumed for present purposes) that the Duracell battery lasts three times longer than the Eveready Super Heavy Duty battery, can make his or her decision at the point of sale whether the extra power of the Duracell is worth the higher price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">I do not see how it could be said that such a consumer has been misled or deceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Indeed, it would be inconsistent with the policy and objectives of the TPA to restrict a trader from publicising, truthfully, a feature of its product which is superior to the same feature of a competitor's product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 

 
His Honour went on to explain why that was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The other members of the Full Court were of the same opinion: Lindgren J at [53] (pages 646-647 point (7)) and Merkel J at [85], [91] and [93].</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">THE WITNESSES 
 Polaris
 Trevor Guest established Polaris in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It first manufactured SoundShield in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Mr Guest has over 25 years experience in the sale of telecommunications equipment in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He has no formal technical or scientific qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">However his experience in the manufacture, importation and sale of this equipment has exposed him to a wide variety of technical matters associated with sound regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He said he is familiar with the various technical standards that apply to telecommunication devices in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He has personally installed SoundShields and other telecommunications equipment in a range of customer premises, has programmed SoundShield on numerous occasions and is familiar with the device and the settings contained within it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Mr Guest swore four affidavits and wascross-examined at length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">He came across as an honest witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">On one occasion, when he was describing a test he had done of SoundShield, he seemed to gild the lily by describing it as a comparative test of SoundShield and M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">However, I think this was attributable to confusion on his part and was not an attempt to mislead the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">He conceded that he was wrong to characterise his test as a comparative one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Guest accepted that his lack of formal technical qualifications meant he could not express authoritative opinions about scientific, electronic and audiological matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">However, his long involvement in the acoustic protection device industry, his participation in the formulation of industry standards, and his hands on experience, provided sufficient basis for the evidence he gave as to the industry, the general effect of the standards and the mechanisms of SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">I have emphasised the word "general" because Mr Guest was not seised of the detail of the standards or of the technical attributes of the various devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The best example of this was his confusion about the headset profiles, when he was at odds with his own experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">In addition, Professor Blamey took exception to many of Mr Guest's measurements, in particular his unexplained transition between the different types of decibels --- dB, dBA, dB SPL at DRP --- as though they were all the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Thus, on matters of a technical nature, I do not regard him as having the expertise to express opinions that can compete with those of acknowledged experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Ben Minski joined Polaris in 2004 as an account manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">More recently he has been the project/implementation manager of the major roll outs of SoundShields into call centres nationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">His experience includes installing over 20,000 SoundShields in approximately 80 call centres Australia wide, and he was consequently familiar with the device, the different technical settings contained within it, which settings best suit particular technical environments and users, and what happens if a device is not correctly customised to its particular environment and user.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">His evidence was largely uncontroversial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">He was cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I thought him an honest witness, a conclusion that was confirmed by the fact that on one topic his evidence did not assist Polaris' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Rodney Thompson was in charge of the technical side of Polaris' business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">He has tertiary electronic engineering qualifications, and experience as an engineer with Telstra and since 2006 with Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He is familiar with the measurement of sound signals and signal levels generally, the various telecommunications standards in use in Australia, and what those standards mean in technical terms for the Australian telephone network and devices that operate in conjunction with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">He was cross-examined, and the concessions he made in the course of his evidence made it clear that he was giving a truthful account of matters on which he spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Philip Newell is an Emeritus Professor at the Speech, Hearing and Language Research Centre, which is part of the Linguistics Department at Macquarie University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">He is a qualified audiologist with postgraduate degrees in biomechanics and audiology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">As a result of his qualifications and experience over nearly 30 years, he has a detailed understanding of the different factors that affect speech, sound and signal quality generally, including the way devices such as hearing aids, amplifiers and telephone equipment operate to modify sounds and signals, and the effects of those modifications on human hearing and speech intelligibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Professor Newell's expertise was not challenged by the respondents, though they claimed he was not truly independent of Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I preface my discussion of this issue by saying that this was the first time Professor Newell had given expert evidence, and I sensed that he found it somewhat of an ordeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In his first affidavit he disclosed his several letters of instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In the letter dated 11 September 2007 Professor Newell was told that Michael Fisher of National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) had undertaken a further intelligibility study and that the Professor had "kindly agreed to verify and confirm these results".</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">These were the results of a test Mr Fisher carried out in July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Professor Newell had earlier been provided with a report detailing the results of tests Mr Fisher made in January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The letter went on to say that arrangements had been made for Professor Newell to attend NAL's premises and undertake the following: Supervise the repetition of the intelligibility test undertaken by Mr Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Verify the testing protocols used are in accord with Telstra TT4 Specifications and associated documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Confirm the results of the tests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Provide a report of your findings ...
 This was a most incautious letter of instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Polaris' solicitors were obviously happy with Mr Fisher's July 2007 test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">But because of his closeness to SoundShield --- he was its inventor --- I infer that they thought the results needed some independent imprimatur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Professor Newell was to "verify and confirm" Mr Fisher's results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Of course Professor Newell cannot be blamed for his letter of instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In cross examination he was challenged about his independence, and I accept his response that, notwithstanding the unfortunate verbiage of his instructions, he did not see his task to be simply to endorse or confirm Mr Fisher's results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He said that if the results of his test differed from those earlier obtained by Mr Fisher, he would say so in his report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">However, my acceptance that Professor Newell would report his results as they were, even though they may not have corresponded with Mr Fisher's, is not the end of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The respondents also submit that Mr Fisher had such an input into the setting up of the test that Professor Newell was not truly independent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Professor Newell's description of his commission confirms Mr Fisher's close involvement in what the Professor subsequently did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He agreed that: the test was set up mostly by Mr Fisher, though he did have some input the word list used in the test was suggested by Mr Fisher, and the Professor agreed with the suggestion Mr Fisher made a large number of suggestions, but the Professor was generally very happy with them Mr Fisher had significant input into the design of the experiment and the setting up of the equipment Mr Fisher suggested the input voltage the Professor should use in the tests, namely in the order of 40 to 60mV he relied completely on what Mr Fisher told him about the various inputs to SoundShield he took "on trust" what Mr Fisher told him was the appropriate input voltage level and the appropriate setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
Professor Newell also agreed that he accepted Mr Fisher's assurance that provided SoundShield was set to HIGH, it would perform correctly with 100mV input, though he had not done any measurement himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Professor Newell did not attempt to hide Mr Fisher's involvement in the setting up of the tests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He stressed, however, that he only implemented Mr Fisher's suggestions because he agreed with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He said he was given the opportunity to disagree with Mr Fisher's suggestions or modify them if he wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">He also said that although when he went to the laboratory the test was all set up, he had to spend quite some time with Mr Fisher looking in great detail at how the equipment was attached together and what the control settings were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">It "was almost as if I had set it all up myself".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I have concluded that Mr Fisher's involvement does not establish that Professor Newell's test was not independent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">However, I bear in mind in assessing the weight to be accorded to the results that Mr Fisher had an important input into the construction of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The respondents also relied on the fact that Professor Newell was one of the supervisors of Mr Fisher's ongoing research for a PhD to show his closeness to Mr Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In an affidavit the Professor said the research was "not related to the subject matter of this proceeding".</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">An extract from the university website's description of Mr Fisher's research topic was put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It included this passage: 
 
 Headset users within call centres face numerous problems related to their headset usage, such as: limited telephone speech intelligibility amidst background noise of the call centre, acoustic discomfort, acoustic shock injury, acoustic isolation from colleagues and vocal strain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Many of these problems are interdependent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The aim of this research is to investigate aspects of these problems and to develop methods for improving the outcomes of headset use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 

 Professor Newell's response was unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">His statement that Mr Fisher's PhD was "not related to the subject matter of this proceeding" became "there are many areas of the PhD which have relevance to the court proceedings, and that is what I meant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">However this issue has not led me to think that the Professor's involvement in Mr Fisher's research project, with its partial overlap with some of the issues in the case, would lead him to carry out his tests with any partiality or to give evidence that was not impartial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Michael Fisher is a senior research engineer employed by Australian Hearing at NAL.</sentence>

<sentence id="s199">In his thirteen years with NAL he has undertaken research in audio signal processing, acoustics, digital signal processing, hearing, hearing impairment, psychoacoustics and speech analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Mr Fisher is listed as the inventor on Australian Standard Patent 2002318963 entitled "Digital Signal processing system and method for telephony interface apparatus" that covers various algorithms, including a method of reducing the amplitude of "shrieks" (the shriek rejection algorithm) that are the major source of acoustic shock injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The patentee is HearWorks Pty Ltd and Polaris is now the licensee from HearWorks of software designed to instruct a digital signal processing device to perform the shriek rejection algorithm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Mr Fisher receives from HearWorks a small distribution of the royalties paid to it by Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He has assisted Polaris with implementing the software in the SoundShield device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">I do not doubt Mr Fisher's expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He was the inventor of SoundShield, and admitted that he was affronted by the results of the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He was, I think, anxious to prove it wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In that behalf he carried out two tests of his own, and helped set up Professor Newell's test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">His affront manifested itself in expostulations, noisy exhalations and gestures of bewilderment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">When he sensed that Table 5.9 of TT4 (see [145] below) was being used to suggest that SoundShield may not be TT4 compliant, he described the table as "absolutely crazy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">I do not think that the fact that he was offended by the comparison report affected the quality of his evidence on the technical matters with which it dealt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He was subjected to very lengthy trenchant cross-examination, and this, coupled with the fact that he was obviously suffering from a cold, may have contributed to his expostulations etc. Plantronics

<sentence id="s216">His expertise was not in doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">He gave his evidence concisely and authoritatively.</sentence>

<sentence id="s222">He has over 25 years experience in the telecommunications industry, in technical, sales and management roles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Mr Gherbaz's evidence was largely about the development of M15D, collaboration between Plantronics and Dynamic and the development of the comparison report and its distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It was largely uncontroversial.</sentence>

<sentence id="s233">Professor Blamey was cross-examined at length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">He displayed an impressive grasp of the topics upon which he gave evidence, and handled with ease the volume of documentary material he was asked to consider and review in the witnesses box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">He retained his composure through some gruelling technical cross examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">He refused to be hurried in his responses, and when necessary called for a document in order to be sure he understood what was being asked of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">He asked that corrections be made to parts of his affidavit which he had discovered since swearing it to be wrong.</sentence>

<sentence id="s249">I have no reason to doubt the truth of his evidence, and I accept the central point of it, namely that the graph he prepared in December 2005 containing output levels of two settings of the M15D, two settings of SoundShield and one setting of another device shows the same output levels that would have applied in May 2005 when the comparison was carried out by Dynamic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">READERS OF THE COMPARISON REPORT 
 Whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive is a question of fact to be determined having regard to the entire context of the conduct including the background of all surrounding circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">One of those circumstances, in a case such as the present, is the class of persons to whom the conduct was directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">In Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at [103] the whole Court said: 
 
 Where [the class of consumers] are not identified individuals to whom a particular misrepresentation has been made ... but are members of a class to which the conduct in question was directed in a general sense, it is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of that class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The inquiry thus is to be made with respect to this hypothetical individual why the misconception complained of has arisen or is likely to arise if no injunctive relief be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">
 

 Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ returned to the question in Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 ( Butcher ) at [36]-[37]: 
 
 The relevant class addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Questions of allegedly misleading conduct, including questions as to what the conduct was, can be analysed from two points of view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">One is employed in relation to "members of a class to which the conduct in question [is] directed in a general sense".</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The other, urged by the purchasers here, is employed where the objects of the conduct are "identified individuals to whom a particular misrepresentation has been made ..."; they are considered quite apart from any class into which they fall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Adoption of the former point of view requires isolation by some criterion or criteria of a representative member of the class ... 
 

 
 
 The former approach is common when remedies other than those conferred by s 82 (or s 87) of the Act are under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">But the former approach is inappropriate, and the latter is inevitable, in cases like the present, where monetary relief is sought by a plaintiff who alleges that a particular representation was made to identifiable persons, of whom the plaintiff was one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">
 

 The present case requires what in Butcher their Honours called the former approach --- looking at the impugned conduct through the eyes of members of the class to which it was directed in a general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Polaris is not complaining that it was misled by the representations in the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">It is worried that whoever might have received the report could be misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Thus it is necessary to identify the class of persons who, having received the report, are likely to be influenced by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The market for noise suppression devices of the kind referred to in the report consists of businesses which conduct call centres in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Telstra is one such business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Mr Gherbaz, Plantronics' managing director, said the M15D was being developed for both the forthcoming Telstra RFT and for the general market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The comparison report was intended to be used and was used for the general market as well as to assist Plantronics in relation to the tender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">He said the potential readers of the report would be Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) managers in organisations and call centre managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">They were the officers with whom Plantronics would deal in connection with enquiries about its devices and sales of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Thus it was the OH&amp;S manager of Westpac who enquired of Mr Gherbaz about its products and what path to go down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">He sent her a copy of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The report was not made available to the general public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">It was common ground that call centres have staff with technical skills and qualifications who can deal with headset or computer problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Often call centres will have access to audiologists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">According to Mr Gherbaz, when a call centre encounters an acoustic shock protection problem, or seeks information about protection devices, its information technology telephony people will contact suppliers such as Plantronics or Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Accordingly, those who read the comparison report would have an understanding of call centre operations and the difficulties encountered by telephone operators, such as those summarised in the "Background" part of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Because readers will be of a managerial class accustomed to dealing with noise and other problems encountered by their operators, they are likely to have some understanding of the technical issues with which the report deals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">They are likely also to have access to experts, including audiologists, to discuss issues raised by the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">In short, the likely reader of the report will have a much greater ability to understand and assess the report, and the technical matters with which it deals, than an ordinary member of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The potential reader would thus be in a good position to determine whether a statement in the report about an attribute of one device carried with it an implication that the other device did not have that attribute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The reader would also pick up that the report was dealing only with intelligibility and not with the overall attributes of the two devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">GENERAL FINDINGS OF FACT 
 Markets for acoustic shock protection devices
 At the time of the comparison report test (May 2005) there were two types of call centres that were potential markets: those conducted by Telstra and the general market conducted by entities other than Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Telstra made up approximately one third of the overall market and the other entities approximately two thirds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Since December 2001 Polaris had been the sole supplier to Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">That arrangement was to have come to an end in December 2004, but in fact continued until mid 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">SoundShield was also sold widely in the general market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Dynamic and Plantronics developed the M15D device during 2005 with a view to it competing in the Telstra and general markets for acoustic shock protection devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">The name ADRO was often used to describe the M15D because the ADRO software that had been developed by Dynamic for use in hearing aids was later used in the M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Dynamic and Plantronics were aware that the Telstra RFT would be issued in 2005, and Plantronics intended to submit a tender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Standards, guidelines and specifications
 Telstra's TT4 specification contained a range of technical requirements which acoustic shock protection devices had to satisfy if they were to be purchased for use in Telstra's call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">It required the output of the devices to be limited to 85dB SPL (see [70]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The stated intent of TT4 was to minimise the symptoms of acoustic shock whilst maintaining speech intelligibility of not less than 90% with background voice chatter to 55dBA and with acoustic treatment to provide 49dB acoustic attenuation between adjacent workstations: clauses 3 and 5.2.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The parties were at odds as to whether the intelligibility requirement was operative at the time of the test the subject of the comparison report (May 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Dynamic maintained that, on Polaris' pleading, the requirement did not come into existence until December 2005, when Telstra's RFT was published and introduced it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Dynamic said that prior to that, 90% intelligibility was only an objective or recommendation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">I do not think that is the effect of the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Paragraph 10C of the statement of claim alleges that Telstra's RFT "included a requirement, as specified in TT4", that any device supplied to Telstra must satisfy the intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The copy of TT4 in evidence, issued in June 2001, contains the intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The copy of Telstra's RFT in evidence is incomplete, but I would infer from clause 1.1 of Schedule 9, which requires products supplied to meet "the requirements of the specifications and addendums provided", that the provisions of TT4 formed part of the specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">"Specification" is defined by reference to a Schedule that is not part of the document in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">I proceed on the basis that the intelligibility requirement was in place in May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">In May 2005 Australian Standard S004, administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, required the output of acoustic shock protection devices to be limited to 118dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">S004 is a mandatory standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It does not have an intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">G616 was published in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">It is a non-binding general Australian guideline for acoustic safety for telephone equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">As a condition of a device being marketed as an acoustic shock protection device, it imposes an acoustic limit of 102dBA SPL at DRP measured by the use of pulsed tones over a time interval of 125 milliseconds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The symbol dBA is explained at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">SPL means Sound Pressure Level and DRP means (ear) Drum Reference Point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Shortly after Polaris entered into the 2001 contract with Telstra, Telstra relaxed its limiting requirements for Polaris by five decibels (TT4+5) (ie 90dB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Details of the relaxation were not published.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In the weeks preceding the 10 May 2005 comparison test Dynamic and Plantronics made enquiries with a view to discovering the settings used on the SoundShield device in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Testing and trialling M15D
 In developing M15D Dynamic and Plantronics undertook testing through a technical testing organisation, Trillium Technology Pty Ltd (Trillium), for the purpose of determining whether the device complied with the specific technical requirements of the relaxed form of TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">This did not involve intelligibility testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Trillium reported that M15D complied with TT4+5 for acoustic limiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">At some time after May 2005 Plantronics carried out two call centre trials of M15D, including centres which used SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">One trial was done in Australia and the other in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">On 10 May 2005 Dynamic undertook the speech intelligibility test the subject of the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The test used a Plantronics H51-TT3 headset with each of the devices set to the lowest limiting setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Headset profile 1 was used in SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The combination of lowest limiting setting and headset profile 1 in SoundShield was its general market mode and not that used in Telstra call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Similarly, the lowest limiting setting of M15D was its proposed general market mode and not the proposed Telstra mode.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The testing used the same input levels for each device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Before carrying out this test, Professor Blamey did a pre-test for intelligibility with himself as the subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">This test is considered in more detail at [161]-[165].</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Testing SoundShield
 In January 2006 Mr Fisher tested SoundShield Mk1 (the model used in the comparison test) and a more recent model at both the limiting setting required by Telstra (TT4+5) and at the highest limiting setting of 95dB, with background noise levels of 55 and 65dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">He found an average intelligibility across all conditions of 96%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The intelligibility scores were reported as phonemes correct and not whole word correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In July 2007 Mr Fisher again tested SoundShield Mk1 on the same basis as the January 2006 test, except that the intelligibility scores were reported as whole word as well as phonemes correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The results were 97% correct on monosyllabic words, using phonemic scoring, and 93% correct using whole word scoring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Set to TT4+5 the device met Telstra's intelligibility requirement under both scoring methods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">In October 2007 Professor Newell did a test of SoundShield Mk1 on substantially the same basis as Mr Fisher's July 2007 test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The end results of the test appear from the following table which also shows Mr Fisher's tests and Dynamic's test: Condition 1 2 3 4 Background Noise Level 55 dBA 55 dBA 55 dBA 65 dBA Device Direct to Plantronics H51 TT3 SS MK1 TT4+5dB &amp;

 In July 2005 Plantronics carried out a comparison of SoundShield and M15D in a call centre environment with 12 subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">There was very little difference between the responses of the two devices, though SoundShield scored better on overall receive quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">In August 2005, as part of his work in the development of M15D, Mr Dickson carried out tests of two settings of M15D, two settings of SoundShield and one setting of another device, and measured their respective output levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The graph recording the results showed much the same output levels for M15D and SoundShield as in the comparison test (91.7 and 91.4dB SPL at DRP respectively).</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The SoundShield device was that used in the May 2005 comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Version 13a of the ADRO software was used in the August 2005 test of M15D whereas version 1.10a was used in the May test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Mr Dickson said there were minor differences between those two versions of the software, which did not affect output levels or speech intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Thus, he said, the graph showed the same output levels for the devices that would have applied in May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In 2006 Mr Fisher tested three devices for acoustic level: the M15D, what has been called "the technically equivalent device" to that used in the comparison report (DM15), and the SoundShield Mk1, all in combination with a Plantronics H51 headset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">He observed that the DM15 increased its output when the background noise level increased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">This was a test applying pulsed tones according to the G616 method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">It did not involve speech input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">The DM15 technically equivalent device was delivered to Polaris pursuant to a consent order of the Court made on 26 April 2006 under Order 15A rule 12 of the Rules that the respondents produce to Polaris for inspection and analysis the M15D device used in the carrying out of the May 2005 comparison test or a technically equivalent device to that used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In February 2008 Mr McNeill carried out a measurement of what he called the "acoustic limit for speech" for a M15D and a SoundShield, using a Plantronics H51N-TT3 headset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The two devices were set to the same settings as were used in the test for the comparison report: limiting mode 1 for SoundShield and limiting mode 3 for M15D (the setting with the least amount of limiting).</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The results are set out in the table below: 
 Polaris SoundShield Plantronics M15D Instantaneous Peak 107.8 dBSPL 107.4 dBSPL Maximum of 125ms RMS Average 96.3 dBSPL 94.7 dBSPL 5s RMS Average 87.1 dBSPL 86.6 dBSPL Active Speech Level 87.1 dBSPL 87.2 dBSPL 
 Technical matters
 The measurement of limits, inputs and outputs in acoustic terms uses the unit dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">These are units used to measure sound pressure level as a ratio compared to a known reference level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">There are different kinds of dBs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">As already indicated, one of them, dBA, is typically used for measuring sound in the environment, and so is used for OH&amp;S limits in factories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Professor Blamey said there were four or five other types of dB that appear in the material before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">They express different concepts and are not directly comparable without an appropriate translation factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">It is therefore important to identify the precise concept in use to ensure that any comparison is meaningful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Limits, inputs and outputs in acoustic terms can be measured in different ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Thus the points of measurement may differ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The point may be in the environment (free field) expressed as dBA, ear reference point (ERP) and drum reference point (DRP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Measurements can be made over different time intervals (for example, 125ms, 32ms and instantaneous).</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">These differences are reflected in Table 7.3 of TT4 (page 38).</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Again it is important to identify and use comparable parameters of measurement in order for comparisons and observations about acoustic limits, inputs and outputs to be meaningful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The lowest limiting setting prescribed by TT4 as it operated in 2005, in order to avoid hearing damage to a call centre operator, was 88dB, relaxed for Polaris to 88dB + 5dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">To achieve that outcome when SoundShield was used in TT4 mode, the device was set to limiting mode 2, which imposed a limit of about 90dB, and headset profile 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">That profile was developed specifically to comply with the requirements of TT4 and was not made available to the general market, which did not require it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">In the general market (95dB), limiting mode 1 was used for SoundShield by most non-Telstra customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">For the Plantronics H51 headset, profile 1 was the correct profile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">That was also the case with the Plantronics H51 TT3 headset, when used in the general market mode.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">(This headset could be set to either mode.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">) During 2005 there were two alternative settings for the M15D which were programmed into each device separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">These were the G616 (general market) mode which used the least amount of limiting, and a TT4 mode.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">During 2005 both were in the process of development and testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In the testing for the comparison report the M15D was used in its general market mode, as was SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Both modes in the M15D were achieved by the operation of software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">This included Xenica speech processing software developed by Dynamic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The G616 mode software versions of the Xenica software had the suffix 'a' and the TT4 mode versions had the suffix 'b'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">A numbering system was used to identify the version of the software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Thus version 1.9 preceded version 1.10a and 10b (the versions under development and testing during 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">There were slight changes between release 1.10a and release 1.13a of the M15D, but they had no impact on the way the software dealt with speech inputs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The comparison report testing was of speech with simulated background noise and no other signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">CONSIDERATION 
 Lowest limiting setting representation
 A difference in the limiting settings?</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">It is not disputed that Dynamic represented that the testing of the two devices at their lowest limiting settings provided an appropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The s 52 contravention pleaded is that the lowest limiting setting at which SoundShield was tested was significantly lower than that for M15D, and the test results consequently conveyed a misleading assessment of the comparative performance capabilities of the SoundShield device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">This is particularised as follows: 
(a) SoundShield has four settings, namely 80dB, 85dB, 90dB and 95dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">The lowest limiting setting is 80dB, and it was to the lowest limiting setting that the comparison report states that the device was set.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">However the longer form of the comparison report (dated 31 May 2005) states that during the test the device was set at "Limiter Setting 1", which is 95dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">(b) M15D has an absolute acoustic ceiling, and therefore a lowest limiting setting, of 102dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Mr Guest's initial complaint seems to have been that the report wrongly said that SoundShield was set to 80dB, which was its "lowest limiting setting", whereas it was in fact set to 95dB, which was its "least limiting setting" (ie setting 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">On Professor Blamey's evidence, which I accept, there is no difference between "lowest limiting setting" and "least limiting setting".</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Both mean the setting that provides the least limiting, namely 95dB, being the setting chosen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">In any event, Polaris' case was not conducted on the basis of Mr Guest's initial understanding of the position, but on the basis that SoundShield was tested on a limiting setting of 95dB whereas M15D was tested on a limiting setting of 102dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Polaris' contention was that a louder sound was heard on the M15D, which would enhance intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">This was the way Mr Guest put Polaris' complaint in his second affidavit: the M15D device used in the comparison test had an acoustic ceiling of at least 7dB more than SoundShield, and this difference "would have resulted in the device with the higher limit being easier to hear with ie have higher intelligibility".</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">As appears from [70], the voluntary G616 standard prescribes an upper limit of 102dBA SPL at DRP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">It was common ground that SoundShield's lowest limiting setting was setting 1 or the 95dB setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The M15D was a pre-release prototype.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The M15D ultimately released to the market was advertised as having a limit of 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Mr Gherbaz and Mr McNeill both said the M15D used in the comparison test had a lowest limiting setting of 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Thus, says Polaris, the comparison was between SoundShield with limiting of 95dBA and the M15D with limiting of 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">This comparison was said to be unfair because the M15D provided less limiting, and thus the listener received more sound than a listener to SoundShield, "with a resultant likely effect on intelligibility" --- the SoundShield caused sound to be heard more quietly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Polaris relied on Professor Newell's evidence to establish these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The respondents relied on Mr McNeill's test, which is described at [83].</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">They said this showed that both devices were limiting speech signals at the same level: around 95dBA SPL at DRP (94.7 for M15D and 96.3 for SoundShield) measured at 125ms RMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Polaris took issue with the relevance of Mr McNeill's test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">It said that although he described the test as "a measurement of the acoustic limit for speech" of the two devices, it was not that, but a measurement of their outputs with a single 100mV input, which did not test the limiting of the devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">In cross-examination Mr McNeill accepted that he had measured the devices' acoustic outputs at the ear drum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">He was not trying to verify compliance with any specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">He was trying to reproduce the conditions of the Dynamic test to verify that it was fair in that both headsets were putting out "similar output levels, acoustic levels".</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">In my view Mr McNeill's test does not displace the prima facie 7dB gap between SoundShield's limiting of 95dBA and M15D's limiting of 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Putting the matter another way, the test does not establish that the M15D tested by Dynamic had the same limit as the SoundShield tested, namely 95dBA as opposed to its published limit of 102dBA, the limit Mr Gherbaz, and Mr McNeill in another connection (see [93]), said it had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">As Mr McNeill conceded, it was not a test of the acoustic limits for speech, but of output levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">As appears at [96], Mr McNeill was trying to reproduce the conditions of the Dynamic test to verify that it was fair in that both headsets were putting out similar output levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Polaris drew attention to many respects in which Mr McNeill's test did not replicate Dynamic's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">I mention only one of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The Dynamic test was done with background noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Mr McNeill's was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">This is an important difference for present purposes because, as Mr McNeill pointed out, it was a feature of the M15D (not shared by SoundShield) that when it detected an increase in ambient background noise, it attempted to increase the output volume level "so long as that does not exceed the limiting profile selected".</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In other words, the measured output for the M15D in the absence of background noise is likely to be lower than the output in otherwise the same conditions but with background noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">As Polaris points out, this would explain the difference in perceived loudness recorded by the subjects in the Dynamic test (Figure 2), with the M15D increasing its output in background noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">More importantly, for present purposes, because a higher output could be achieved in different test conditions (with background noise), Mr McNeill's test is not a test of any limit of the M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The respondents also relied on Mr Dickson's August 2005 test described at [80], which showed much the same output levels for M15D and SoundShield --- 91.7 and 91.4dB SPL at DRP respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Mr Dickson's test was of the same character as Mr McNeill's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">It tested output levels and not acoustic limits for speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">He agreed that what his graph demonstrated was output measurements, and that they did not directly give any information about the acoustic limits of the devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">His test was done without background noise, and he agreed with Mr McNeill that the M15D had attributes that improved loudness in noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Confirmation that Mr Dickson tested for output levels and not limiting levels is contained in the note of a telephone call made by Professor Blamey in December 2005 to Dr Harvey Dillon of NAL in response to an enquiry as to the limiting level for the M15D tested in May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The note is in part as follows: 
 
 HD indicated that he wanted to discuss the SoundShield/ADRO study, and that he had seen a copy of the document that [Dynamic] had supplied to Plantronics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">HD asked what was the limiting level for the ADRO device tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">He inferred that the poorer performance of the SoundShield device may have been caused by using a lower limiting level than was used for the ADRO device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">
 

 
 
 PB replied that the limiting levels for the devices had not been measured or compared as part of the study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The output levels for the two devices had been measured and matched at the start of the study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">SoundShield was set to the typical settings used in Australian call centres as stated in the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The ADRO device was set to a similar output level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">
 

 It was on receipt of the enquiry from Dr Dillon that Professor Blamey asked Mr Dickson to provide him with the measurements of the output levels used in the May comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Mr Dickson's graph was provided to Professor Blamey in response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Professor Blamey said it showed output levels or spectra for speech averaged over 10 seconds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">It is clear therefore that the measurement referred to in the fifth sentence of the passage quoted at [100] is Mr Dickson's, and that it was not a measurement of limiting levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The respondents have not established, by resort to Mr McNeill's or Mr Dickson's tests, that in the Dynamic test both devices had more or less the same acoustic limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">SoundShield was tested on a setting of 95dBA and M15D on 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Professor Blamey agreed that his statement that the acoustic limit for speech for the M15D in the measurements performed at Plantronics was 95dB SPL at DRP was based on Mr McNeill's test and that he was not aware of any other test "for acoustic limit for speech" for the M15D that had been performed for this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">He also agreed that the only tests for the output levels for the devices were those of Mr McNeill and Mr Dickson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Polaris claimed that Dynamic could have done a "fair" test by setting both devices to TT4 limiting settings or TT4+5dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">In this connection it relied on an email from Trillium (Mr Hecker) to Plantronics (Mr Gherbaz) of 20 April 2005 in which Mr Hecker expressed "concern" that Plantronics was "trying to benchmark against something that isn't TT4".</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Mr Hecker said he had tested SoundShield to TT4 and it appeared to be "behaving properly".</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Polaris also relied on an email from Mr Dickson to Mr McNeill of 29 April 2005 which disclosed that the former was "currently finalising two versions of Tecate/Xenica software".</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">One was M15D version 1.10a to compete with SoundShield on non-Telstra setting, and the other, version 1.10b, to compete with SoundShield "for full TT4 compliance test at Trillium".</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">On this basis Polaris contended that Dynamic could have done a test comparing like with like, but chose not to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">This, it said, left the reader of the report to infer that the lowest limiting setting was the same for each device, when it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">That was what was misleading about the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">In this same connection Polaris relies on Mr McNeill's evidence in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">He was asked what he understood Mr Hecker meant in the 20 April 2005 email that Plantronics was "trying to benchmark against something that isn't TT4".</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">He replied: 
 
 this comes back to the relaxation of the space that Polaris had negotiated with Telstra, and if we were benchmarking our product with a limiting profile of TT4 against SoundShield, with a limiting setting of TT4+5, then they wouldn't match.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">They wouldn't be a fair benchmark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">
 

 Dynamic propounded three reasons for rejecting Polaris' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The first was that "both devices were set at the lowest limiting setting", which meant that the volume of the sound heard by the listener was least restricted by the devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">It is true that SoundShield was set to its lowest limiting setting of 95dB and that M15D was set to its lowest limiting setting of 102dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">However, Polaris' grievance is that the report misleadingly represented that the two devices were set to the same lowest limiting setting, when they were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">As appears above, I have concluded that they were set to different settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Dynamic's second reason for asserting that Polaris' claim must fail was that both devices were set to the lowest setting each was capable of giving for speech, namely 95dB, which on both is the point at which their speech limiting capacities commence to operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">As I have found, the devices were not set at the same 95dB setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Dynamic's third reason was that both devices were tested by measurement of their sound output level at 91.4dB SPL at DRP (M15D) and 91.7dB SPL at DRP (SoundShield) in the conditions used, the effect of which was that the sound used was below the sound limiting capacities in each device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">This contention is based on Mr Dickson's measurements of December 2005 and his supporting graph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">As appears from what I have said at [99], Mr Dickson, as he conceded, was measuring outputs and not the acoustic limits of the devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Dynamic's third reason is itself predicated on a sound output level measurement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Dynamic's other related submissions founder on the failure to distinguish between maximum sound outputs and acoustic limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Polaris' complaint relates to the latter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">The admitted representation is that the testing of the two devices at their lowest limiting settings provided an appropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The representation is said to be misleading because the lowest limiting setting at which SoundShield was tested was significantly lower than that for M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">This does not involve a comparison of maximum sound outputs, but of acoustic limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Thus Dynamic's assertion that Mr Dickson's evidence that both devices produced the same level of sound to listeners rebutted Polaris' contention that the M15D was tested at a higher volume than SoundShield, does not meet Polaris' point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Similarly, Dynamic's concluding submission that Polaris has failed to establish that the devices were tested "at unequal volumes" also misses the point, based as it is on Mr McNeill's and Mr Dickson's tests of sound outputs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Plantronics relied on a passage in Mr McNeill's second affidavit in which he said that from his role in leading the design team for the M15D, he was aware that "the limiting regime provided for by limiting mode 3 causes the 125ms RMS speech average for the M15D to be limited to 95dB SPL at the drum reference point".</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Mr McNeill provided no reasoning or explanation to support this bald assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">He was not in this affidavit relying on his February 2008 test, which had since his earlier affidavit been subjected to criticism by Mr Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 159 FCR 397 at [108] the Full Court said: 
 
 unless a witness states in his or her evidence in chief the grounds and reasoning that have led to the opinion, the opinion is valueless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Before the Court can assess the value of an opinion, it must know the facts on which it is based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">If the opinion is based on irrelevant facts or facts that are clearly not going to be proved, the opinion is likely to be valueless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">It should not be for a cross-examiner to endeavour to elicit the facts or assumptions upon which an opinion is expressed, and it would be unfair to leave such matters to the cross-examiner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Except in a straightforward, uncomplicated case, where the facts are admitted or otherwise readily identified, opinion evidence would normally be rejected under s 135 if the facts or assumptions upon which the opinion is based are not expressly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">
 

 
 
 It is for the Court to judge the reliability of, and the weight to be given to, particular evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Opinion evidence, like any other evidence, must be comprehensible and reach conclusions that are rationally based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The process of inference or reasoning that leads to conclusions ought to be stated or revealed in a way that enables the conclusions to be tested and a judgment to be made about their reliability and the weight that should be given to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">
 

 Polaris urged me to attach no weight to Mr McNeill's statement of his "awareness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">This is far from being a "straightforward, uncomplicated case", and the evidence in issue is of central importance to the lowest limiting setting issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Mr McNeill's assertion amounts to no more than that he knows something because of his expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">I attach no weight to the assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Loudness and intelligibility
 The difference between the two limiting settings was relied on by Polaris to show that louder sound was being heard on the M15D, which would have enhanced intelligibility compared with the sound heard at a lower level on SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Polaris relied primarily on Professor Newell's evidence to establish this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">In his initial report (3 November 2007) Professor Newell said that a device set to an acoustic limit of 100 or 102dBA SPL at DRP will result in "potentially better speech intelligibility ... especially in background noise" than one set to "an average maximum of 95dB SPL at DRP" (presumably 95dBA SPL at DRP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Polaris' solicitors later asked him whether, assuming everything else about the two devices was the same, the difference in speech intelligibility would be significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">His answer was that, if three conditions were met, it would be significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">The first was that the two devices were identical in all respects other than the acoustic limiting level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">The second was that the devices were driven to a level in which there was significant limiting of the speech by the device with the lower acoustic limit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">The third was that the background noise in the room and on the line was of a significant level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Professor Newell's answer is theoretical and unhelpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">He makes no attempt to apply it to the facts of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Polaris did not point to any evidence that Professor Newell's first condition was satisfied, namely that the two devices were identical in all respects other than the acoustic limiting level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Indeed the evidence disclosed many respects in which they differed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">The only matter it relied on in relation to the second condition was that in the comparison report test both devices were in limiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">That does not establish that SoundShield was driven to a level at which there was significant limiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">After all, the SoundShield setting was the least limiting setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">As to the third condition, Professor Newell did not identify the level at which background noise becomes significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">So we are left with Professor Newell's default position (where the conditions are not satisfied) that a device set to 100 or 102dBA will not result in significantly better speech intelligibility than one set at 95dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">The difficulty with Polaris' case on this point is that it did not carry out a test of the two devices with speech input, and thus was unable to show whether there was "significant limiting" of SoundShield, or more generally whether intelligibility in fact increased as a result of M15D's extra 7dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">The respondents relied on Mr Fisher's test of January 2006 to show that a 5dB difference in limiting in SoundShield MK1 had no effect on intelligibility in test conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The results of the test using ten subjects is shown in the table below: 
 Noise level = 55 dBA Noise level = 65 DBA
 
 TT4 General TT4 General Subject # % Correct % Correct % Correct % Correct 1 97 97 100 93 2 100 93 100 97 3 90 93 90 93 4 100 93 100 97 5 100 87 100 93 6 90 97 97 97 7 90 90 93 97 8 90 97 100 100 9 100 97 93 100 10 100 97 97 100 Average 96 94 97 97 
 Table 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Speech intelligibility scores for
SoundShield MK1 (% correct)
 
 "TT4" in the second and fourth columns indicates limiting of 90dB and "General" in the third and fifth columns indicates limiting of 95dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">If it were correct that an extra 5dB enhances intelligibility, one would expect that to be shown by the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Instead, in the test done with a noise level of 55dBA, the average percentage correct at 95dB is lower than that at 90dB, and with a noise level of 65dBA, the average scores are the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Mr Fisher's evidence contradicted the proposition that hearing a louder sound on the M15D would have enhanced intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">He rejected the proposition put to him in cross examination that "for the purpose of providing the best speech intelligibility, a louder sample will be more intelligible than a softer".</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">He agreed that one reason for this was that the louder sample may be distorted by the device that is reproducing the sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">He also said that as sound gets louder and louder, the listener doesn't understand it as well; that is to say, intelligibility decreases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">His opinion was that speech intelligibility is best at a speech level of around 73dBA in the free field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">If there was background noise of 55dB, intelligibility would be best at 67dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">The topic was not touched on in re-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Polaris submitted that Mr Fisher was dealing with face to face and not telephone conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">His reference to distortion shows that he was initially dealing with telephone conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Then he shifted to face to face (free field) conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">But it is apparent from a reading of ensuing responses that Mr Fisher was making the loudness point in relation to speech generally, and not limiting it to face to face conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Mr Guest's evidence was not entirely consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">In his second affidavit he said he had listened to SoundShield set at each of its different limiting settings, all 5dB apart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">He said a five dB increase was clearly noticeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Even with all other settings appropriately adjusted, SoundShield's intelligibility improved each time the acoustic limit was increased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">The 95dB setting was the one easiest to hear with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The account Mr Guest gave in cross-examination about the test he carried out was to a different effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Here he said he listened to the M15D and SoundShield and "the M15D sounded louder to me".</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">When pressed as to why he had not mentioned this comparative test in his affidavit (which referred only to testing SoundShield), he departed from the claim that he had listened to M15D as well as SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">It was put to him that he had not in fact listened to M15D to make a comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">He replied that he made the comparison "based upon knowing that SoundShield had an absolute limit of 95dB and either the testing of Fisher at 102 and/or the published information of Plantronics".</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">He ultimately accepted that his opinion about intelligibility was simply based on two numbers --- 95dB and 102dB and nothing else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Mr Guest's evidence was unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">He claimed to have conducted a test that he had not in fact carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">His evidence does not establish that the 5dB difference between SoundShield and M15D increased the intelligibility produced by the latter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Mr Guest is not an expert in speech, audiology or acoustics, and did not pretend to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">On the other hand, Professor Newell is an expert audiologist, and Mr Guest's evidence cannot be used to fill the gaps caused by Polaris' failure to satisfy the conditions attached to Professor Newell's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">I accept Mr Fisher's evidence that loudness does not necessarily increase intelligibility, and Professor Newell's evidence that it does so only if certain conditions are satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">There is no evidence that they were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">However, even accepting the test Mr Guest actually did (ie listening to SoundShield alone), it says nothing as to whether a 102dB limit on a different device would be easier to hear with than 95dB on SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Mr Fisher's evidence shows that one cannot by extrapolation from 95dB upwards expect to achieve greater intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">As part of their attack on Mr Guest's evidence the respondents relied on the contents of his email to Dynamic's former Chief Executive Officer, Elaine Saunders, of 16 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Mr Guest asked Dr Saunders for the acoustic limiting level for the M15D used in the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Mr Guest told her that the 7dB difference between SoundShield's acoustic limit of 95dB and the European version of M15D (Polaris did not have an Australian version) meant that it had the "theoretical potential to be more intelligible than SoundShield, though he doubted that "in actual use it is effectively more intelligible".</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">In cross examination, after attempts to explain away what he had written, he eventually conceded that what he had said was "true", and that he doubted whether in actual use M15D would be effectively more intelligible as a result of the extra 7dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Mr McNeill's statement that SoundShield's limiting setting 1 produced a louder output than settings two, three and four speaks only of loudness, and not intelligibility for speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Polaris posed the correct question to Professor Newell: whether the difference in speech intelligibility would be significant in the circumstances posited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">However his heavily conditional answer did not provide the answer Polaris needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">Nor does Polaris derive assistance from Mr McNeill's observation that if Plantronics was benchmarking the M15D with a limiting profile of TT4 against SoundShield with a limiting profile of TT4+5, there "wouldn't be a fair benchmark".</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Again, this opinion was based on Mr McNeill's earlier statement about loudness or output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Even if he had gone on to relate loudness/output to speech intelligibility, I would have preferred Professor Newell's evidence recorded at [112].</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">He has had some 30 years experience working and teaching in audiology, including speech intelligibility generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">I have earlier referred to the respondents' submission that Professor Newell's evidence on certain topics was not that of an independent expert because of Mr Fisher's involvement in the testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">His intelligibility for speech evidence was not one of those topics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Professor Newell's expertise in audiology and intelligibility for speech is much greater than Mr McNeill's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Polaris has not established that the difference between the lowest limiting settings of the devices would have made M15D more intelligible than SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">Lowest limiting setting - conclusion
 Polaris has established that in the comparison test SoundShield's lowest limiting setting was 95dBA and M15D's was 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">However, it has not established that the difference between the two settings made speech heard through the M15D significantly more intelligible than that through SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Thus it has not established that the testing of the two devices at their lowest limiting settings provided an inappropriate comparative basis for testing intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">To use the language of Polaris' submission, the 7dB difference did not confer a relevant "benefit" on the M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">The same applies to Mr Fisher's 5dB difference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Ethics approval representation
 The representation, which is admitted by the respondents, is that the research that resulted in the comparison report was covered by ethics approval from the Ethics Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">Polaris contends that this was misleading because the research was not covered by ethics approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The confidential particulars provided throw no light on why the research was not covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Polaris propounded this claim on the basis that the research was covered by ethics approval, but the approval was obtained by amendment after publication of the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">In my view this claim has no substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">On 11 June 2003 Dynamic applied for ethics approval for "investigations with digital signal processing strategies in audio applications for normally hearing listeners and individuals using hearing aids".</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">On 7 July 2003 approval was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">The project was given the number 03/529H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The approval letter stated that the Committee required an annual progress report, and that any proposed amendments to the protocol that accompanied the application required its approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">A final report was required at the conclusion of the research.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">On 23 June 2006 Dynamic wrote to the Committee stating that it would like to use university students in the listening experiments and pay them a fixed hourly rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">It asked the Committee to confirm that the recruitment of normally hearing listeners in this way was acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">On 27 July 2006 the Committee replied requesting clarification of the purpose of the tests on normal hearing volunteers and why they were to be conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">On 30 July Dynamic provided the information sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">On 10 August 2006 the Committee wrote to Dynamic as follows: 
 
 I am writing in response to your request for an amendment for the above project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">
 

 
 
 Your letter of 30 July 2006 makes clear the aims of the project, and is consistent with your original application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The letter, however, does not mention the type of study that was recently brought to our attention by your legal advisors, Griffith Hack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">That study compared two competing commercial devices, and there was an implication that the results would be used in the marketing of those devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">
 

 
 
 The Committee has requested further clarification of this part of the project before approving the amendment requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">
 

 By letter of 18 August 2006 Dynamic informed the Committee of the comparison report, Polaris' complaint that the report was misleading and that the study was not covered by project 03/529H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Dynamic said that "the most effective way for us to counter" would be to have a letter confirming that it did have cover for the study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">On 25 August 2006 the Committee informed Dynamic that the testing of a variety of devices using normal hearing subjects was covered by the approval for project 03/529H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Later on the same day Dynamic emailed the Committee thanking it for the response, and posing another question: 
 
 It is our opinion that the research study in which normally hearing listeners compared speech intelligibility and sound quality judgments for the SoundShield and the M15D devices, that was conducted in 2005 by the investigators listed in the application and reports for Project 03/529H falls within this scope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">Do you agree?</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">
 

 The Committee's response on the same day was in the affirmative: 
 
 That particular component of the study was covered by the HREC approval for the abovenamed study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">
 

 The above account discloses that there was no amendment or change to the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">There was no retrospective approval of the study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">The Committee's final communication makes clear that the study specified in Dynamic's letter of 25 August 2006 was covered ab initio by the approval granted in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Polaris drew attention to the fact that Dynamic had not replied to the query raised in the Committee's letter of 10 August about the results of the study being used in the marketing of the two competing commercial devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Dynamic's letter of 18 August explained the litigation context, and asked for a letter confirming that it did have approval for the study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">The Committee was obviously satisfied with the response, and provided two letters of approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Polaris has not established that the ethics approval representation was misleading or deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Test set up representations
 Dynamic admits the representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Plantronics denies them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">However, in its closing submissions Plantronics said that in view of Dynamic's admissions, it would make no submissions on whether the representations were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">In par 6 of the statement of claim Dynamic is alleged to be the publisher and distributor of the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">Plantronics is alleged to have requested and approved the publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">I find the representations were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Receive gain setting --- input signal
 The receive gain setting adjusts the level of amplification of the incoming signal, so that lower level signals are made louder and higher level signals are reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">This is done in order to improve intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Both Mr Fisher and Mr McNeill likened receive gain setting to a motor vehicle's gears, with SoundShield being a manual car with three gears (LOW, MID and HIGH) and M15D an automatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">The appropriate receive gain setting depends on the input signal to which the device is exposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Acoustic shock protection devices are installed between the telephone and the headset of the call centre operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The input signal to a device is the output signal from the telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">It was Polaris' case that exposing SoundShield to a higher input signal than that for which it was programmed causes distortion which in turn decreases intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Polaris' Administrator Programming Manual (Manual) describes the device's settings by reference to the type of telephone in use rather than as a particular measured output in millivolts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Five telephones are listed in Appendix 1, all with the MID receive level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The Manual states that if the receive setting for the host equipment is not listed in the Appendix, the setting must be tested and created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">In other words, there is no general mode setting for non-listed host equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Mr Fisher's evidence was that the LOW setting was designed for input signal levels up to about 15mV, the MID setting for signals up to 40mV, 50mV as a maximum, and the HIGH setting for signals in excess of 50mV up to 272mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Mr Thompson's evidence of average inputs was 12mV for LOW, 33mV for MID and 80mV for HIGH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">The comparison report testing was done with a 100mV input signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">There is no evidence as to the basis for the selection of this signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Professor Blamey said Dynamic used the MID receive gain setting for the SoundShield, based on information received from a call centre the name of which he provided on a confidential basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">His evidence was not clear, because he also referred to an email which stated that the appropriate setting "varies by agent", the agent being the operator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">He also said that the information as to the MID setting "may have come from another source or an additional source to this".</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">It is not clear whether "this" referred to the call centre or the email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Professor Blamey accepted that when the comparison test was done, Dynamic did not know what Polaris' recommendations were in relation to the receive gain for the input signal used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Mr Gherbaz explained what was meant by "varies by agent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">He said that at this particular (confidential) site the agents had a number of headsets, and as they moved from desk to desk, the supervisor would reprogram the SoundShields, and so "there was quite a bit of variation from setting to setting from SoundShield to SoundShield".</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Mr Gherbaz also said that he did not know the receive gain setting for this particular customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Mr McNeill gave evidence on a confidential basis of global studies that led Plantronics engineering community worldwide to select an input that supported Dynamic's selection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">However he did not say that was why the 100mV input was selected for the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">Clause 5.3.2 of TT4 lists several telephones whose requirements "are to be accommodated by an acoustic protection device".</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">They include Nortel P-phones, Exicom BT450 and Alcatel TF200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Polaris arranged for Trillium to test the Nortel P-phones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Mr Thompson converted Trillium's measurements of the output of the phones to millivolts --- between 33 and 36mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">Mr Fisher carried out a similar test of the Exicom and Alcatel phones and found that their speech signal level was typically 25mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">Professor Blamey took issue with this measurement on the ground that it assumed, without justification, that the output of handsets can be compared directly to the output of headsets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">He did not explain why this was so, or what a proper "indirect" comparison would show.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">I attach no weight to this unhelpful evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Mr Fisher said that the 100mV signal used by Dynamic was a particularly high input signal level, and that if SoundShield was exposed to that signal the most appropriate receive gain setting would be HIGH, as that would moderate the high input signal and avoid distortion of the signal which causes decreased intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">Professor Newell said while the 100mV input used by Dynamic was within the highest level of the specification in TT4 (see Table 5.9), it was generally recognised that such a level was unrealistic and never encountered in call centre equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">He was asked on what he based that opinion, and responded: 
 
 I base my view on data on receiver sensitivities (ie the sensitivity of the speakers in headsets and handsets).</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">This data is relevant because the SoundShield connects to either the headset or handset part of a telephone console in place of a direct connect headset or handset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">Headsets and handsets produce high sound levels when speech signals with an average level of 100 mV are applied to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Michael Fisher has calculated this average speech level to be equivalent to around 89 dBA SPL in the field which is well in excess of the average speech level people in call centres listen to which was found to be 77 dBA by Patel and Broughton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">None of the headset users in the Patel and Broughton study listened at a level as high as 89 dBA SPL in the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">It is the fact that people do not (or very rarely) listen to speech at these high average sound levels (ie 89 dBA SPL in the field) that tells me the input speech signal level (ie 100 mV) into these devices that causes such high sound levels is not being applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">
 

 The respondents relied on Table 5.9 in TT4 to justify the selection of the 100mV input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">It is a complicated document which is prefaced by the explanations in clause 5.2.8 --- "Levels at Input to Limiting Amplifier" which is in part as follows: 
 
 The limiter/headset combination must accommodate the signal levels at the interface to a typical range of CPE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">It is essential that correct operation be achieved with the typical range of inputs from the various CPE as tabulated below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">
 

 
 
 The unit will perform within specification for the range of levels below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">This may be achieved by the use of internally settable controls or by other means as determined by the manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">
 

 
CPE stands for Customer Premises Equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">The table, part of which is rendered below, includes columns dealing with "Level at input to limiter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Column 1 deals with CPE with low level output to limiter input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">Column 2 deals with CPE with mid level output to limiter input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Column 3 deals with high level output to limiter input.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">The introductory column describes the material in the numbered columns: 
 (Col 1) (Col 2) (Col 3) Long Term Max Active Speech ... 192mV RMS 272mV RMS 700mV RMS Long Term Mean Active Speech ... 48mV RMS 68mV RMS 175mV RMS Long Term Min Active Speech ... 12mV RMS 17mV RMS 44mV RMS 
The description of the table located at its foot is:
 
 
 Table of amplifier input levels available at the headset or handset port of the typical range of CPE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">CPE introduces a variable level between the input from the network and the port to which the amplifier is connected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">To be able to function with a range of CPE the amplifier/headset combination must have a range of settings, which can accommodate the level and wire function requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">The settings to accommodate the various CPE must be internal settings, which are not accessible in day to day operation ... Note: Column 3 requirement may not be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Check with Product Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">
 

 Professor Blamey's position was that because 100mV was within the range in the table as being typical ranges for telephones in use in Telstra's call centres, it was appropriate to have selected it as the input level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">He also said that because it was also within the range of all three columns (low, mid and high), the choice of the particular setting was "not particularly crucial".</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">In his oral evidence he expressed the view that the table "suggests that in every setting of the device which is designed to be used with typical telephones in call centres, the device ... should be able to accept 100mV input signal and achieve 90 per cent speech intelligibility with that input signal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">Professor Blamey accepted that 100mV was above the mid point in columns 1 and 2 (the mean or average signal level).</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Accordingly, the signal chosen was above the signal specified for the low to mid range for the mean active speech levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">These levels were what Mr Thompson called the levels "likely to be encountered".</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">For present purposes the only relevance of Table 5.9 is for the light it throws on input signals used in typical Australian call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">The comparison report test was not directed to ascertaining SoundShield's TT4 compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">It was not a test constructed so as to be able to do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">In view of other evidence, the table throws very little light on input levels in fact used in call centres, especially non-Telstra centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">There was no evidence that the table was used by any call centre or by any manufacturer of acoustic protection devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Professor Blamey's evidence about the confidential call centre's settings was confusing and unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">The settings were those identified in the exchange of emails referred to at [196].</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">They did not include the input signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">So the 100mV input did not come from the confidential call centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Polaris' own evidence was that the table's low, mid and high levels were not the source of SoundShield's three settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">The only clear evidence about a manufacturer's use of the table is that Mr Fisher consulted it when designing SoundShield, but did not ultimately use it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">His tests at Telstra call centres showed that the input levels encountered were considerably lower than those specified in the table, and accordingly SoundShield was modified to have a higher receive amplification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">There was no evidence that the table was part of Dynamic's decision-making process that led to the selection of the 100mV input signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">If the table offers any guidance as to inputs in call centres, the mean active speech levels therein would be the obvious ones to apply --- 48mV for LOW and 68mV for MID.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">Polaris' experts, Mr Fisher, Mr Thompson and Professor Newell, were clear that 100mV was a much higher input than that typically encountered in Australian call centres, though they did not all come up with the same range as to what was typical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Mr Thompson said that the relevant figures in the table are those listed against long term mean active speech level for which the table ascribes a value of 48mV RMS as the likely input to a device for low output CPE, and a value of 68mV RMS for mid level output CPE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">He treated the table as stating that the range of likely inputs to devices in call centres was 48-68mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Mr Thompson's opinion was based on columns 1 and 2 of the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Column 3 deals with "CPE with high level output to limiter input".</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">It has a footnote that "Column 3 requirement may not be required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Check with Product Manager".</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">There was no evidence as to the provenance of this note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">Mr Thompson's conclusion was that a 100mV input signal did not simulate the likely output signal from a telephone in a call centre in practice, which is instead in the range of 33-36mV, and is not within the likely range specified in the table (48-68mV).</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">Mr McNeill agreed with Polaris' witnesses that the receive gain settings were a matter for determination by the manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Professor Blamey agreed that in making decisions about receive gain settings for the comparison test, it would have been very useful to know whether Polaris made any use of Table 5.9 in its settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Polaris' Manual disclosed that the HIGH setting should be selected for hosts/consoles with a high output level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">Mr Thompson said that on a 100mV input the HIGH setting was the appropriate one, because on a MID setting there would very likely be overamplification and distortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">He agreed that he had not done a specific test to establish this, for want of the necessary equipment at Polaris' premises, but said that from measurements he was able to make, he could infer the likelihood of distortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">In cross-examination he said that if set on MID with a 100mV input, SoundShield would perform less satisfactorily than if set on HIGH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Professor Newell was of the same opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">He explained why: 
 
 A speech signal with an average level of 100 mV is a high level signal for a handset or direct connect headset to be exposed to as discussed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">As limiting amplifiers are designed to accept the same signal that are provided to headsets and handsets these are also high level signals for limiting amplifiers to be exposed to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">It therefore is appropriate that a limiting amplifier should be set to a HIGH receive setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">I am advised by Michael Fisher that this is the case for speech signals with average levels greater than 50 mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">
 

 
Asked why he regarded 100mV input as a high level signal, Professor Newell referred to the passage from his report quoted at [144] and said:
 
 
 As discussed above a speech signal with an average level of 100mV will produce very high sound levels (ie 89dBA free field equivalent) from standard handsets and headsets designed to directly connect to a telephone console.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">100mV is therefore a high level rather than a normal level from a telephone console.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">
 

 On the basis of the material summarised at [142]-[143] and [149]-[153] I find that Dynamic selected a high input signal that was not typically used in Australian call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Dynamic should have known from the Patel and Broughton article to which it referred in the comparison report, that 100mV was a high signal level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Patel and Broughton's measurements at 15 call centres in the United Kingdom showed a mean output of 77dBA, with 70% of the measurement output levels being within the 72-82dBA range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">The maximum measured level was 88dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Professor Blamey said that the mean of the output translated from 100mV to dBA was 84dBA, which he agreed was towards the upper end of the range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">Dynamic was aware of the importance of getting SoundShield's receive gain setting correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">It did not have a copy of the Manual, which would have disclosed the need for a HIGH setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">It did not seek to obtain the relevant information from Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Based on the evidence of Mr Thompson, Mr Fisher and Professor Newell, I find that the average input in typical Australian call centres was between 12 and 80mV: 12 for LOW, 33 for MID and 80 for HIGH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">On an input of 100mV, the appropriate setting was HIGH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Polaris' case was not simply that an input of 100mV was too high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">It was that if with that input SoundShield was set to the MID receive gain setting, it would be overdriven and would distort, with a consequent deleterious effect on intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">That would have been avoided had the HIGH receive gain setting been selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Has Polaris established that with a 100mV input, SoundShield will be overdriven and distort with an adverse effect on intelligibility for speech?</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">In his principal affidavit Professor Blamey said that before the test was administered to the eight subjects he inspected the set up of the experiment and checked the equipment as set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">He also listened to sound output of both devices in the settings that had been proposed and satisfied himself that they were appropriate for the use of both devices in a simulated call centre environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">Professor Blamey elaborated on this in the course of cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">It was put to him that he had not done a pre-test for intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">He disagreed: 
 
 The test I did, involved actually going through the whole protocol, so I listened to both devices, and the words that I heard were scored in the normal way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">So that could be interpreted as a pre-test for intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">
 

 
He said his scores had been recorded, but he no longer had the data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">He went on to say that the two devices were "very similar in loudness": one was slightly louder, though he had no way of knowing which it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">In re-examination he repeated that before the subjects were tested he sat in the booth and the protocol was run through with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">He agreed that: Many other tests, comparative and non-comparative, were in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">Most of them were more or less readily distinguishable from the Dynamic comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">The one test that cannot thus be put aside or distinguished is Professor Blamey's pre-test for intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">Obviously he used the same test set up as the eight subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">Although he was not asked about distortion, I infer from the fact that both devices appeared to be working, that he didn't hear anything to suggest that one was very different from the other, and that they were of similar loudness, though one was slightly louder, that there was no apparent distortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">I have taken into account that Professor Blamey has an interest in the outcome of the case, but I cannot reject his evidence on that ground alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">I have earlier said that I regard him as a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">He said it was standard practice to test the equipment prior to an experiment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">While Polaris criticised Professor Blamey's recollection of facts and detail as "unreliable", it did not attack his credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">It was not put that he had not carried out the pre-test for intelligibility or that he had fabricated the results of his experiment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">In any event, I accept that he did test the equipment and found it to be in working order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">I infer from the fact that he didn't hear anything to suggest that one device was very different from the other, and that they were of similar loudness, that neither was distorting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">In contrast to Professor Blamey's practical experiment, Polaris' expert evidence was largely of a theoretical character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">As indicated at [155], Mr Thompson's opinion that there would "very likely" be overamplification and distortion of SoundShield with a 100mV input on MID, was not based on any test to measure distortion on that input and that setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">Nor had he done any measurements that would demonstrate that SoundShield was capable of accepting a 100mV input set on HIGH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">He said both those measurements could have been carried out, but Polaris did not have the necessary facilities for that to be done at its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">He said that distortion is a well known effect which is measurable using a Distortion Analyser or a Spectrum Analyser, which he had used extensively to measure signal distortion in acoustic shock protection devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">The tentative nature of Mr Thompson's evidence on this issue is apparent from the following exchange in cross-examination: 
 
 And is it your view ... that if a 100 millivolt input voltage is used for SoundShield on the mid receive level, that the SoundShield will not perform satisfactorily?</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">--- No, that's not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">
 

 
 
 It is your view that if the SoundShield receives an input signal of 100 millivolt when it's on its mid receive level 2 it will perform satisfactorily?</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">--- This goes to the question of what you mean by 'satisfactorily'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">...
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">The question I've asked is whether or not the SoundShield, if it receives a 100mV signal when it's set in receive level 2, the mid receive setting, whether it would perform satisfactorily with that input voltage?</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">--- Less satisfactorily than compared when used in the high receive gain setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">
 

 Professor Newell spoke generally about overdriving (too high a signal), saying that its effect is that the device will distort the signal resulting in a reduction in the intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Applying that to the present case he said it was "reasonable to suggest" that SoundShield's poor intelligibility result was due to overdriving which caused it to distort the signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">In cross-examination Professor Newell said that if he had put in a 100mV signal, it would have been necessary to see whether SoundShield was being overdriven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">By this I took him to mean that it would have been necessary to carry out an appropriate test, perhaps using one of the analysers of which Mr Thompson spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">Mr Fisher's opinion that if SoundShield was exposed to a 100mV signal, the most appropriate receive gain setting was HIGH, as that would moderate the high input signal and avoid distortion causing decreased intelligibility, was theoretical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">He undertook no test with a 100mV signal on the MID setting, though he agreed he could have done this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">He relied on two matters for his opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">The first was his controversial interpretation of Mr McNeill's 2008 test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">The second was that he knew what SoundShield sounds like with an input level of 100mV, though he had not performed a test with subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">He said "I know what it sounds like and it doesn't sound good".</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Otherwise he simply asserted, based on "lots of ... knowledge in this area", that there is overamplification with a 100mV signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">Based on Professor Blamey's personal test carried out immediately before the comparison test with subjects, which is more persuasive than the Polaris evidence recorded at [166]-[168] for the reasons there given, I have concluded that Polaris has not established that at a 100mV input on MID receive level SoundShield is overdriven and distorts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">It was common ground that the relevance of distortion for present purposes lies in its adverse effect on speech intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">On that finding I am unable to hold that the test set up representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive for any of the reasons alleged in par 10I of the statement of claim to the extent those allegations depend on the input signal used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">I have considered whether, despite the above finding, I could uphold the contention in par 10I(b) that the test conditions were not an accurate reflection of the conditions experienced in call centres, based on the evidence, which I have accepted, that input signals of 100mV were not encountered in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">However, I consider par (b) to be a composite plea --- that as a consequence of the test conditions not accurately reflecting call centre conditions, the test conditions were biased to favour M15D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">This reading of par (b) is supported by the companion allegation in par 10H(b) that the report represented that the test conditions were not biased to favour one device over the other, "but instead were an accurate reflection of the conditions normally experienced in call centres".</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Polaris' counsel drew attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the pleadings in this respect, but the matter was not otherwise addressed in submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">Headset profile
 Polaris' claim here is that headset profile 1 used in the comparison test should have been profile 18 as referred to in the Manual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">The Manual contains this information about "Headset Model Configuration" upon which Polaris relied: 
 
 The Headset Model Configuration is used by SoundShield to select a frequency response filter for each supported Headset Model used in SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">These filters are more commonly known as Head Profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">
 

 
 
 NOTE: Each time a new Headset Model is plugged into SoundShield, the equivalent Headset Model Profile must be changed in SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">
 

 
 
 See Appendix 2 of this document for Headset Models and the corresponding Digit LED setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">
 

 
 
 Headset Model profiles will assume values between 0 to 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">This will accommodate a possible 18 different headset models.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">
 

 
Appendix 2 sets out profile model numbers for various headset models.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">The only two numbers presently relevant are 1 for Plantronics H51 headset model and 18 for Telstra's TT4 model H51-TT3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">Polaris says the proper selection of the headset profile was acknowledged by the respondents to be an important issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">Its case is that Dynamic used the H51-TT3 headset in the test using profile 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">According to Polaris' Manual, the correct setting for that headset is profile 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">Profile 1 was to be used with headset H51 and not for H51-TT3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">The former was for use in the general market and the latter for Telstra call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">The evidence of Polaris' own witnesses, Mr Guest and Mr Thompson, does not support this complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">Mr Guest accepted that profile 1 was correct for the general 95dB (non Telstra) setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">He said "We could not deliver profile 18 to the general market because of the special acoustic limiting that Telstra wanted, which is lower than the Australian Standards".</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">The "special acoustic limiting" is of course 90dB as opposed to 95dB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">Mr Thompson agreed that when used in the general mode (95dB) the Plantronics H51-TT3 headset is set to profile 1, and on the 90dB setting, to profile 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">That, he said, was because Telstra requires a greater limiting setting of certain frequencies likely to be encountered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">Mr Fisher maintained his stand that profile 18 was the correct profile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">He was unswayed by Mr Guest's and Mr Thompson's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">He was clearly unhappy with the latter's evidence that if SoundShield was not to be used for Telstra, profile 1 should be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">He did not want to say Mr Thompson was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Instead he said it was not for him to "pass comment on this", and that what Mr Thompson had said was "just poorly expressed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">I do not accept Mr Fisher's evidence on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">Polaris did not carry out any test with the H51-TT3 headset on profiles 1 to 18 so as to show that there was a difference between them for intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">Nor was there any evidence that the profiles were relevantly different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">There was no evidence of differences between the H51 and H51-TT3 headsets showing that they needed different profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">Plantronics, the manufacturer of both headsets, said through Mr Gherbaz that there were no significant differences between them: they were "in effect the same headset with the same speaker, although H51-TT3 has slightly higher production tolerances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">Mr Fisher agreed that the two models were the same except that "the manufacturing tolerances on H51-TT3 are narrower".</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">On the basis of Mr Guest's and Mr Thompson's evidence, I find that in general (non-Telstra) use, the correct profile is profile 1, which was that used by Dynamic in its test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Relating this to the allegations in par 10I of the statement of claim, the position is that: 
(a) 10I(a) --- the comparison test used the correct headset profile 1
 
(b) 10I(b) --- the test was an accurate reflection of conditions experienced in call centres in that the headset profile matched the conditions likely to be encountered in call centres in the general market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">Use of profile 18 would have meant that those conditions would not have been reflected
 
(c) 10I(c) --- SoundShield was appropriately set up for test conditions in that the correct headset profile was used for the chosen headset in a call centre likely to be encountered in the general market
 
(d) 10I(d) --- there was no factor in connection with the headset profile to suggest that the results of the test were not an accurate reflection of the relative performance of the two devices in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">SoundShield's proven record
 The fact that SoundShield had a proven record of acceptable performance in call centres would not, by itself, demonstrate that the test set up representations were misleading for any of the reasons alleged in par 10I of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">It does however lend support to other findings of misleading representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">Commercial arrangement between Dynamic and Plantronics
 Polaris relies on the existence of this relationship, which covered the development and sale of the M15D device, to establish that the test set up representations were misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">It is not pleaded that the arrangement between the respondents was not disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">In my view the mere existence of the arrangement, which Polaris pleads in par 5 of the statement of claim and repeats in its particulars, could not establish that the representations were misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">The comparison report disclosed that: In my view the intended recipients of the report, namely call centre and OH&amp;S managers contemplating the purchase of acoustic protection devices, could not have been misled in any relevant way by the mere fact of the disclosed relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">In and of itself, it does not provide a basis for finding that the test was not properly designed, that SoundShield was not properly set up, that the test conditions were not an accurate reflection of a call centre environment, or that the test results were not an accurate reflection of the relative performance of the two devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">Polaris also claimed, though not in its pleadings, that the report made no sufficient disclosure of the commercial arrangement between Dynamic and Plantronics, in that the report did not disclose the existence of an agreement between them under which Dynamic derived a direct financial interest in sales of the M15D units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">The content of the agreement is confidential and I will record more about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">Given the state of the pleadings, I need not deal with this claim of inadequate disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">July 2005 comparative testing
 This testing was done by Plantronics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">It was conducted in a call centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Polaris claims that it demonstrated that there was "very little difference between the responses for the two units".</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">The result of the tests is described by Mr Shilton of Dynamic in an email to Mr Gherbaz of 8 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">It is in part as follows: 
 
 We've looked at the trial results and run some statistics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Overall there is very little difference between the responses for the two units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">This is a good result, especially considering that the subjects were all acclimatized to the SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">We would have expected that people would be strongly biased towards the familiar product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">
 

 
 
 The responses for transmit show no significant difference and do not indicate any problems for either device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">The responses to the question relating to receive noise levels indicate that Tecate may be better but the difference was not great enough to be statistically significant with only twelve subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">Both units were rated similarly in relation to protection against loud sounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">
 

 
Mr Shilton then told Mr Gherbaz about Dynamic's intelligibility test:
 
 
 Intelligibility testing of the two units under controlled conditions (including controlled volume settings) indicates that Tecate has significantly higher intelligibility in noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">Blind A/B comparisons also indicated that Tecate is perceived to be louder (results attached).</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">
 

 
The comparison report was not distributed until the end of July, some three weeks after the email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">The respondents point out that the nature and circumstances of the July 2005 test were different from those of the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">The July 2005 test was not a test in controlled conditions as was the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">The users tested were accustomed to their existing devices, and call centre operators tended to favour their existing devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">The number of users tested was small (12 users).</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">The test used ratings rather than percentage correct items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">With only 12 users asked a single question about sound quality, only 12 data points are collected compared with 400 in the Dynamic test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">In an uncontrolled environment, context assists with intelligibility because whole sentences are being used, rather than random word lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">The evidence of Mr Gherbaz and Professor Blamey, which I accept, establishes these differences between the circumstances of the July 2005 and the comparison test, and justifies the conclusion that the result of the former does not of itself show that the latter was misleading in any of the respects pleaded in par 10I of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">No check before publication
 The allegation here is that Dynamic's belief that SoundShield was "the headset amplifier currently used for acoustic shock protection in the majority of Australian call centres" together with the results of the July 2005 tests, should have led it to have carried out a further test to check its May 2005 results before publishing the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">It was said that this should have been done because the May 2005 results were "significantly inconsistent" with the "belief" referred to and the July 2005 results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">The "belief" relied on is found in an early draft of the comparison report, though not in the published report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">I accept Plantronics' submission that this complaint is not a particular about the test set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">Rather, it is a contention that Dynamic ought not to have believed the results of its own testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">In any event, Dynamic's failure to do a further test before publication could not lead a reader of the comparison report to be misled in any of the ways pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">Polaris' contention to the contrary is bizarre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">No control condition
 Polaris claims that the comparison test did not include any suitable control condition, in that there was no testing without the use of either device to determine whether there was a proper correlation between the use of the devices and the intelligibility responses of the people tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Professor Newell gave evidence about the significance of a control condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">He said: 
 
 A control condition is a standard against which other conditions can be compared in a scientific experiment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">In drug trials it is typically the condition in which the placebo is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">In this experiment it is the condition that does not involve using the SoundShield device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">It is the reference condition which can be confirmed by others doing similar experiments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">It enables data ... from different experiments to be compared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">If there is a problem in a particular experiment set up or the subjects from a particular experiment are different from another experiment then this will show up in a change in the control condition results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">
 

 
After noting that speech intelligibility test results can be affected by factors other than the conditions a tester wishes to evaluate, and giving examples of this, Professor Newell continued:
 
 
 Having a control condition I can compare my results with previous experiments done under the same conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">In the control condition the results of this experiment are almost identical to an earlier experiment done under the same conditions several months previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">In the control condition the average percentage of words correct in the first experiment was 94% and in this experiment it was 95%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">The average percentage of phonemes correct in both experiments was 98%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">The variability in both experiments was very similar the resulting standard errors were 1% in both cases for words and 0.4% (October experiment) and 0.5% (July experiment) for phonemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">The consistency in the control condition gives a high level of confidence that the experiment is reliably repeatable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">
 

 
The earlier experiment referred to is Mr Fisher's July 2007 test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Dynamic's own protocol for the comparison test did not require a control condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">Professor Blamey claimed that SoundShield was itself the control condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">To this Mr Fisher replied: 
 
 the experiment was designed to compare the attributes of two commercially competing devices that were being tested against each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">The experimenters did not test for baseline performance (eg without any device) and therefore did not know the source of the errors and flaws in their experimental set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">
 

 In cross examination Professor Blamey was taken to a passage in Dynamic's protocol with the Ethics Committee, under the heading "Sound quality experiments", in which it was said that "Experiments will include control conditions without the algorithm applied and experimental conditions with the algorithm applied".</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">It was put to Professor Blamey that he had represented to the Committee that experiments would be conducted without the algorithm being applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">His response was: 
 
 In this particular case, we're comparing the effectiveness of one of our algorithms, which is the ADRO algorithm with a device that does not include the ADRO algorithm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">In this condition, the condition without the algorithm was the SoundShield device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">The condition with the algorithm was the M15 device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">In other experiments that had been done under the same ethics approval, there has been one device which included the algorithm and another device that did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">
 

 
While Professor Blamey's explanation may be consistent with the sentence in the Ethics Committee protocol, I prefer the evidence of Professor Newell and Mr Fisher that a control condition is one which does not involve either of the devices under comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">In my view it is not appropriate to use a device with a different algorithm as a control to test a particular algorithm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">Accordingly, the comparison test was not a properly conducted scientific test, and the representation that it was such a test was misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">Failure to follow test protocol
 It is common ground that Dynamic's test protocol was not followed in the two respects pleaded: there were eight subjects rather than ten, and the results as recorded did not follow the randomisation table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">The representation was that the test was a properly conducted scientific test designed and undertaken with an appropriate level of skill, independence and expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">The mere fact of a departure from the protocol does not in my view establish that the test was not a properly conducted scientific test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">Professor Blamey explained why there were only eight subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">The particular design that was used required equal numbers of lists and subjects in each condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Because there were four conditions, the easiest way to design the test was to use a multiple of four --- either four, eight, twelve and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">More importantly, he rejected the suggestion that testing eight subjects was inadequate to be of high statistical significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">This was because the software package used to do the statistical calculation took into account the number of subjects and the variability of the results, and at the end produced "an estimate of the statistical significance which was highly statistically significant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">Based on that data, Professor Blamey said there was no need for concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">He agreed that eight subjects was a small sample, but said that even small samples can be highly significant if the difference is big enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">If "you're looking for a very small difference, then you need more subjects".</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">That was not the case here; the difference was large enough for the result to be highly statistically significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">Professor Blamey returned to the statistical analysis in re-examination in response to a question as to why the July 2005 test did not cause him to redo the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">He responded that there was no occasion to re-test because the statistical analysis indicated that there was a very low possibility that the results would have been obtained by chance if the two devices were actually performing at the same level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">That analysis gave him confidence that a similar result would be obtained if the test was repeated in exactly the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">He identified the computer program used to analyse the results statistically --- "Minitab" --- which became an exhibit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">He explained that the program is an analysis of variants, which means that it looks at the variability of the different groups of data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">One of the columns, which is labelled "P", is called the "significance level", or the probability that this particular result would have been obtained by chance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">It showed that the probability that the difference between the results would have been obtained by chance was less than one in 1000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">I accept this evidence, and conclude that Polaris has not established that the fact that there were eight rather than ten subjects had the effect that the test was not a properly conducted scientific test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">Whether the departure from the randomisation regime meant that the test was not a properly conducted scientific test is difficult to determine because of the paucity of evidence as to the object of randomisation and the significance of a departure from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">Dynamic's protocol is not of much help.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">Under the heading "Speech Intelligibility: NAL Phonetically Balanced Word Lists", it says that "Noise levels and starting conditions will be randomised".</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">Under the heading "Subjective Assessment", it says " all tests are performed in Random Order to test the systems capability of dealing with rapid change".</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">Later, under the same heading, the protocol says "All noise levels and conditions will be randomly varied and assigned to each participant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">It is not apparent whether the comments under the "Subjective Assessment" heading are relevant to speech intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">The randomisation table itself is uninformative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">It has a "Key" which might be expected to be explanatory of features of the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">These include "MI = Male voice 1" and "F3 = Female Voice 3".</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">However neither appears in the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Doing the best I can on the meagre material available, I have concluded that randomisation was an important part of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">There must have been some significant reason for including it in the protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">The fact that the protocol says that all tests are performed in random order so as to test the systems' capability of dealing with rapid change, suggests that failure to follow randomisation may affect the result of the comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">Mr Fisher drew attention to what he described as three deficiencies in following the protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">One was that there were only eight subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">Professor Blamey gave an elaborate and persuasive response to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">See [181]-[182].</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">The second was that there was an error in the calculation of the results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">This was not pleaded, though Professor Blamey explained that its impact resulted in a fraction of a percent change which could not have had a significant effect on the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">He explained why this was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">The third deficiency was that it appeared that the testing did not follow the randomisation table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">Professor Blamey made no response to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">In his lengthy cross-examination on this topic, he conceded that there had been a failure to follow the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">Unlike his response to the other defects alleged, he did not assert that this failure had no statistical or other significance to the end result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">On the basis of the foregoing matters, I infer that the departure from the table was of sufficient significance to result in the test not being a properly conducted scientific test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">For completeness, I should say that I did not understand Professor Blamey to have contended that the Minitab statistical analysis "cured" any departure from the randomisation table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">Failure to make enquiry of Polaris as to the settings
 This complaint has two related parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">The first is that Dynamic was unfamiliar with the various settings contained within SoundShield when it conducted the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">The second is that it did not enquire of Polaris as to the appropriate settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">In fact Dynamic knew of the existence of the internal settings, but not what to set them to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">By the assertion that Dynamic was unfamiliar with the various settings within SoundShield, I think the pleader meant Dynamic did not know how they should be set.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">Polaris relied on a series of emails between the respondents as evidence that Dynamic did not know the proper settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">Mr Gherbaz and Mr McNeill said that the correspondents were not seeking information for use in the comparison test, but in order to test whether M15D in TT4 mode, using version 6 of the Xenica software, was TT4 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">In order to do this it was necessary to discover the settings actually in use by Telstra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">While Dynamic knew that Telstra's TT4 requirements had been relaxed, it did not know the extent of the relaxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">Polaris disputed that the respondents' email enquiries about the proper settings were directed not to the upcoming comparison test, but exclusively to other tests as to M15D's compliance with TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">If that were true, it said, enquiries would not have been made as to the settings in use at the non-Telstra confidential site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">I do not need to resolve the dispute because, quite apart from the emails, I am satisfied that the respondents did not know all the proper settings before they did the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">In fact they selected the correct headset profile, but the wrong receive gain setting for the 100mV input signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">Professor Blamey agreed that he did not know the correct receive gain setting for that signal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">Mr Gherbaz agreed that he did not know the receive gain setting used by the confidential call centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Mr McNeill agreed that the respondents had no direct knowledge of the settings in April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">Nevertheless Dynamic carried out the test without either asking Polaris for the correct settings or doing another test on different settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">Having regard to its incomplete knowledge of the relevant settings, the test set up representations were misleading because the test was not a properly designed and conducted scientific test, SoundShield was not appropriately set up for the test conditions and the results of the test were not an accurate reflection of the relative performance of the two devices in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">As Mr McNeill said: "If you don't know what the settings are, then you probably shouldn't have done the test in the first place".</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">Subjects tested
 It is common ground that the eight subjects tested were employees of or associated with Dynamic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">Standing alone, this does not establish that the test results were unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Dynamic's Ethics Committee protocol contemplates that its employees may be used as subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">Further, it appears from an article by three of the authors of the comparison report (Ms Wise, Mr Dickson and Professor Blamey) describing the comparative test, that it was a "blind paired comparison" of devices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">That is to say the subjects did not know which device was being used to transmit the test material.</sentence>

<sentence id="s933">Professor Blamey said the same thing in his oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">It was not a double blind test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">The tester knew which device was being tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">No appropriately trained installer
 This complaint is that the SoundShield device was neither installed nor checked by an appropriately trained person familiar with the Manual and the various SoundShield settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">What I have said at [198] is applicable here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">Dynamic did not know all the correct settings and did not have a copy of the Manual that would have filled in the gaps in its knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">In those circumstances, to publish a report was misleading in the respects set out at [198].</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">Unsuitability representations
 Were they made?</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">These representations are set out at [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">The particulars claim they are to be implied and arise from: 
(a) Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the comparison report;
 
(b) the statement in the report that "To achieve an intelligibility score of 90% with the SoundShield, the background noise level of the call centres would have to be reduced to an unrealistic level of about 40dBA"; and
 
(c) the statement in the report that M15D is G616 compliant and suitable for TT4 compliant operation and the absence of a similar statement about SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">SOUNDSHIELD UNSUITABLE FOR USE IN CALL CENTRES
 Would a member of the class of persons likely to read and be influenced by the comparison report understand it as representing that SoundShield was unsuitable for use in call centres because of its poor intelligibility when background noise is present?</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">The class in question consists of managerial staff contemplating the purchase of acoustic shock protection devices for use in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">They are likely to have a familiarity with call centre conditions and the way they operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">They will know the types of phone calls their operators receive, and be aware of the phenomenon of acoustic shock and the means of reducing the risk of that shock by the use of devices such as SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">They are also likely to be aware that SoundShield is commonly used in Australian call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">The report states that the test was carried out using the Phonetically Balanced Monosyllable (PBM) word test with typical call centre background noise levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">The subjects were asked to repeat all the words they heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">A member of the class of readers referred to above would know that call centre operators do not hear random words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">They hear sentences providing context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">Their minds will deal with the problem of a muffled, distorted or missed word by resort to the context in which it appears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">Potential gaps will thus be filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">There was evidence to this effect, and common experience of telephone use and conversation in general supports it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">Call centre operators do not hear "scythe", which might in isolation be heard as "size", followed by "pit" which might be heard as "hit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">They hear a whole sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">On the above basis, the respondents submitted that a member of the relevant class would not carry away from a reading of the report a representation that SoundShield was unsuitable for use in call centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Rather, the reader would take away the actual message of the comparison report, namely that M15D's intelligibility was much better than SoundShield's on the PBM word test administered to the subjects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">Mr Guest did not read the report in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">When explaining his initial concerns about it, he focused on the percentage errors in the word scoring with 55 and 65dBA background noise compared with the 90% at 55dBA background noise required by TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">He said that with a score of that nature, where the error would be one word in five, "we wouldn't be selling any SoundShields".</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">Mr Guest's "one word in five" error rate derives from reading the comparison report as stating that at 55-65dBA operators using SoundShield will mishear 18 to 26% of words spoken to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">That is not what the report says.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">Professor Blamey stated the obvious when he explained that the score on a PBM word test does not reflect the error rate for sentences in a call centre environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">He said that an 80% word score means that users will still be scoring close to 100% on sentences in a typical call centre environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">Mr Guest would seem to have derived his "one in every five words" error rate from Mr Fisher's evidence to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Professor Blamey's evidence, which I accept, disposes of his opinion on the error rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">However this error does not itself mean that the question posed at [202] should be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">Mr McNeill did not read the report as implying that SoundShield was unsuitable for use in typical call centre environments, or that it would be "ineffective" for such use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">While he acknowledged that it stated that SoundShield had performed poorly in the intelligibility comparison, he said the Dynamic PBM word test 
 
 doesn't take into account things like context and, you know, in a call centre there is conversation going on, and so the user is expecting a certain language coming back, and so that helps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">So, you know, people in call centres don't write down word lists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">
 

 
Mr Gherbaz also distinguished between call centre conversation and word tests, saying that in the latter there is no contextual information, and "your brain can't fill in the gaps for random words".</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">Taking into account the characteristics of the class of persons likely to read and be influenced by the comparison report, I am of the view that a member of the relevant class would take away from the report that the authors were stating that SoundShield was unsuitable for use in call centres because of its poor intelligibility when background noise is present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">It is true that the report concerned a PBM word test, and that call centre operators deal with conversation which provides a context that word lists do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Nevertheless, the passage relied on in particular (b) at [201] transposes a word test based result into a call centre environment, and uses that result for the conclusion that for SoundShield to achieve 90% intelligibility, the background noise level of the call centre would have to be reduced to an unrealistic level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">I do not agree with Plantronic's submission that the report's statement that SoundShield is commonly used in Australian call centres is inconsistent with an implication that the device is not suitable for such use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">In its particulars Polaris also relies on Figures 1 and 2 in the report which are set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">
 
 
 The extrapolation in Figure 1 is a pictorial representation of the sentence "to achieve an intelligibility score of 90% with the SoundShield, the background noise level of the call centres would have to be reduced to an unrealistic level of about 40dBA".</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">There was a faint suggestion by Polaris that the dotted line in Figure 1 could be read as representing an actual measurement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">In my view no attentive reader of the relevant class would read the Figure in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">The text describes the dotted line as an extrapolation of the PBM results .</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Mr Fisher and Professor Blamey disagreed as to the significance of the extrapolation in Figure 1, made by the dotted straight line to show a correlation between increasing intelligibility score and reducing background noise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">In his first affidavit Mr Fisher described the extrapolation as "linear", and said it was accepted in the scientific literature that it is incorrect to linearly extrapolate percentage correct scores and noise levels, because this is a non-linear function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">In response, Professor Blamey referred to Figure 6.6 in TT4 which shows intelligibility as a function of noise level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">He said that in its extrapolation Dynamic approximated the relationship as shown in that figure with a straight line over a 10dB range of background noise level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">He said that if Dynamic had used the non-linear function in Figure 6.6, this would have been to the disadvantage of SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">In order to achieve 90% speech intelligibility, the background noise would have had to be reduced even lower than 40dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">Replying, Mr Fisher said resort to Figure 6.6 was "completely inappropriate" because it related to face to face conversation and not to the situation in which there is "monaural presentation of band limited, equalised and amplitude compressed speech".</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">In his third affidavit Mr Fisher explained further why in his first affidavit he said a linear extrapolation was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">He said one needs to consider the extremes of noise levels to realise that a linear relationship is impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">Once the noise becomes inaudible, no further reduction in its level will improve speech intelligibility, and once the noise is so great that it has made the speech inaudible, the speech intelligibility score will fall to zero and no further increase in the noise level will reduce the performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">Professor Blamey's oral response was that Dynamic's extrapolation did not extend above 100 percent or below zero percent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">In cross-examination Polaris' counsel showed Professor Blamey an extrapolation downwards from the 76% correct result to 105dBA and put to him that it was unrealistic to extrapolate on a linear basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">He replied that counsel's extrapolation was certainly unrealistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">This written and oral exchange consumed much time, generated many words, but threw little light on the significance of the linear/non linear controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">I need not attempt to resolve the disagreement between the experts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">As I have said, Figure 1 is a pictorial representation of the words in particular (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">The Figure and the sentence explain each other, and the sentence relied on in particular (b) carries the implication asserted by Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">Although its particulars rely on Figure 2 in the report, I did not understand Polaris to have persisted in that reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">In any event, in view of what I have said about the sentence in particular (b), I need not spend time on Figure 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">SOUNDSHIELD NOT COMPLIANT WITH TELSTRA'S INTELLIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT
 Clause 5.2.2 of TT4 requires speech intelligibility of 90% in call centre environments with conversational chatter to 55dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">The question is whether the comparison report implies that SoundShield does not comply with this requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">Professor Blamey accepted that the 90% sentence in the report was "derived from TT4".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">To that sentence should be added the next: 
 
 ADRO on the other hand, easily achieved 90% intelligibility with call centre background noise at a level of 55dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">
 

 
Professor Blamey agreed that he was not testing to TT4 specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">This is the part of the report in which the informed reader will be most interested --- the result of the comparison test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">That reader, especially one with a Telstra affiliation, would recognise the 90% at 55dBA as Telstra's speech intelligibility requirement, and would take from the assertions that to achieve an intelligibility score of 90% with SoundShield, the background noise would have to be reduced to an unrealistic 40dBA, that M15D easily achieved 90% intelligibility with 55dBA background noise, and that SoundShield did not comply with Telstra's speech intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">The 90% at 55dBA has only one reference point to anyone with knowledge of the specifications applicable in Australia, and that is TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Dynamic was promoting the report as being concerned with TT4 compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">It contained the statement that M15D was suitable for TT4 compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">Dynamic sent a copy of the report to Telstra asserting, wrongly according to Professor Blamey, that the prototype M15D was TT4 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">SOUNDSHIELD NOT G616 COMPLIANT OR SUITABLE FOR TT4 COMPLIANT OPERATION
 For this implication, particular (c) relies upon the statement in the comparison report that M15D is G616 compliant and suitable for TT4 compliant operation, and the absence of a similar statement about SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">If this particular stood alone, I would not take it to imply that SoundShield was not TT4 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">There was much evidence about market awareness of SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">It had, and probably retains, market dominance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">A vast number of sales have been made since 2001 --- at least 60,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">On the other hand, M15D was a new product, unknown to the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">In those circumstances, the report's qualified and knowledgeable audience would not see in a statement about M15D an implicit statement to the opposite effect about SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">However, the particular (c) sentence does not stand alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">In my view it follows from what I have said about the particular (b) sentence and the one following it (see [218]), that the report implies that SoundShield is not suitable for TT4 compliant operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">That is because, while speech intelligibility (90% at 55dBA) is only one TT4 requirement, non-satisfaction with it results in a device's non-compliance, even if all other requirements are satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">The comparison report is concerned only with intelligibility for speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">G616 has no intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">The assertions referred to at [218] give rise to no implication about SoundShield's compliance with G616.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">An informed reader would not see in particular (c) an implication that SoundShield was not G616 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">I refer to what I have said in relation to TT4 at [220].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">Were the unsuitability representations misleading?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">I have found that representations (a) and (b) at [23] were made, and that representation (c), so far as it concerns TT4 compliance, was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">The next question is whether they were misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">Only three of the particulars to par 10G of the statement of claim were pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">The first is that Telstra has purchased SoundShields since 2001 and continues to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">I am satisfied that it would not have done this on a past and continuing basis if the devices were unsuitable for use in call centres because of poor intelligibility where background noise is present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">Indeed it was common ground that SoundShield was capable of operating satisfactorily in call centres on MID with an input of 33-36mV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">The second particular is that since 2001 more than 60,000 SoundShield devices, set up by appropriately trained people utilising the Manual, have been installed in call centres throughout Australia without any reported intelligibility problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">Mr Guest said complaints about poor intelligibility were "very rare".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">When there was a complaint, Polaris checked that the settings were properly programmed for the customer's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">Adjusting and correcting the settings usually resolved the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">Mr Guest's inspection of warranty returns disclosed no case of return as a result of complaints about intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">Mr Minski said customers had intelligibility problems "quite often" during his five years with Polaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">But he was speaking of teething difficulties and not substantive problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">Although the evidence does not establish that there were no reported intelligibility problems over the period during which SoundShield was sold, I am satisfied that apart from teething problems experienced at or shortly after installation, there were very few complaints about intelligibility, and that these were sorted out by Polaris' installers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">That is further evidence (ie in addition to the Telstra custom) that SoundShield is suitable for use in call centres as aforesaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">The third particular is that when set up by an appropriately trained person utilising the Manual, SoundShield achieves speech intelligibility of 90% in call centres with background voice chatter to 55dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">Polaris relies on Mr Fisher's January 2006 and July 2007 tests and Professor Newell's October 2007 test, which it said demonstrated compliance with the 90% intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">In the January 2006 test Mr Fisher did not use the word test specified in TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">He used phonemes instead of words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">Polaris accepted that this was not a complete test of the Telstra intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">Subject to one issue with which I deal at [230], Mr Fisher's 2007 test demonstrated compliance with the 90% intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">This time he used the word lists specified in TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">However Polaris relied primarily on Professor Newell's test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">That used the limiting requirements, word lists and background noise levels specified in TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">The input signal of 48mV was within the range in Table 5.9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">Sixteen test subjects were involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">Professor Newell's test was scored by word correct and incorrect and by phoneme correct and incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">The 90% requirement was met in all conditions however scored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">Subject to the issue referred to at [230], Professor Newell's test shows that SoundShield complies with the Telstra intelligibility requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">The reservation referred to at [228] and [229] relates to Professor Blamey's claim that the input level used in Mr Fisher's test (40mV) and in Professor Newell's test (48mV) did not demonstrate that SoundShield could accept the range of inputs specified in Table 5.9 of TT4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">This table is considered in detail (at [145]-[159]) in connexion with the test set up representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">Professor Blamey's opinion was that the table "suggests that in every setting of the device which is designed to be used with typical telephone in call centres, the device ... should be able to accept 100mV input signal and achieve 90 per cent speech intelligibility with that input signal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">For the purpose of dealing with the unsuitability requirements, I do not need to come to a conclusion about this very controversial table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">That is because I am satisfied that if set up by an appropriately trained person using the Manual, SoundShield would achieve speech intelligibility of 90% in call centres with voice chatter to 55dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">If the installer chose an input in the range 33-48mV, the device would be set to MID.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">If the customer insisted on an input of 100mV, the installer would select the HIGH setting in accordance with the instruction in the Manual that "High will be selected for hosts/consoles with a high output level".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">There was consistent evidence from the Polaris camp that for a 100mV input the HIGH receive gain setting should be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">Accordingly, on the basis: of Telstra's past and continuing custom for SoundShields; that there were very few complaints of intelligibility problems in relation to SoundShield's set up by appropriately trained installers; and that when properly set up in accordance with the Manual the device can accommodate an input of 100mV because it would have been set to HIGH by the installer in accordance with the Manual, 
I find that SoundShield:
 
(a) is suitable for use in call centres and, when set up by an appropriately trained person utilising the Manual, does not have poor intelligibility when background noise is present;
 
(b) complies with the Telstra intelligibility requirement, and
 
(c) is suitable for TT4 compliant operation so far as speech intelligibility is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">In relation to (c), "suitable" is the word used in Polaris' pleadings and in the comparison report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">By that word, I understand Polaris to mean that SoundShield is capable of meeting the intelligibility standard required by TT4, as opposed to being TT4 compliant in the more general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">As appears above, Professor Blamey did not dispute that the device was able to meet the Telstra intelligibility requirement at "lower input levels".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">The case was not concerned with SoundShield's compliance with TT4 in respects other than speech intelligibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">Hence the words "so far as speech intelligibility is concerned" in (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">CONCLUSION 
 I have found that the lowest limiting setting representation was made, and that in the comparison test SoundShield's lowest limiting setting was 95dBA and M15D's was 102dBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">However Polaris has not established that the difference between the two settings made speech heard through the M15D significantly more intelligible than that through SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">Thus it has not established that the testing of the two devices at their lowest limiting settings provided an inappropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">The ethics approval representation was made, but was not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">The test set up representations were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">The representations pleaded in pars 10H(a), (c) and (d) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive by reason of the fact that: the test upon which the comparison report was based did not contain a suitable control condition; in conducting the test, Dynamic did not follow the randomisation table in the test protocol; and Dynamic did not inform itself adequately of the appropriate settings for SoundShield in the test conditions, nor did it enlist the assistance of a person appropriately trained in the installation of SoundShield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">
The representation pleaded at par 10H(b) was not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">The unsuitability representations pleaded in par 10F(a) and (b) of the statement of claim were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">It was also represented that SoundShield was not suitable for TT4 compliant operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">There was no representation that the device was not G616 compliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">The representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">Polaris has thus made out its case under s 52 of the Act in relation to the unsuitability representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">Polaris also pleaded its case in relation to the lowest limiting setting and unsuitability representations in reliance on s 53(a) of the Act, namely that the respondents falsely represented that the two devices were each of a particular comparative standard, quality or grade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">I did not understand it to be in dispute that if the unsuitability representations were found to have been made and were misleading, that would constitute a contravention of s 53(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">In any event, I have concluded that s 53(a) was contravened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">The representations that SoundShield was unsuitable for use in call centres, did not comply with Telstra's intelligibility requirement and was not suitable for TT4 compliant operation, were all false representations that SoundShield was of a particular standard, quality or grade, in that it did not measure up to levels that were required for an acoustic limiting device to be suitable for use in call centres, to comply with Telstra's intelligibility requirement and to be suitable for TT4 compliant operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">Polaris has alleged breaches of s 9 and s 12(a) of the Fair Trading Act 1991 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">What I have said about s 52 and s 53(a) of the Act is applicable to ss 9 and 12(a) as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">Dynamic admits that it published and distributed the report.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1091">I am satisfied that the report was prepared by Dynamic in consultation with Plantronics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">Mr Gherbaz suggested amendments and modifications to the document initially proposed by Dynamic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">Plantronics was not a mere conduit for the carriage of information to those who received the report.</sentence>
