 PROPOSED EVIDENCE IN APPLICANTS' AND CROSS RESPONDENTS' WITNESS STATEMENTS 
 

 Introduction 
 
1 On 10 February 2006 the respondents and cross claimants in these proceedings filed a motion seeking to strike out parts of witness statements filed by the applicants and cross-respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The motion is based upon various objections as to admissibility of the evidence which it is proposed to adduce from the witnesses in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The respondents and cross-claimants have prepared a convenient schedule of their objections, which also summarises the applicants' response to the objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In dealing with the objections I will briefly state my conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">There is a large number of objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Rulings on objections 
 
 3 Statement of Bill Menim 
 
 Par 55 Objection upheld --- inadmissible opinion as to state of mind of persons other than witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Par 68 Objection upheld as to all words after 'Eurest'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Par 70 Objection upheld
 
 Par 71 Objection upheld
 
 4 Statement of John Atmeyok 
 
 Par 22 Objection overruled as to first sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Objection upheld on second sentence after 'I was not happy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Par 23 Objection upheld --- this is a statement about 'the purpose' of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It does not purport to go to reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Par 24 Objection upheld as to all words after 'prepared a report'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Par 25 Objection upheld 
 
 Par 27 Objection upheld
 
 5 Statement of William Boas 
 
 Par 28 Delete 'we', substitute 'I'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">May give evidence of things said which support the conclusionary statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Par 43 Objection upheld --- this is a statement about 'the intention' of an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Par 53 Objection overruled --- compendious reference to statements at meeting but requires elaboration to be given any weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Par 56 Objection overruled but statement requires elaboration to be given any weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Statement of Kuma Aua 
 
 Par 20 Objection overruled --- explanation of his understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Par 33 Objection overruled --- this is explanatory of the witness's views as a director of OTML and secretary for the Department of Mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Par 35 Objection overruled --- statement of existence of documents which has been identified by reference to their content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Par 37 Objection upheld --- as to statement of OTML's approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Statement re future role of business owners is admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Par 38 Objection upheld as to last sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Par 39 Objection upheld --- assumes admissibility of intention of MRSM and is otherwise argumentative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Par 41 Objection upheld --- the position of the OTML Board is not a matter of inference for a witness, it is a matter of evidence either by way of resolution or some other indicator in evidence from which the Court may draw an inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 Statement of Samson Buretam 
 
 Objection is taken to the tender of the entire statement of Mr Buretam as he has died since signing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His evidence may, subject to compliance with the requirements of s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Act), be received under an exception to the hearsay rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I would therefore not uphold the objection to the statement on the basis simply that its maker is deceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The question whether the evidence should otherwise be excluded pursuant to the discretion conferred on the Court by s 135 of the Act is left open at this stage as it has not been the subject of any submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I also leave open for further submissions the weight which should be given to any part of this statement which is not corroborated by other evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Subject to those general observations I rule on objections taken to specific paragraphs in the statement as follows: 

Par 35 This is admissible as going to the state of mind of Mr Buretam.</sentence>

<sentence id="s148">That is not appropriate.</sentence>

<sentence id="s150">An order to that effect will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The question of the costs of the motion will be reserved.</sentence>
