<sentence id="s0">
 In the substantive proceedings before the Court the applicant alleges that the respondent has contravened s 16(1) of the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act 1991 (Cth) ("the Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The respondent admits the contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It is common ground that, if the Court takes a similar view, the Court may make a declaration to that effect and impose a pecuniary penalty on the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The quantum of such penalty is the remaining issue in contention between the parties in the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It is also common ground that, as a result of the events comprising the respondent's contravention of the Act, Mr Mark McCallum died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Three of Mr McCallum's relatives wish to table material by way of written statement, explaining the impact of the loss of Mr McCallum on their lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The parties have come to an agreement regarding the Court's reception of such material, subject to the exercise of the Court's discretion (TS 12 October 2009 p 2 ll 25-33 and p 3 ll 19-21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However prior to reaching such agreement the respondent had opposed this course of action on the following bases which are relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion: In these proceedings there is merit in permitting the immediate family members of Mr McCallum to table written material detailing the impact of the loss of Mr McCallum on their lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Court has discretion, as a superior court of record, to regulate its own affairs in a way which permits the Court to hear and assess such information as the Court determines to be of assistance to the Court in resolving the matters before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I consider that in the context of these particular proceedings this material would be of some assistance in understanding the background to these proceedings: cf North J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">However I consider that the principles raised by the respondent in relation to the tabling of this material have force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In permitting this material to be admitted: In my view the appropriate orders are as follows: The Court will receive material from Mr Paul Everett, Mrs Ann Everett and Mr Andrew McCallum, being immediate family members of Mr Mark McCallum, which material will be confined to the impact of the demise of Mr Mark McCallum on their lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The material referred to in paragraph 1 of these orders will be in the form of written statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
