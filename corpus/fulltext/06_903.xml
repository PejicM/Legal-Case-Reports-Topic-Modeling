 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Timber Creek, a small township in the north-western corner of the Northern Territory, lies on the Victoria Highway, a major road route across Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It is located approximately half way between Katherine and Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples, represented in these proceedings by Alan Griffiths and William Gulwin, have lodged an application for a native title determination in respect of certain land and waters located within the town boundaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The application is opposed by the Northern Territory of Australia, and by the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory ("AFANT").</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 For the purposes of this judgment, the town of Timber Creek must be distinguished from the creek which flows within the town, after which the town is named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">All references hereafter to Timber Creek will be to the town, while references to "the Creek" will be to the waterway that runs through it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 Timber Creek lies along the south bank of the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Creek is a tributary of that river, and joins it near the head of the tidal reach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">A map of the general area surrounding Timber Creek is appended to these reasons for judgment as Schedule A1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A closer view of that area is appended as Schedule A2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Much of the terrain surrounding Timber Creek is spectacular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Escarpments and gorges are carved into sediments from the many rivers and creeks in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The landscape has been shaped by volcanic activity and erosion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 The Victoria River area is generally described as a "mecca" for fishing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It has some of the best and biggest barramundi to be found in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Barramundi can be caught all year round, though the best time is said to be between late March and late May, coinciding with the end of the monsoon season.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">There are also a number of other tourist attractions in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">These include river cruises, wildlife parks, scenic flights, lookouts and walks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 This case concerns a claim for a determination of native title relating to a very small area, the entirety of which falls within the boundaries of what is by now an established town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It raises for consideration a number of the issues that frequently arise in native title cases, but also the operation of s 47B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the NT Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That section has recently been the subject of judicial consideration, but its limits have yet to be fully explored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It has the potential to overcome the effect of any acts that might otherwise have extinguished native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THIS COURT 
 
7 These are in fact three separate, but related, applications for determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Each application is brought pursuant to s 61(1) of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">8 The first application, D6016 of 1999 ( Alan Griffiths on behalf of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples v Northern Territory ) was filed on 10 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The area claimed was Lot 47 Timber Creek, being described as an area proposed for compulsory acquisition by notice dated 3 September 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The application was brought as a defensive measure, in anticipation of an act by the Northern Territory government that might otherwise have defeated any claim to that land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">9 The second application, D6008 of 2000 ( Alan Griffiths and William Gulwin on behalf of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples v Northern Territory ) was filed on 11 May 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The area claimed comprised Lots 97-100, 109 and 114 Timber Creek, being described as areas proposed for compulsory acquisition by notices dated 2 February 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This application too was brought as a defensive measure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 The third, and most comprehensive application, D6012 of 2000 ( Alan Griffiths and William Gulwin on behalf of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples v Northern Territory and Anor ) was filed on 18 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The area claimed was described as other claimable land within the town boundaries of the town of Timber Creek, specified to be Lots 1-9, 22, 33, 35, 37, 49, 56-57, 65-74, 80, 87, 101-108, 110-113, the waterway of Timber Creek including its beds and banks, and Special Purposes Lease 00494 (Lot 16), owned by the Conservation Land Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 As initially formulated, the third application included a claim to that part of the Victoria River, and its bed and banks, which lay within the town boundaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, shortly before this trial began, the claimants were granted leave to exclude the Victoria River from the ambit of their claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">12 Although the three native title determination applications presently before the Court have never, at any stage, been consolidated, they were, with the consent of the parties, heard together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">By agreement, the evidence in each application was treated as evidence in the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">13 Initially, the Commonwealth was joined as a respondent to each application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">However, in August 2003 it withdrew from D6016 of 1999 and D6008 of 2000 once it was satisfied that it had no interest in the land claimed in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In January 2005, the Commonwealth withdrew from D6012 of 2000 after the claimants made it clear that they no longer proposed to pursue a claim to the Victoria River, or its bed and banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">14 AFANT is a body that represents the interests of amateur fishermen in the Northern Territory in pursuing their recreational and sporting activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It was joined as the third respondent to proceeding D6012 of 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">With the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from that proceeding there is no longer any designated second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">For convenience, AFANT is still named as the third respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">THE CLAIMANTS' CASE AS FINALLY PLEADED 
 
15 The Further Amended Application, as filed on 18 March 2005 may be treated as a "template" for all three applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">As previously indicated, it is brought in the names of two senior representatives of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples, Alan Griffiths and William Gulwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">16 The Further Amended Application was amended pursuant to leave granted well into the course of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Nothing of any consequence turns upon these amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In substance, what occurred was simply that the description of the apical ancestors of the "native title claim group" was altered in order to reflect the evidence that had been given in the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">17 Section 61(2)(a) of the NT Act provides that an application for a native title determination may be made by a person or persons authorised to make that application by a "native title claim group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Section 61(2)(c) provides that the person, or persons who are so authorised are jointly designated, in the singular, as "the applicant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">18 In the present case neither Mr Griffiths' nor Mr Gulwin's authority to make this application as the persons authorised by the native title claim group to do so is disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">19 Invoking s 223(1) of the NT Act , the claimants say that, according to the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples have, by those laws and customs, a connection with the claim area that gives rise to native title rights and interests recognised by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">They say that the connection of the claimants with the claim area arises through spiritual, religious, physical and historical associations, through biological, classificatory or adoptive descent through the four grandparental lines, and through processes of succession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They say that the claimants have communal rather than individual rights and interests in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">20 The native title claim group is described in the Further Amended Application as comprised by the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples who are descended from six apical Ngaliwurru persons identified as: 
 
 
 &#8226; Punitjkula (whose children include Takawuk and Jarapil, and whose grandchildren include Violet Paliti);
 &#8226; Mangarmawuk, or Mungaramawuk (whose brother was Lamparangana, and who was Alan Griffiths' and Pat Jatjat's maternal grandfather);
 &#8226; Tiyawatulwan (whose children include Little Wally Wanampura, and whose grandchildren include Darby Tiyawatulwan);
 &#8226; Tiyawakatak (whose children include Mutpurula, whose grandchildren include Jo Lewis Nyapat, and whose great grandchildren include Josie Jones Tatpung, Stephen Jones Yawunula, and his sister Lorraine Jones Purrungurungali);
 &#8226; Pulawatitj (whose children include Walamawuk and Tinker Kananji/Lalamak, and whose grandchildren include Larry Johns Mungkawali); and
 &#8226; Puijayinkari (whose grandchildren include Dinah Maylinti, and whose great grandchildren include Darby Tiyawatulwan).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

21 The claim area is described as land located in the town of Timber Creek, within the Timber Creek town boundary in the Northern Territory (Northern Territory Government Gazette No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">24, 20 June 1975).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A map of Timber Creek showing each Lot claimed is appended to these reasons for judgment as Schedule B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The claim area is said to include:
 
 
 &#8226; vacant Crown land and waters, Lot numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 22, 33, 35, 37, 49, 56, 57, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 80, 87, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113;
 &#8226; the creek named Timber Creek (including its bed and banks) as delineated on a map attached to the Further Amended Application; and
 &#8226; Special Purposes Lease 00494, granted to the Conservation Land Corporation for the purpose of carrying out its functions in accordance with the Conservation Commission Act 1980 (NT) (subsequently renamed the Parks and Wildlife Commission Act 1980 (NT)) consisting of Lot 16 of the Town of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 

 22 The Further Amended Application makes clear that any area in relation to which a "previous exclusive possession act" under s 23B of the NT Act has been done is excluded from the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">That is said to be subject only to "Schedule U of this application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">However, for reasons that are not immediately apparent, no such schedule is in fact appended to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">23 The Further Amended Application states that title searches have been made in relation to Lots 6, 33 and 49, and that there were no titles issued in relation to any of those Lots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">24 Under the heading "Description of Native Title Rights and Interests", the claimants assert that the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples are entitled, under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, to exercise native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area which include the following:
 
 
 "(a) to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the area claimed to the exclusion of all others; 
 (b) to speak for and to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the application area; 
 (c) to reside upon and otherwise to have access to and within the application area; 
 (d) to control the access of others to the application area; 
 (e) to use and enjoy the resources of the application area; 
 (f) to control the use and enjoyment of others of the resources of the application area; 
 (g) to share, exchange and/or trade resources derived and from the application area; 
 (h) to maintain and protect places of importance under traditional laws, customs and practices in the application area; 
 (i) to maintain, protect, prevent the misuse of and transmit to others their cultural knowledge, customs and practices associated with the application area; 
 (j) to determine and regulate membership of, and recruitment to, a landholding group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" 
 


 
25 The pleading then outlines the factual basis upon which the claimants assert their native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It alleges that the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples were, and are, traditionally, the owners of the land and waters that are the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It asserts that the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples have exercised the native title rights and interests described in the preceding paragraph "from time immemorial".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It says that they, and their ancestors, have, by their traditional laws acknowledged, and their traditional customs observed, maintained a connection with the claim area from well before the date on which the Crown acquired sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In relation to the Northern Territory, the year of sovereignty was 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">26 The pleading states that the claim area is merely part of a much larger area of land and waters owned and occupied by the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples since before the acquisition of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It states that a number of important sites both within and surrounding the claim area have been recorded and/or registered under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 (NT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It says that the claimants' traditional connection with the land, going back to the time of their ancestors, is demonstrated by archaeological findings that establish long standing habitation of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It asserts that some of this evidence goes back to a time well before the first Europeans came into contact with local indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">27 The pleading then sets out detailed particulars of the traditional laws and customs that the claimants say the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples have long observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">These include a common kinship system, observance of common laws relating to land tenure, and traditional usage of land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In addition, it provides particulars of activities currently undertaken by the claimants within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Apart from occupying the land, they are said to hunt and collect animals, fish and other food, to share, trade and exchange resources, to conduct ceremonies, to restrict the access of outsiders, and to care for the land and waters in accordance with spiritual and social obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">They are also said to bury the dead on the land, to maintain traditional knowledge of the land and waters, and to pass that knowledge on to younger generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">28 It is important to note, as the pleading recognises, that Timber Creek, and much of the surrounding countryside was, at one time, subject to pastoral leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The terms upon which those leases were granted varied somewhat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Some might be regarded as "exclusive" while others would perhaps be characterised as "non-exclusive", in the sense in which those expressions are used in the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">29 Irrespective of whether the pastoral leases were exclusive or non-exclusive, they would normally have extinguished any native title rights and interests that might otherwise be held by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">However, the claimants contend, in their pleading, that s 47B of the NT Act applies to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">If that is so, any extinguishment of their native title rights and interests that might otherwise result from the creation of any prior interest through pastoral leases is required, by that section, to be "disregarded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">30 In this judgment, by reason of s 47B , questions of extinguishment will be addressed against a different statutory background than might otherwise be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">HISTORY OF THE CLAIM AREA 
 
31 A large folder of what the claimants termed "History Documents" was tendered before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">There are over one hundred such documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">A number of them are quite lengthy, and copiously footnoted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">32 It may be useful, at this stage, to provide a brief overview of the type of material contained within this folder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">33 For example, Document 1, " Hidden Histories ", written in 1991, contains what its author, Professor Deborah Bird Rose ("Professor Rose"), Professor of Prehistory and Anthropology at the Australian National University, describes as "Black Stories from Victoria River Downs, Humbert River and Wave Hill Stations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">34 Document 2 is described as a "Log Book of Bradshaw's Run".</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It contains a number of extracts from hand written notes regarding the activities of Mr Fred Bradshaw, a pastoralist, contemporaneously made in 1894.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">35 Document 4, " Dingo Makes Us Human --- Life and Land in an Aboriginal Australian Culture ", by Professor Rose, contains endnotes from her valuable account of the life of aboriginal people in the Victoria River area prior to, and after, initial contact with Europeans in the latter part of the nineteenth century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">36 Document 7 is of particular significance to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It consists of extracts from the field notes of a renowned anthropologist, Professor W E H Stanner ("Professor Stanner"), written in 1935, after had undertaken an expedition to the country around Victoria River Downs in 1934.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Professor Stanner is, even today, regarded as one of the leading figures in indigenous anthropology, and his work features heavily in the anthropological reports prepared by the experts who gave evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">37 Also featured in the folder of History Documents were a number of papers on different subjects written by Darrell Lewis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Lewis is a graduate in pre-history from the Australian National University, having graduated with honours in archaeology in 1983.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He then enrolled in a Masters degree in archaeology at the same university, and completed a thesis on the rock art of the Victoria River district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He prepared as report based upon field and archival research into the history of that region which he had carried out over a 27 year period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He is married to Professor Rose, and assisted her in the preparation of her book " Hidden Histories ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He has, since the early 1970s, carried out research into the ethnography and rock art of the Victoria River district, and has written extensively on the history of the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">38 Of particular importance, given the issues in this case, are the earliest extant records of European explorers, namely those of Augustus Gregory dating back to his expedition in 1855.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">There are a total of twenty-one separate extracts from Gregory's notes, and they shed considerable light upon conditions in the area at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">His discussion of his contacts with the "blacks" around Stokes Range near the eastern banks of the Victoria River is particularly illuminating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">39 There are many other primary sources, old and new, contained in the folder of History Documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I have read them all, and had regard to them in preparing these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I do not think that it is necessary to refer to them in any detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The historical record is not, of itself, a focal point of dispute between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Broadly speaking, the history of the area is uncontentious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">40 European knowledge of the Victoria River district was gained gradually, over a period of time, from the earliest explorations until settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The first European contact occurred in the early 1500s, when Portuguese seafarers compiled what was known as "the Dieppe map" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In 1644, Abel Tasman sailed the northern coastline, but left no records of significance so far as these proceedings are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In 1819, Phillip King was sent on a mission to explore the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">However, he failed in that endeavour, and there is nothing to be gleaned from any records of that mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">41 In 1839, Captain John Wickham and Lieutenant John Stokes explored the lower Victoria River, in the course of their survey of the northern Australian coast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">However, they did not remain in the area for long, and left no records that are of any great utility to this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">However, there is recorded, in Stokes' notes, an account of a native village located one mile southwest of the Victoria River containing "thirteen huts of paper bark".</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In addition, Stokes recorded a party of aborigines crossing the river, heading downstream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">He said that there was a "large local population".</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He saw other signs of indigenous occupation, including the remains of a fire, and burnt off areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">42 Captain Wickham's reports led to the expedition of Augustus Gregory in 1855, to which I have already referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">During that expedition, a depot camp was established on the southern bank of the Victoria River, just below where Timber Creek is now located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The expedition paved the way for the arrival of the pastoralists that was to follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">43 Gregory's expedition is interesting in other ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He sailed from Queensland to the Northern Territory, and along the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He was shipwrecked in the area now known as Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Legend has it that Timber Creek was given that name because Gregory had to cut down a large amount of timber in order to make repairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The site of Gregory's camp can still be visited, and some of his carvings can be seen on one of the Boab trees in Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Over an eight month period he explored much of the region, and helped to open it up to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He left a detailed published account of his expedition in his journal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It described indigenous people as having frequently visited his camp, and on one occasion as having displayed hostility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Shots were fired, and one man was slightly wounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In addition, there are diaries and letters of expedition members who record contact with indigenous people at the camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">44 The major result of Gregory's exploration was to make known the tremendous extent of prime grazing land in the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Lewis comments that one of the ensuring mysteries of European settlement is that this "pastoralists' bonanza" remained untouched for almost 30 years thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">That is not to say that there was no significant European contact before the arrival of the pastoralists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In 1865, Captain Hutchinson, on behalf of the South Australian Government, explored the northern coast in search of a suitable location for a settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In 1867, Captain Francis Cadell visited the Victoria River area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">However, neither he, nor Captain Hutchinson, saw any advantage in attempting permanent settlement in this region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Indeed, Captain Cadell was scathing in his description of the region, stating:
 
 "owing to the numerous dangers of that rapid and shoal-encumbered river, also taking into consideration the 100-mile belt of the most wretched, rocky, barren and waterless country, a perfect Tierra del Fuego, that if the Elysian fields had been beyond it I should have felt it to have been a duty to report against its selection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">" 
 

45 In 1879, Alexander Forrest led the last significant exploration before the arrival of the first European settlers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Forrest came overland from the Kimberley region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">By the time he and his men reached the Victoria River district they were starving, and many were ill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">They had little or no contact with the local indigenous inhabitants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">They left no records that are of any great assistance in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">46 It was at about the time of Forrest's expedition that the first pastoral leases in this area were granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">However, the actual stocking of any of the various holdings did not commence until several years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The first permanent European settlement occurred with the establishment of several cattle stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">These included Delamere in 1881; Wave Hill and Victoria River Downs ("VRD") in 1883; Ord River in 1884; Auvergne in 1886; Newry in 1888; Bradshaw in 1894 and Inverway in either 1894 or 1895.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">47 After the arrival of the first permanent European settlers, Timber Creek became an important port.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It served that purpose until some time in the 1930s when the construction of roads in the region made the port redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">48 In 1890 a local store was opened at a place known as Gregory's Depot, upstream from Victoria River Depot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">This was the closest source of supply to the surrounding cattle stations, and provided a stopover point for travellers to replenish their supplies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">49 Indigenous inhabitants of the area soon found themselves being excluded from their traditional lands by various cattle station owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Initially, cattle grazed on only a relatively small portion of the total leasehold areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">However, as herds grew and pastoralists become more familiar with the country, the area under their control widened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">This increased pressure upon local indigenous groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Within a few years, those aboriginal persons who had not been killed, in a hopeless conflict with white settlers, were forced out of their traditional lands, and into the bush.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">50 During these early years of settlement, relations between the local indigenous groups and the European settlers ranged from open warfare, and massacres, to what was at times friendly cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However, the unstable relations between the indigenous groups and the pastoralists soon made it obvious that there was a need to maintain law and order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">In 1897 the Timber Creek police station was first built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It remains in place today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">51 In the early 1900s, some station managers began to encourage aboriginal people to settle at the various homesteads and outstations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">A number made the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">However, while the open conflict may have ended, cattle spearing and theft from station stores and unoccupied camps continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">This situation quickly degenerated into a kind of guerrilla warfare, with aborigines striking opportunistically and then retreating into rough range country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">52 For the first decade or so after settlement ("post-contact") there was little, if any, peaceful interchange between pastoralists and aborigines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Most station work was done by whites, or by indigenous persons brought in from distant regions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Eventually things began to change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The general level of hostility decreased, and was replaced by conflict of a more sporadic nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Peaceful contact became more regular, and by 1905 most stations had established aboriginal camps at homesteads and outstations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Gradually local aborigines mastered the various skills required for cattle work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">53 During the period when aboriginal people were "coming in", they were employed variously as station hands, domestics, or as labourers whose job it was to transfer stores from ships that came along the Victoria River to shallow-draught vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">They were also employed as teamsters, responsible for taking supplies to the various stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">54 It must be remembered that throughout this period, all aboriginal people were under the control of a Chief Protector of Aborigines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">See generally, The Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">This resulted in laws such as the right to remove 'half caste' children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It also meant that indigenous persons were subjected to restricted travel and forced labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">They had no right to vote, and no right to receive an education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Although these laws provided that the Chief Protector (and under him, the police), were responsible for the welfare of aborigines, in practice it was usually the station manager or other white station employees who exercised day to day control over their lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">55 The police were also responsible for issuing rations to those indigenous persons who regularly camped near the police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">While the records regarding this practice were not always well kept, it is believed that it continued until approximately 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">56 As indigenous people became increasingly involved in station work, the station economies became gradually more dependent on their labour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The period from roughly 1920 to 1960 saw little change in their conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The stations operated on the open range system of cattle grazing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">During the dry season cattle were mustered for ear marking, branding, and other tasks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">At the beginning of the wet season the stock camps closed down and most station employees were laid off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Aboriginal workers usually returned their clothes to the station store, were provided with basic provisions, and returned to the bush, walking across country to visit relatives and engage in traditional ceremonies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">57 Mr Lewis, who appears to have put together the folder of History Documents, and who produced the "History Report" upon which much of this summary is based, also wrote a short introductory history of the region in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It is entitled " A Shared History --- Aborigines and White Australians in the Victoria River District Northern Territory ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">He comments, in relation to the indigenous inhabitants of the area:
 
 "They inherited the intimate knowledge of country developed over untold generations and added to it through their own experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">" 
 

58 By the 1930s, the vast majority of indigenous persons living in the Victoria River district resided in station camps, and worked alongside white men and women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Some refused ever to "come in", living out their lives in the rough back country of the stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Others spent time in station camps, or in station employment and then returned to the bush, moving freely between the two modes of life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">59 Many of the stations in the Victoria River district were large and, for much of their history, owned by overseas operators, such as Vesteys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">These overseas based owners were, for years, reluctant to invest in fencing, or other improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Without fencing, it was difficult to control cattle, or to improve bloodstock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Consequently, cattle on the stations were more like wild animals than domestic beasts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Stock work resembled hunting rather more than husbandry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">60 World War II impacted only slightly on the Victoria River district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Although the town of Katherine was bombed by the Japanese, no homesteads in the vicinity of the Victoria River were attacked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Nonetheless, there was a small military presence at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Trenches were dug, and the local police hid important records and stores, in case of invasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">61 One effect of the war was that many white station employees and drovers enlisted in the armed forces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">This left a shortage of stockmen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Indigenous persons began to play a greater role in the cattle station economy, and some were put in charge of stock camps for the first time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Victoria River district aborigines became aware that improved work conditions were possible, and aspired to a greater degree of equality than had hitherto been the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">However, when the war ended, station life for aborigines reverted, more or less, to what it had been in earlier times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">62 In 1966, local dissatisfaction on the part of indigenous persons finally came to a head at Wave Hill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Aboriginal employees walked off the job, and camped in the Victoria River bed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Initially they demanded full wages and improved conditions before returning to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">However, these demands were soon overtaken by others, including in particular a demand for land rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">By 1972, aborigines from other stations had joined the strike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">63 This action caused turmoil in the regional station economy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Ultimately, indigenous persons gained independence from the stations, and began to receive full wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The stations themselves reorganised their economies, spending more on fencing and other infrastructure, and relying increasingly on technological advances rather than on large numbers of low paid stockmen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Consequently, far fewer aborigines came to be employed than had previously been the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">64 Until the 1970s, all land in the Victoria River district had been held under some form of European title, generally pastoral leases or, annual pastoral permits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In addition, some of the land was Crown land, in the form of town commons, stock routes and stock reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">In 1973, the Commonwealth Government acquired Kildurk Station, which was later renamed Amanbidji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">It subsequently turned over that land to the indigenous community as aboriginal freehold land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">65 The Wave Hill strikes also contributed to the enactment of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Land Rights Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">This resulted in some indigenous groups gaining grants of land in the northern Victoria River region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">For example, Fitzroy Station, Innesvale Station, the Stokes Range north of Jasper Gorge, and Jasper Gorge itself, Mistake Creek, part of Wave Hill, and the Hooker Creek Aboriginal Reserve all came under aboriginal control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Gaining title to this land enabled the local community to avail itself of infrastructure which included housing, electricity and schools.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">66 Mr Lewis, upon whose work I have based a good deal of this brief historical account, comments that the strikes of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the rise a of land rights movement, led to resentment by white cattlemen towards aborigines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In some instances, indigenous persons found that they were no longer able to live on the stations, and that they were forced to move to the nearest town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Alternatively, they moved to aboriginal living areas such as Daguragu and Yarralin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Ultimately a generation of young indigenous persons grew up with little or no experience of station work, few prospects of meaningful employment, and the attendant social and economic problems that this entailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">67 According to Mr Lewis, conditions began to improve after the mid-1980s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Old resentments began to die away, and the number of indigenous persons working on the stations steadily increased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In addition, education standards began to improve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">By 1997, indigenous health workers, teaching aides, and police aides were being employed in the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Indeed, in that year, four of the eight Timber Creek Town Councillors were indigenous persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">That made Timber Creek the only town in Australia that was governed by a council with an equal number of indigenous and non-indigenous representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">68 In 1983, a primary school was established at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Initially only indigenous children attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Local non-indigenous children undertook their studies through other means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The first non-indigenous child was enrolled in 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">By 1997 virtually all local non-indigenous children attended the school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">In addition, an Aboriginal Community Police Officer was assigned to the local police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">69 Mr Lewis concludes that the historical record clearly shows that aborigines have been associated with the Timber Creek area from the time of the first European explorers and during the entire period of European settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">He says that there is no reason to believe that the aborigines encountered by the explorers and early settlers were not the ancestors of the aboriginal people living in the area today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">He notes that indigenous people strongly identify with particular tracts of country, and that Stanner recorded a long standing connection between the Nungali and Ngaliwurru peoples with Timber Creek as far back as 1934.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">He says that the association of these people with Timber Creek has been maintained throughout in spite of early violent contact with Europeans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">He also comments that since the successful land claim over Timber Creek in 1985, strong communities have developed in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">He adds that despite over 100 years of European settlement, traditional languages are still spoken, ceremonies performed and traditional foods and medicines harvested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">People know where the travelling and localised Dreamings are active, and have taken steps to map and register sacred sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Traditional trade links still operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">As well, people remember and recount their history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Young men's initiation ceremonies are performed regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">In his view, there is much about the manner in which the local community goes about its daily life that reflects long standing traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">THE ABORIGINAL LAND COMMISSIONERS 
 
70 The claimants base their case in large measure upon findings made by various Aboriginal Land Commissioners who exercised powers under the Land Rights Act , between 1985 and 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Those findings relate to land that immediately surrounds Timber Creek, but not the town itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">That is so because the Land Rights Act does not encompass claims to land situated within towns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The findings are said to be of particular importance not merely because of the proximity of the areas concerned, but also because they relate basically to the same indigenous groups as are claimants in the proceedings before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">71 The claimants acknowledge that any findings made by the Aboriginal Land Commissioners must be qualified having regard to the fact that they were made under the Land Rights Act , a statutory regime that differs significantly from that of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Under the Land Rights Act the primary issue is whether a particular claimant, or claimants, can demonstrate "traditional Aboriginal ownership", as that expression is defined in s 3(1) of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">That section provides, in substance, that unless the contrary intention appears "traditional Aboriginal owners" in relation to land means a "local descent group" of aboriginals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">That group must have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land that places the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for that site, and for the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The group must be entitled by aboriginal tradition to forage as a right over the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">72 The key term, "traditional Aboriginal owners" is not a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It is rather a creature of statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The meaning of the term is influenced to some extent by the definition in s 3(1) of "Aboriginal tradition" which is:
 
 "the body of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs of Aboriginals or of a community or group of Aboriginals, and includes those traditions, observances, customs and beliefs as applied in relation to particular persons, sites, areas of land, things or relationships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">" 
 

73 There is one key distinction between the Land Rights Act and the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Under the Land Rights Act , claimants are not required to establish either continuity or historical links with the land .</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Indeed, it has been held that by reason of the definition of "Aboriginal tradition" in s 3(1) , the Land Rights Act deals not so much with "traditions", in the sense of immutable customs handed down from ancestors, but rather with the observances, customs and beliefs actually practised by a particular community at the time of the relevant inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">74 The position under the NT Act stands in sharp contrast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The claimants must show that they are a society united in and by their acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs; that the present day body of accepted laws and customs is, in essence, the same body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by their ancestors (adapted to modern circumstances); and that the acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs has continued substantially uninterrupted by each generation since sovereignty in 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">75 There are four determinations under the Land Rights Act that are of particular significance so far as the claimants are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Those findings were all generally favourable to the indigenous groups that instituted the land claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Section 86 of the NT Act renders them admissible in these proceedings as "the transcript of evidence in any other proceedings before ... any other person or body": Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 per Mansfield J (at [431]-[432]) (" Risk ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The four determinations are as follows, in chronological order:
 
 &#8226; Timber Creek Land Claim Report No 21 (19 April 1985) --- Commissioner Maurice
 &#8226; Kidman Springs/Jasper Gorge Land Claim Report No 30 (31 March 1989) --- Justice Olney
 &#8226; Stokes Range Land Claim Report No 36 (28 June 1990) --- Justice Olney 
 &#8226; Ngaliwurru/Nungali (Fitzroy Pastoral Lease) Land Claim No 137 and Victoria River (Bed and Banks) Land Claim No 140 Report No 47 (22 December 1993) --- Justice Gray 
 The Timber Creek Land Claim Report No 21 (19 April 1985) 
 
76 This land claim arose out of an application by the Northern Land Council in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Its original intention was to claim only the Timber Creek Commonage Reserve ("the Reserve").</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">However, before the inquiry commenced the application was twice amended so as to include all those parts of the bed and banks of the Victoria River between the eastern and western boundaries of the Reserve which did not form part of the town of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">At a later stage of the inquiry, the claimants withdrew so much of the claim as related to the bed of the river, and its northern bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">However, they maintained the claim to the southern bank, immediately adjoining the Reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">77 There were 163 claimants in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">They were presented as one group, comprising six sub-groups, each of which was associated with a separate tract of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">During the course of the proceeding, the senior members of the sub-group identified the country with which that sub-group was associated by referring to a focal site, and by associating that tract of land with a named male person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">78 Commissioner Maurice noted that it appeared from the genealogies and evidence associating past generations with one tract or another that the predominant, if not exclusive, principle for recruitment to the sub-group was patrilineal descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The only exception was that of a single sub-group, designated sub-group A, whose patriline had died out in comparatively recent times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">79 An anthropologist with considerable experience in land claims, Dr Ian Keen, described the claimants in that land claim as a "cognatic kin group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Commissioner Maurice accepted that description as apt, but considered it unnecessary to rely upon any such concept to arrive at the conclusion that the claimants now formed a "local descent group" within the meaning of the Land Rights Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The Commissioner said (at [34]):
 
 "It is enough for me to say that up until the generations constituted by the children and grandchildren of the senior generations of claimants, there was operating a principle of patrilineal descent to which all persons born up to then appeal to legitimise their membership of the total group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The two senior members of sub-group A can, and to my mind do, rely in part upon succession to the country of their deceased mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">All those in the succeeding generations can point to descent through the patriline or the matriline or both, and that, I am satisfied, is the principle of descent which has been operating for two or three generations among this group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">" 
 

80 Sub-group A was the key sub-group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The tract of land with which it was traditionally associated included the western three-quarters of the claim area, and the whole of the land comprised within the boundaries of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">When the claimants referred to that tract of land, they invariably described it as "Lamparangana's country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Its focal site was described as "Makalamayi", in the north-east corner of the town area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The Commissioner described this as an important site, associated with the Snake, Stingray, Shark and Barramundi Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">81 The evidence before the Commissioner was that Lamparangana had died about 30 or 40 years prior to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">That meant that he probably died some time in the late 1940s or the early 1950s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">This was within the living memory of at least the more senior claimants, many of whom appeared to have known him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The genealogies prepared for the purpose of the hearing showed some four generations below Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">He was said to have had only one child, a son, who had been killed whilst still young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">He was also said to have had a brother, Mangaramawuk who had a daughter, Clara.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">She in turn had two children, Alan Griffiths and Pat Jatjat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">They were both claimants in the Timber Creek Land Claim as were their children and grandchildren.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">82 Alan Griffiths was the only member of sub-group A to give evidence in the course of the Timber Creek Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He said that he was born and raised on his father's country, at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">As a young boy, he had regularly visited Timber Creek with his parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">By the 1980s, he and his family lived in Kununurra, and had done so for some years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">However, he maintained that it was his custom to visit Timber Creek annually, with his sons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">83 Mr Griffiths' claim was based substantially on his direct genealogical links to Mangaramawuk, his maternal grandfather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The other claimants clearly regarded him as one of the traditional owners of Lamparangana's country and, so it appeared to Commissioner Maurice, to the rest of the claim area as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">84 The Commissioner observed (at [38]):
 
 "As the hearing progressed it became evident that Allan (sic) has played and continues to play a major role in ceremony and ritual, not only at Timber Creek but also at places like Kununurra, Port Keats, Daly River, Pulumpa and Peppimentari.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">" 
 

85 Commissioner Maurice then referred to Mr Griffiths' sister, Pat Jatjat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">He noted that she lived at Yarralin, an Aboriginal community located on VRD, about 150 kilometres by road from Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">She was married to a patrilineal descendant of sub-group D, which had its focal site at Wantawul.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Although she had spent a good part of her life on VRD, she was well known to most of the other adult claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Indeed, she had lived at Timber Creek until about a year or so before the Timber Creek Land Claim Report was completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Her husband had been employed as a tracker by the Timber Creek police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">86 The Commissioner observed (at [40]):
 
 "What did emerge clearly from the evidence was that senior members of other sub-groups had a detailed knowledge of and demonstrated strong spiritual affiliations with the sites and dreamings on Lamparangana's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">" 
 

87 The Commissioner also identified the members of sub-group B, its focal site being Wunjayi, linked to Little Wally, the "now deceased father of Darby Tiyawatulwan".</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">He said that there was a strong affinity between Little Wally and Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Before he died Lamparangana was reputed to have asked Little Wally to take over his, Lamparangana's, country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Darby also gave evidence before the Commissioner, and was regarded as an impressive witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The Commissioner found Darby to be a man who strongly identified with the claim area, and its still rich mythology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Apart from Darby and his children, the only other member of sub-group B was his deceased sister's son, Georgie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">88 The Commissioner then turned to sub-group C. Its focal site was Yanturi, on the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Two members of that sub-group gave evidence, saying that they took Yanturi country from their father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">One of them, Jo Kulpitala, when tested as to his knowledge of places on his "Yakpali" (father country) was able to demonstrate an extensive knowledge of the sites and Dreamings in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The Commissioner concluded that the members of this sub-group had strong spiritual affiliations to the various sites and the surrounding country, and that they played a leading role in the ritual and ceremonial life of the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">89 Sub-group D had as its focal site Wantawul, which was east of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">There was evidence that Wantawul was associated with the Caterpillar Dreaming, itself a manifestation of the rainbow snake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Evidence was given by Paddy Bullita, the senior spokesman for the sub-group, who said that his country was Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">He said that members of his generation traced their membership of the sub-group through the patriline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">He said that he took country from Lamparangana, who had taught him the Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">The other main witness was Darby's mother, Dinah Maylinti, Little Wally's wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">She said that she took country through both her father and mother and, in relation to Timber Creek, through Little Wally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">90 Sub-group E had as its focal site Maiyalaniwung, well to the south of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">It had as its main speakers two sisters, Violet and Nida.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Violet described Maiyalaniwung as her father country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Their father, Takawuk, eventually came to live at Timber Creek where Nida was born.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The sisters said they came into contact with members of the other sub-groups, including Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">It was he who had taught Violet about his country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Violet said that all the claimants looked after Lamparangana's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">In her case that was because she had grown up there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">91 The last of the sub-groups was sub-group F. The father country for this sub-group was Kuwang, better known as Stokes Range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">It lay well to the east and south of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Three patrilineal members of that sub-group spoke during the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">They were Big Mick, Little Mick and Bardi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">They were all the sons of Big Wally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The Commissioner described Big Mick's knowledge of the sites and mythology, not only of the claim area but of the entire region, as "unsurpassed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">92 The Commissioner visited many sites in the claim area that were said to be of historical significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">He noted that there were marked concentrations of sites in the valleys associated with the Victoria River, Timber Creek and, to a lesser extent, Line Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">He concluded that the narratives conveyed by the senior claimants showed that they believed that various mythological creatures of the Dreamtime had passed through various locations, and left something of their essence behind in the places they had visited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">They also believed that the spirits of these Dreamings still inhabited the land, and that they were most powerful at those places where they had stopped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">93 The claimants were questioned about their personal Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">These were described as kuning and ngulu, the former being inherited patrilineally, and the latter inherited matrilineally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Ultimately, the Commissioner considered the evidence regarding these matters to be somewhat obscure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">He did not find it necessary to come to any firm conclusions regarding this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Importantly, he observed (at [97]):
 
 "I am unable to discern any structural differentiation between one sub-group or another with respect to affiliation for sites on the claim area, be it Lamparangana's, Little Wally's or Takawuk's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">The same seems to apply to the distant country centred on Yanturi, but no clear picture emerged for that centred on Wantawul or Kuwang".</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">
 

94 The Commissioner noted that, over and over again, the senior claimants described the responsibility of the whole group for the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">He said that he could not find any smaller collection of the claimants who might rightly be identified as having responsibilities of a higher order than the rest of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">He explained (at [101]-[103]):
 
 "To understand how I arrived at this conclusion, I think it is helpful to state my impression of how the senior claimants perceive and conceptualise the events of the recent past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Firstly, they do identify particular tracts of land with six identifiable patriclans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Secondly, because of the influences and constraints placed upon them over the past 100 years or so by European settlement, Lamparangana's country must have developed outstanding economic and religious significance for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Thirdly, at least in that period, secondary rights in and responsibility for country traditionally derived from mother or her male relatives, for co-residence, from marriage and possibly from other sources must have had great significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Dr Keen's categorisation of the six sub-groups as together constituting a cognatic kin group serves to emphasise the underlying familial ties that justified the oft made assertion that all the family --- meaning all the six sub-groups --- were looking after the country now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Fourthly, people asserted a right to Lamparangana's country in common with other claimants, not by asserting their membership of a group, but by calling upon blood or affinal connections with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Fifthly, Lamparangana was the last of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">From what I can gather of the nature of the man, he too must have been very concerned about who would look after the country when he was gone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Sixthly, Little Wally and Takawuk were short on patrilineal descendants to ensure the survival and continuity of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Seventh, eminent men like the fathers of Jo and Duncan, the two Micks, and Paddy Bullita had been dispossessed in the sense that their father country had been taken over by the pastoralists and was now no longer as accessible to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">
 
 What I think has happened is that during, if not before, Lamparangana's time, there was begun a gradual blurring of the distinction between the responsibilities of those who were patrilineally associated with the claim area and those who were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">For their culture to survive it was necessary to accord equal status to the larger cognative kin group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">I strongly suspect that the catalyst for this was the need to recognise a successor to Lamparangana's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
 
 Whatever the precise dynamics, we now have a group made up of the patrilineal and matrilineal descendants of six old-world patriclans who together constitute the local descent group and as such have undifferentiated, and hence primary, spiritual responsibility for the claim area.</sentence>

 Kidman Springs/Jasper Gorge Land Claim Report No 30 (31 March 1989) 
 
95 This claim under the Land Rights Act related to a parcel of land comprising an area of approximately 370 square kilometres (later expanded to include some areas not initially claimed) near VRD bounded by the Auvergne stock route, and the former pastoral lease known as Delamere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Alan Griffiths was among the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">96 Justice Olney indicated in his report that he had avoided the temptation to enter upon a critical analysis of the anthropological evidence presented to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">He said that to have done so would have produced a layman's opinion of issues about which the professionals were unable to reach unanimity, and thus tend to clothe with authority valueless and irrelevant conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">He focussed instead upon the evidence of the claimants themselves, observing in the course of doing so (at para 5.14) that:
 
 "Experience in this and other land claims has demonstrated that the process of proving the necessary affiliation of claimants to a site on the land is generally assisted by the ability of the claimants to take the Commissioner to the site and to speak about their spiritual responsibilities towards it and surrounding land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">" 
 
 

97 The Commissioner noted that he had been denied access by the owner of VRD to that property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">He observed that this had materially prejudiced the presentation of the claimants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">98 In summarising the claim, Justice Olney said that it had been particularised in a report prepared jointly by Professor Rose and Mr Lewis, (to whose various works I have previously referred).</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">He cited, in particular, those parts of the report that had been prepared by Mr Lewis which provided an historical perspective of the area in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">99 Justice Olney then set out the evidence concerning the claimants' relationship to the land which was the subject of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">He noted that the claimants (and other indigenous persons in this region) perceived the geographical landscape as a living entity with which they were in daily and life-long interaction and communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">They accepted willingly the obligation to care for the land, and believed that their relationships with country involved mutual rights and responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">At the same time, they believed that this relationship was reciprocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Country had an obligation to care for its people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The claimants said, for instance, that in their own country they would not go hungry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">They also said that their country would not harm them provided they took proper care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">They saw themselves as caretakers of a relationship of trust deriving from the Dreaming and passed on to them by their immediate forbears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">100 After setting out several fundamental aspects of the "Dreaming", as the claimants used that term, Justice Olney distinguished between the patrilineally inherited relationship, or kuning, and the wider "Dreaming" frequently used by the claimants which encompassed matrilineal identities as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">He summarised the local descent groups that together made up the claimant group, noting that within a number of those local descent groups, the senior men had demonstrated an extensive knowledge of the country, and a willingness themselves to take responsibility for mythology, ritual, ceremonial life, and the protection of the sacred sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">101 Justice Olney concluded that the claimants had established that they were the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land, and that the strength of their attachment to that land and their common spiritual affiliations to various sites had been cogently demonstrated in a number of different ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Stokes Range Land Claim Report No 36 (28 June 1990) 
 
102 This was a claim in relation to land that was formerly part of Fitzroy Station (Pastoral Lease 674).</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The claim was brought in 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">It was determined by Justice Olney, as Aboriginal Land Commissioner, on 28 June 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">103 The claim area included most of Stokes Range, known by the claimants as Kuwang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The claimants' language identity was described as Ngaliwurru, although the land under claim did not constitute the full extent of Ngaliwurru country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">According to Justice Olney, the Ngaliwurru people had maintained extensive ties with neighbouring language groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Their country was said to be adjacent to that of the Nungali to the north, and to the Jaminjung to the north-west.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">104 After outlining the history of the area, Justice Olney stated that the Ngaliwurru distinguished four types of kin at the grandparent level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">These were:
 
 &#8226; father's father (FF) or kakung; &#8226; mother's father (MF) or jawajing; &#8226; mother's mother (MM) or jayiyn (jaju); and &#8226; father's mother (FM) or ngapupu (ngapuju).</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">

105 These kin terms were often used by the claimants in describing their affiliations to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Certain kin were classified together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">For example, a person's mother's sister was classed as "mother" (rather than aunt), and a father's brother as "father" (rather than uncle).</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">All claimants were related through marriage and descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">106 Justice Olney analysed in some detail the matrilineal and patrilineal affiliations in the area, known as ngulu and kuning respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">He noted that there were three claimant groups, Kuwang, Wanimiyn-Yiritjpinti and Maiyalaniwung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">The members of these groups all had common spiritual affiliations to, and responsibility for, sites of significance on three corresponding countries within the land claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Each group also had secondary responsibilities for, and affiliations to, the whole of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The three countries in the claim area were not, however, strictly bounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">107 Recruitment to the claimant groups was via descent through any of the four types of kin at the grandparent level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Intermarriage between groups meant that claimants were often members of more than one group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Children who were members of groups at the lower levels of genealogy were frequently spoken of as "coming in" as claimants through their mother or father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Recruitment by adoption was also valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">108 Justice Olney observed that the term "Yakpali mululu" was frequently used to describe members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It applied to individuals with seniority, and could also be used to include all group members affiliated to specific areas of country in a primary spiritual way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">109 Justice Olney concluded that the claimants had a responsibility to care for and protect sites in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">They were expected to perform ritual to keep the country strong, and to seek knowledge about country and how to impart that knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">All members of the local descent group had the right to speak for country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">This involved discussing the Dreamings, talking about the history of the country and calling the names of places within the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Only those with the proper relationship to country could speak for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">All members of the local descent groups had the right to forage over their respective countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">What distinguished some of them as "Yakpali mululu" was their right to deny others access to certain foraging areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Foraging also involved the collection of materials required to make goods such as boomerangs, hardwood shields, and ochres which formed part of the "Winan" or trade, which moved goods along clearly authorised paths through the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The Commissioner went on to observe that only claimants had the right to water the heads of strangers, ensuring their proper introduction to the country, and to its ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">110 Ultimately, Justice Olney concluded that there was overwhelming evidence to support a finding in favour of the three groups of claimants who were said to be the traditional Aboriginal owners of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">He said that these three groups could, for practical purposes, be regarded as a single coherent group having common affiliations and common aspirations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The claimants had demonstrated a strong attachment to the land, and ought to be recognised, under the Land Rights Act , as traditional owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Ngaliwurru/Nungali (Fitzroy Pastoral Lease) Land Claim No 137 and Victoria River (Bed and Banks) Land Claim No 140 Report No 47 (22 December 1993) 
 
111 These two land claims were filed separately, but heard together, by Justice Gray who was, at that time, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">112 The land the subject of claim No 137 was Northern Territory Portion 785.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Its northern boundary was the Victoria River, on the opposite side of which was Northern Territory Portion 3686 (Bradshaw Station), the subject of a pastoral lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">In the north-west, the subject land was bounded by Northern Territory Portion 3122 which was vested in the Myatt Aboriginal Land Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">To the west and south-west were two Portions known as Gregory National Park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">113 The land the subject of claim No 140 was the bank of the Victoria River adjacent to the land the subject of claim No 137, together with the bed of the river to the mid line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">114 Justice Gray carefully noted the requirement under s 3(1) of the Land Rights Act that that in order to meet the definition of a "traditional Aboriginal owner", the claimants had to establish the existence of "a local descent group of Aboriginals ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">He referred to what Mr Justice Toohey had said regarding the meaning of that expression, when his Honour was Aboriginal Land Commissioner:
 
 "In essence my view was and is that a local descent group is a collection of people related by some principle of descent, possessing ties to land who may be recruited ... on a principle of descent deemed relevant by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">That description is apt to include the instances of patrilineal descent, patrifiliation and matrifiliation among the Kungarakany claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">" 
 

115 Justice Gray noted that this passage had been cited with approval by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Northern Land Council v Aboriginal Land Commissioner (1992) 105 ALR 539 (at 553).</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">The Full Court observed (at 553-4):
 
 "In the present case ... the views expressed by the Commissioners in their later reports coincide with the ordinary meaning of the expression "local descent group" and correctly state the law, subject to two matters which call for comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The first is, as was indeed recognised in a number of reports, although the underlying principle of recruitment to a group must be some form of descent, that need not be seen in a biological sense, and persons not claiming biological affiliation may be adopted into and become part of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Thus the principle of descent should be interpreted not solely in a biological sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Secondly, the words "deemed to be relevant by the claimants" may be misinterpreted by some.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">What has to be found is the existence of a group, recruited by descent, possessing ties to the land and otherwise satisfying the criteria set out in the definition of "traditional Aboriginal owners".</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">The particular principle of descent in operation will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">It may be that, in a particular area, the Aboriginal people of that area have adopted the principle of matrilineal descent; in another area, there may have been adopted some other principle of descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The point is that the principle of descent will be one that is recognised as applying in respect of the particular group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Further, there is no reason the particular principle of descent traditionally operating may not change over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">That is what Toohey J meant when his Honour used the words: "... a principle of descent deemed relevant by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">" 
 
 It should not be thought that the words are to be taken to suggest that the governing descent principle in operation in a particular group could be changed by them at whim so as to fit the circumstances of a land claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">
 

116 Justice Gray then dealt with the notion of "descent criteria".</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">He said:
 
 "3.2.1 In the present claim, the evidence is strong that the claimants recognise a dual principle of descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">A person is recognised as taking country from both his or her father's father ('kakung country') and his or her mother's father ('jawajing country').</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Responsibility and rights for kakung country and jawajing country are generally considered to be of equal importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Sometimes, there are assertions of rights and responsibilities to father's mother's country ('ngapuju country') and mother's mother's country ('jaju country').</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">This is particularly so when strict adherence to rights to kakung and jawajing country alone would give rise to a risk of a descent group becoming extinct, or so vestigial as to leave too few people to exercise proper responsibility for country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">It is also the case when the actual attachment of people to ngapuju or jaju country is so strong as to result in the acceptance of those people as part of the group with traditional responsibilities for, and rights to, that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">
 
 3.2.2 In considering the claim, I have been prepared to accept as members of a local descent group people who claim through their fathers' fathers and people who claim through their mothers' fathers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">In some circumstances, I have regarded it as appropriate to recognise as members of a local descent group those who claim through their fathers' mothers and those who claim through their mothers' mothers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">There are cases, however, in which the evidence does not support the proposition that these wider claims should be upheld, usually because the circumstances in which they would be recognised by the claimants generally as having sufficient strength are not present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">It is plain that the recognition of the rights of people to the country of all four grandparents as a matter of course would result in the disappearance within a relatively short time of any notion of separate groups with responsibility for different areas of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The way in which the claim was put indicates that the claimants have not been so generous in affording recognition of traditional rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">" 
 

117 Justice Gray observed that the claim before him was put primarily on the basis that there were seven separate but overlapping local descent groups, each with its own attachments to, and responsibilities for, a part of the land claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">After identifying these groups (some of which coincide broadly with the various claimant groups in the proceeding before me, including Makalamayi, Wunjayi, Yanturi and Wantawul), he found that although there were seven identifiable areas of land, each associated with a descent group, the reality was that responsibilities were viewed as shared on a much less strict basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">There was considerable overlapping of the areas of land associated with the different groups, and a sharing of Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">118 In relation to the group described as Makalamayi, Justice Gray observed that there were no living patrilineal descendants of those whose country was claimed by members of that group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">He found that Lamparangana had been a highly respected and active custodian of the country to which that group laid claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Indeed, it was often referred to by the claimants as "Lamparangana's country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">119 Justice Gray found that Lamparangana had no living descendents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">His brother, Mangaramawuk, was survived by two grandchildren, Alan Griffiths and Pat Jatjat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">He concluded that both were entitled to membership of the Makalamayi group through their jawaji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">He said that he was conscious of the strength of the connection which other descent groups had to Lamparangana's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">120 Justice Gray described Makalamayi country as being based heavily on the town of Timber Creek, and the land held by the Myatt Land Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Its major Dreaming was the Wirip, or Dingo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">He found that the evidence established clearly that the members of each of the seven descent groups identified earlier in his report had spiritual affiliations to sites both on and near portions of the land claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Those affiliations were common to the members of each group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">In many cases, they were also held in common with members of other groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">121 Justice Gray found that members of the groups ranked equally in their obligations and rights, whether they had acquired membership through their fathers, or through their mothers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">He found that the claimants possessed a high degree of knowledge of the sites on the land claimed, and the Dreamings relating to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">That knowledge was at its strongest among the more senior claimants, but it was clear that they regarded it as important to pass on the knowledge to younger members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">122 Justice Gray also found that the claimants demonstrated continued commitment to ceremony and ritual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">A number of the senior claimants had maintained strong connections with the land the subject of the claim during their working lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Some of the claimants desired to live on the land that was the subject of claim No 137.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">However, whether they lived in the claim area or not, a substantial number visited it on a regular basis, and camped there whenever they were able to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Justice Gray assessed the claimants' attachment to the land as "very strong indeed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">123 In his overall summary of the claim, Justice Gray considered it important to note at [1.11] that counsel for the Northern Territory, in his closing remarks at the hearing, had volunteered that both he, and those instructing him, could not have failed to be impressed with the evidence which had been adduced from the claimants regarding their ownership of the land under claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">THE KEY REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING NATIVE TITLE 
 
124 Before I summarise the evidence led on behalf of each of the parties to these proceedings, it may be useful to set out in general terms the legislative framework within which this case must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">125 Section 223 of the NT Act is the critical provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The section defines both native title, and native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">It relevantly provides:
 
 " Common law rights and interests 
 
 
 
 (1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: 
 
 
 (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and 
 (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and 
 (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">
 
 
 Hunting, gathering and fishing covered 
 
 
 
 (2) Without limiting subsection (1), rights and interests in that subsection includes hunting, gathering or fishing, rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">" 
 
 

126 The other major section that needs to be considered at this point is s 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">It states the requirements for the determination of a claim:
 
 "A determination of native title is a determination whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area (the determination area ) of land or waters and, if it does exist, a determination of: 
 
 
 (a) who the persons, or each group of persons, holding the common or group rights comprising the native title are; and 
 (b) the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (c) the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the determination area; and 
 (d) the relationship between the rights and interests in paragraphs (b) and (c) (taking into account the effect of this Act); and 
 (e) to the extent that the land or waters in the determination area are not covered by a non-exclusive agricultural lease or a non-exclusive pastoral lease - whether the native title rights and interests confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of that land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">" 
 
 

127 There are now a number of authorities that bear upon the construction of these, and other key provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">I shall consider their effect upon the issues raised in these proceedings later in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">It is useful, however, at this stage, to refer to several leading cases that must be understood in order to appreciate the significance of the evidence, both lay and expert, that was presented before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">128 In Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 (" Ward HC") the High Court dealt with a claim for a determination of native title in relation to an area of approximately 7900 km 2 within the East Kimberley region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">The claim area included land and waters in the north of Western Australia and some adjacent land in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">The application included a claim to the right to maintain, protect and prevent the misuse of cultural knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Some of the land within the claim area was subject to existing pastoral leases, but most was previously the subject of pastoral leases which had been abandoned, forfeited for non-payment of rent or non-compliance with lease conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">129 The High Court made it plain that where claims are made under the NT Act for rights defined in that Act, the determination of native title rights and interests was to be governed solely by the Act, and not by loose analogy with concepts developed from the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">130 On the question of extinguishment, the High Court held that the NT Act provided for the partial extinguishment or suspension of native title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Native title rights and interests could usefully be seen as a "bundle of rights", the individual components of which might be extinguished separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">The use of that metaphor had the advantage of drawing attention to the fact that there may be more than one right or interest, and also that there may be more than one type of right or interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Not all rights and interests were capable of full or accurate expression as rights to control what others may do on or with the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Questions of extinguishment first required the identification of the native title rights and interests alleged to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Whether rights defined in the NT Act have been extinguished by a grant of rights to third parties or an assertion of rights by the executive government required a comparison to be made between the legal nature and incidents of the right granted or asserted and the native title right asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">131 Relevantly for present purposes, the High Court held that s 225 of the NT Act , which provided that a determination of native title should include "the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the claim area" required "the public right to fish" recognised by the common law to be recorded as an "other interest" within s 225(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">In that case any exclusive right under traditional law and custom to fish in tidal waters had been extinguished because such a right was inconsistent with public rights of navigation over and fishing in those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">132 The High Court said at [89] that the expression "possession, occupation, use and enjoyment ... to the exclusion of all others" in s 225(e) of the NT Act was "a composite expression directed to describing a particular measure of control over access to land".</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">It went on to observe that to break the expression into its constituent elements was apt to mislead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">In particular, to speak of "possession" of the land, as distinct from possession "to the exclusion of all others" would invite attention to the common law content of the concept of possession, and whatever notions of control over access might be thought to be attached to that concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Instead, the relevant task was described as being:
 
 "to identify how rights and interests possessed under traditional law and custom can properly find expression in common law terms".</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">
 

133 Even without recourse to Ward HC, it seems obvious that the relevant starting point, when considering a claim for determination of native title, is to focus upon the "rights and interests" that are said to exist in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">As the High Court noted in Ward HC at [52], the "rights and interests" so described are those that find their origin in law and custom that predates sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">In other words, they owe their origin to a normative system that is separate and distinct from the legal system of the power acquiring sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">That normative system is constituted by the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the indigenous peoples concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Such rights and interests do not necessarily correspond with rights and interests familiar to lawyers today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">It will generally be preferable to express those rights and interests by reference to the activities that may be conducted, as of right, on or in relation to the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">134 It is of course necessary to ensure that a determination of native title complies with the requirements of s 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">In particular, s 225(b) provides that it must state the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">135 In Ward HC, the High Court held that where in relation to some parts of the claim area, native title rights and interests that were found to exist did not amount to a right (as against the whole world), to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of land or waters, it would seldom be appropriate, or sufficient, to express the nature and extent of the relevant native title rights and interests by using those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">That of course is a matter that must be borne in mind in the event that a finding of native title is made in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">136 In Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2002) 214 CLR 442 (" Yorta Yorta" ), the High Court made it plain at [33] that all elements of the definition of native title in s 223(1) must be given effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">137 In Ward HC, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in relation to s 223(1) (at [17]):
 
 "Several points should be made here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">First, the rights and interests may be communal, group or individual rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Secondly, the rights and interests consist "in relation to land or waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Thirdly, the rights and interests must have three characteristics: (a) they are rights and interests which are "possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed", by the relevant peoples; (b) by those traditional laws and customs, the peoples "have a connection with" the land or waters in question; and (c) the rights and interests must be "recognised by the common law of Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">" 
 
 
 
 

Their Honours continued in relation to s 223(1)(a) (at [18]): 

 
 "The question in a given case whether (a) is satisfied presents a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">It requires not only the identification of the laws and customs said to be traditional laws and customs, but, no less importantly, the identification of the rights and interests in relation to land or waters which are possessed under those laws or customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">These inquiries may well depend upon the same evidence as is used to establish connection of the relevant peoples with the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">This is because the connection that is required by par (b) of s 223(1) is a connection with the land or waters "by those laws and customs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Nevertheless, it is important to notice that there are two inquiries required by the statutory definition: in the one case for the rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs and, in the other, for connection with land or waters by those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">" 
 

138 Finally, their Honours said in relation to s 223(1)(b) , (at [64]):
 
 "In its terms, s 223(1)(b) is not directed to how Aboriginal peoples use or occupy land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Section 223(1)(b) requires consideration of whether, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, they have a "connection"' with the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">That is, it requires first an identification of the content of traditional laws and customs and, secondly, the characterisation of the effect of those laws and customs as constituting a "connection" of the peoples with the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">No doubt there may be cases where the way in which land or waters are used will reveal something about the kind of connection that exists under traditional law or custom between Aboriginal peoples and the land or waters concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">But the absence of evidence of some recent use of the land or waters does not, of itself, require the conclusion that there can be no relevant connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Whether there is a relevant connection depends, in the first instance, upon the content of traditional law and custom and, in the second, upon what is meant by "connection" by those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">This latter question was not the subject of submissions in the present matters, the relevant contention being advanced in the absolute terms we have identified and without examination of the particular aspects of the relationship found below to have been sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">We, therefore, need express no view, in these matters, on what is the nature of the "connection" that must be shown to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">In particular, we need express no view on when a 'spiritual connection' with the land (an expression often used in the Western Australian submissions and apparently intended as meaning any form of asserted connection without evidence of continuing use or physical presence) will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">" 
 

139 In Yorta Yorta Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ identified the requirements of s 223(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Their Honours focused, in particular upon the need for evidence of "connection".</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">They said (at [37]):
 
 "First, it follows from Mabo [No 2] that the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty over the several parts of Australia cannot be challenged in an Australian municipal court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Secondly, upon acquisition of sovereignty over a particular part of Australia, the Crown acquired a radical title to the land in that part, but native title to that land survived the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty and radical title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">What survived were rights and interests in relation to land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Those rights and interests owed their origin to a normative system other than the legal system of the new sovereign power; they owed their origin to the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous peoples concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">" 
 

140 Their Honours went on to state, at [38]-[40], and again at [43]-[45], that the rights and interests that are the subject of the NT Act are those that derive from traditional laws and customs forming a body of norms that existed before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">They said in relation to the meaning of "traditional" (at [46]-[47]):
 
 "That being so, the references, in pars (a) and (b) of the definition of native title, to "traditional" law or custom must be understood in the light of the considerations that have been mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">As the claimants submitted, "traditional" is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society, usually by word of mouth and common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">But in the context of the Native Title Act , "traditional" carries with it two other elements in its meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">First, it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions: the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">It is only those normative rules that are "traditional" laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">
 
 Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and customs) is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">" 
 

141 In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 , (" Daniel "), RD Nicholson J summarised the principles that underlie ss 223 and 225 of the NT Act (at [137]-[141]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">His Honour noted, inter alia, that the reference to "communal, group or individual rights and interests" required attention to be focussed upon whether there existed a "society" out of which a body of laws and customs could be said to be acknowledged and observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">The reference to "traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed" was intended to be understood as meaning rules having normative content and not just observable patterns of behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">A traditional law or custom was one that would have passed from generation to generation of a society, usually by word of mouth and common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The normative system under which the rights and interests were possessed had to be a system that had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Demonstrating the content of traditional law and custom might well present difficult problems of proof, and much might turn on the evidence led.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">However, the demonstration of some change to, or adaptation of, traditional law or custom, or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests between sovereignty and the present, would not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">142 RD Nicholson J went on to say, with respect to the reference to "connection", this might well depend upon the same evidence as was used to establish rights and interests in relation to land or waters which were possessed under traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">However, the NT Act required two separate inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">A right or interest possessed under traditional laws and customs, but unrelated to land or waters could not assist a claimant for native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">In some cases, the way in which the land or waters were used would reveal something about the kind of connection that existed under traditional law or custom between indigenous persons and the land or waters concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">It was wrong to see indigenous connection with land as reflected only in concepts of control of access to that land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">143 Finally, his Honour noted that the reference in s 223(1)(c)(2) "recognised by the common law of Australia" was to be understood as serving two purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">The first was a requirement for refusal of recognition to rights or interests which, in some way, were antithetical to fundamental tenets of the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">The second was to emphasise the fact that there was an intersection between legal systems, and that the intersection occurred at the time of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">Thus, the native title rights and interests that were the subject of the NT Act were those which existed at sovereignty, survived that fundamental change in legal regime, and now, by resort to the processes of the new legal order, could be enforced and protected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">144 In Risk , Mansfield J observed that the High Court's decision in Yorta Yorta imposed a requirement of continuity on both the aboriginal society, and on the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs that are claimed to give rise to the rights and interests under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">His Honour stated (at [56]):
 
 "Laws and customs do not exist in a vacuum --- they 'arise out of and, in important respects, go to define a particular society': Yorta Yorta at [49], [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">In this context, 'society' is to be 'understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of laws and customs': at [49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">If the society ceases to exist, then so too do its traditional laws and customs, from which rights and interests arise: at [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Once a society has ceased to exist, it is not possible for descendants of that society to take up again the 'traditional' laws and customs as those expressions are used in the NT Act : [51]-[52].</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">As the majority said in Yorta Yorta at [53]: 
 
 
 
 'When the society whose laws or customs existed at sovereignty ceases to exist, the rights and interests in land to which these laws and customs gave rise, cease to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">If the content of the former laws and customs is later adopted by some new society, those laws and customs will then owe their new life to that other, later, society and they are the laws acknowledged by, and customs observed by, that later society , they are not laws and customs which can now properly now be described as being the existing laws and customs of the earlier society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">The rights and interests in land to which the re-adopted laws and customs give rise are rights and interests which are not rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom but in the laws and customs of the new society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">'" 
 


 
145 His Honour went on to make clear that the requirement for continuity of connection is not absolute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">He cited the following passage from the judgment of the majority in Yorta Yorta (at [83]):
 
 "...demonstrating some change to, or adaptation of, traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests in the period between the Crown asserting sovereignty and the present will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The key question is whether the law and custom can still be seen to be traditional law and traditional custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Is the change or adaptation of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples when that expression is understood in the sense earlier identified?</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">" 
 

146 His Honour went on to say that the acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs must have continued "substantially uninterrupted" since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">He concluded that, in the case of the Larrakia people, in the Darwin area, a combination of circumstances had, in various ways, interrupted or disturbed their continued observance of, and enjoyment of, the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people that existed at sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Accordingly, the current Larrakia society, with its laws and customs, had not carried forward the traditional laws and customs of the Larrakia people so as to support the conclusion that those traditional laws and customs have had a continued existence and vitality since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">SECTION 47B 
 
147 As previously indicated, a key provision in these proceedings is s 47B of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">That section relevantly provides:
 
 " When section applies 
 
 (1) This section applies if: 
 
 
 (a) a claimant application is made in relation to an area; and 
 
 (b) when the application is made, the area is not: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) covered by a freehold estate or a lease; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) covered by a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority, made or conferred by the Crown in any capacity, or by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area is to be used for public purposes or for a particular purpose; or 
 (iii) subject to a resumption process (see paragraph (5)(b)); and 
 
 
 
 
 (c) when the application is made, one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">
 
 
 
 
 Prior extinguishment to be disregarded 
 
 
 
 (2) For all purposes under this Act in relation to this application, any extinguishment, of the native title rights and interests in relation to the area that are claimed in the application, by the creation of any prior interest in relation to the area must be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">
 
 
 
 Effect of determination 
 
 
 
 (3) If the determination on the application is that the native title claim group hold the native title rights and interests claimed: 
 
 (a) the determination does not affect: 
 
 
 
 (i) the validity of the creation of any prior interest in relation to the area; or 
 (ii) any interest of the Crown in any capacity, or of any statutory authority, in any public works on the land or waters concerned; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the non-extinguishment principle applies to the creation of any prior interest in relation to the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">" 
 
 
 

148 Section 47B was recently considered by a Full Court of this Court in Northern Territory v Alyawarr (2005) 145 FCR 135 (" Alyawarr ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">That case, which adopted a construction of the section that was favourable to the claimants, was the subject of an application by the Northern Territory for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">On 19 May 2006, special leave was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">149 Because s 47B negates the effect of prior acts of extinguishment if the section is applicable, it is of fundamental importance in a case involving past pastoral leases, such as the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">I shall return to the interpretation to be accorded to the section later in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">THE CLAIMANTS' EVIDENCE --- GENERAL OVERVIEW 
 
150 It is important to observe, at the outset, that neither the Northern Territory nor AFANT mounted any real challenge to the credibility of the witnesses called on site at Timber Creek on behalf of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Some of those witnesses were cross-examined on minor matters of detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Others were questioned with a view to eliciting material thought likely to assist the respondents when they later came to deal with the anthropological evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">151 A total of fourteen witnesses gave evidence on site at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Some evidence was given in confidential session.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">That evidence concerned men only, and was given on a restricted basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">For that reason, it will be necessary to refer to it in only the most general of terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">152 A sealed transcript of the restricted evidence has been retained pending any appeal against this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">THE EVIDENCE GIVEN ON SITE AT TIMBER CREEK 
 
153 Hearings were conducted on site at Timber Creek over a number of days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">During the course of these hearings, several site visits were undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">A detailed outline of those site visits is set out at Schedule C to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">154 The witnesses called on behalf of the claimants were, essentially, elders of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Their evidence is summarised below, on a thematic basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">The only exception to that is Alan Griffiths, whose evidence was by far the most important in support of the claimants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">His evidence is set out in some detail in its own right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">Alan Griffiths 
 
155 It will be recalled that Mr. Griffiths' maternal grandfather was Lamparangana's brother, Mangaramawuk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">156 Mr Griffiths was born in 1933 at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">His father was Old Brumby or Kajungmawuk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">His mother was Clara, Mangaramawuk's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Mr Griffiths was raised at both VRD and Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">157 Mr Griffiths said that every year, during the wet season, Lamparangana (or on occasion, Violet Paliti), would bring him to Timber Creek from VRD so that he could meet up with his relatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">As they passed various sites along the way, his paternal grandfather, Old Jabiru, and his father, Old Brumby, would name those sites and explain their significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">158 Mr Griffiths named some of the people who lived at Timber Creek when he was a young boy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">They included Old Takawuk (Violet Paliti's father), Old Wanampuru (Darby's father), George Mawadgap (Jerry Jones' father), Old Wajaka (Violet's husband), Old Jungarijin (Lamparangana's sister), and Mutpuyula (Jo Lewis' grandfather).</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">Some of these people lived at the homestead, some at the shop, and some at the stock camp nearby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">159 Mr Griffiths described a number of the traditional skills that he had been taught as a child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">He said that had been taught how to make a boomerang, and a didgeridoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">He spoke of corroborees at the Old Depot, and of the practice of Winan ("exchange of goods") that was prevalent at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">He described Winan as "a hard law" that had to be done correctly, through "the right people".</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">He said that the practice continued right up to the present time, going through the senior man for each group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">He explained Winan in the following terms:
 
 "Boomerang comes from Laurie Roberts (for Ngaringman Wuli) to me (for Makalamayi) then to Jerry Jones (for Wanimyn), then to Bradshaw and Daly River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">" 
 

160 Mr Griffiths further explained that boomerangs were brought along the river from the general direction of VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">They came from Mutpura to Karangpuru to Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">Stone spears were brought along the same track from the "Gulugulu mob", while bamboo spears were brought from Daly River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">161 Mr Griffiths said that he was responsible for organising Winan in his country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">In his absence, either Jo Lewis, or Jerry Jones, or one of Mr Griffiths' sons, Chris or Kenny, would act in his place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">162 Mr Griffiths said that he had taught his children how to make didgeridoos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">He had also taught them to hunt in the traditional manner, spearing kangaroo, catching porcupine, and diving for turtle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">He had taught them how to draw their country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">He himself was an accomplished artist, having been taught the art of Aboriginal painting by his grandfather, Mangaramawuk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Indeed, one of his paintings, depicting Timber Creek, was tendered in evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">163 Mr Griffiths said that he had never been to "white fellow school".</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">As a young man he had worked at VRD, and later at other stations in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">In about 1980 he moved to Kununurra, where he now lived, and featured as a commercially successful artist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The reason that he had settled in Kununurra was because his wife, Peggy, an accomplished artist in her own right, was Gadjerrong, and Kununurra was close to her country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">He insisted, however, that he visited Timber Creek regularly, in his own words, "to check up on country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">164 Mr Griffiths said that he had married "the right way" by which he meant "the right skin".</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">His was an arranged marriage, made at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">He outlined some of the customs associated with traditional relationships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">For example, he said:
 
 "You have to keep away from your mother-in-law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">You keep sideways or you might have someone between you if you are both sitting down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">If you are giving something to her you pass with two hands but don't look directly at her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">" 
 

165 Mr Griffiths said that his children and grandchildren all had aboriginal names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">He described his country as Makalamayi, and said that it went up to King Billabong, and out to Gilwi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Beyond King Billabong was Jamijung country, near Bradshaw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">He said that Maiyalaniwung and Makalamayi joined up at Nine Mile (not far from Gilwi).</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Maiyalaniwung was Violet's father's country, and Wunjaiyi joined up at Line Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">He described Timber Creek as a junction for people, and referred in that context to Yanturi and Wantuwul.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">166 Mr Griffiths said that if he wanted to go to Yanturi country he would first speak to Jo Lewis or Josie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">He said that he could fish there, but would not catch any fish unless he "sang out".</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">He could sing out to that country because he knew the old people there, and because Jo Lewis' father had been married to his sister, Pat's, daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">For that reason Jo Lewis could come to Makalamayi, sing out, and camp there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">167 In Mr Griffiths' own words:
 
 "We (Makalamayi) are together 50/50 with Jo Lewis (Yanturi) and Wunjayi mob.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">" 
 

168 Mr Griffiths said that Timber Creek was his mother, Clara's, country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">She took that country from her father, who had died when Mr Griffiths was about ten years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">169 Mr Griffiths said that under traditional laws and customs, he could neither sell the land at Makalamayi, nor give it away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">The country belonged to the people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">It had to be passed on to the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">He said that Lamparangana had taught him these laws and customs, and that he was responsible for ensuring that they were maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">In his absence, Jerry Jones was in charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Mr Jones would telephone him if any problems arose that required his attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">170 Mr Griffiths said:
 
 "It does not matter Aboriginal way that I live at Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Aboriginal law means it's always my country and I come back for meetings whenever they talk about the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">If I don't come back, I send someone from my family to represent me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">" 
 

171 Mr Griffiths reiterated that he visited Timber Creek regularly to check upon the sites, and to ensure that everything was in order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">He said that he was responsible for protecting the Dreamings in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">He described some sites as dangerous, and said that they had to be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">He explained again, as he had done during the earlier site visits, the importance of the head wetting ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">He said that other members of his family, including Jo Lewis, Josie Jones and Jerry Jones, were also able to carry out that ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">172 Mr Griffiths next explained funeral customs in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">He said that when someone died their name would not be spoken for anything up to five or six years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">He said that this was a law from the Dreamtime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">He made it plain, however, that he could not speak openly about these matters as there were women present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">173 Mr Griffiths explained initiation ceremonies ("young man business"), and pointed out that these ceremonies, which had been conducted by his people for generations, were still held today in and around Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">174 Mr Griffiths then spoke of the various sites to which the Court had previously been taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">He said that Lamparangana had shown him the various Dreamings at those sites, and explained again their significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">He also spoke of the traditional foods that were available in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">175 With regard to the languages used at Makalamayi, Mr Griffiths said that he was fluent in Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">He said that he could speak only a few words of Nungali, though he maintained that he could understand that language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">He described Nungali as a "heavy" language, and Ngaliwurru as "light".</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">He said that he spoke Jamijung at Bradshaw, and that he spoke various other languages at other locales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">He said that "the special language" for Makalamayi was Nungali, and that the Shark had "made that language".</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">He attributed Ngaliwurru to the Barramundi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">176 Mr Griffiths said that merely because a person could speak a particular language did not make that person "Yakpali mululu".</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">By that he meant that if an indigenous person came to Timber Creek, say from Alice Springs, and happened to speak Ngaliwurru that did not mean that he owned country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">177 Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths identified on a map the rough boundaries of the different country groups that together make up the claimants in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">He was taken to his witness statement, and asked about the language used in each of the countries to which he had referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">For example, Violet Paliti's father's country was Maiyalaniwung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">The language for that country was Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Old Darby's country was Line Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">Its language was also Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">So too was the language of Wanimiyn, the country of Jerry Jones and his father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">178 Mr Griffiths said that Lamparangana's sister's country was Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">Its language was Ngaliwurru/Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">He said that Jo Lewis' father's country was Mutpuyula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Its language too was Ngaliwurru/Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">179 Mr Griffiths was then asked about the evidence he had given in the Kidman Springs hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">As previously indicated, Justice Olney, found that he was a "traditional Aboriginal owner" of the land in question, as were his children, and his sons' children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">However, Justice Olney found that his daughters' children were not "traditional Aboriginal owners".</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">That was because grandchildren could take country from their father's father, but not from their mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">I should indicate that this line of questioning was of no real assistance, so far as the present proceedings are concerned, given that the test of a "traditional Aboriginal owner" differs so markedly from what must be established under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">180 Mr Griffiths then said that he believed he was about 15 or 16 years of age when Lamparangana died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">He said that after that, neither he nor his family came to Timber Creek for a number of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">He acknowledged that he had never, at any stage, actually lived in Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">He also acknowledged that his sons had all been initiated at Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">When asked whether the "business" was done differently at Kununurra, he replied "same mob, same business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">181 Mr Griffiths said that he had left VRD in about 1957.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">His said that his grandfather (by which by which he plainly meant Lamparangana) had told him to look after Timber Creek, and to protect it against sickness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">182 Mr Griffiths said that he and other members of his family had received compensation when a bridge was built over the Victoria River which damaged the Dingo Dreaming site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">He also said that a young man who had bought the causeway (to which the Court had been taken on a site visit) had subsequently died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">183 When questioned at some length about the languages that he spoke, Mr Griffiths accepted that he knew only a little Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">He said he spoke some Nungali to Josie Jones, and to Jo Lewis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">He said that Lamparangana had spoken both Ngaliwurru and Nungali fluently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">184 Mr Griffiths was then questioned in more detail about Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">He confirmed that Lamparangana was actually his great uncle, his grandfather Mangaramawuk's older brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">He said that he had obtained his Dreamings from Mangaramawuk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">185 Mr Griffiths acknowledged that, shortly before the Timber Creek Land Claim in 1985, he had checked the names of some of the Dreamings with Old Jo Lewis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">He accepted that this was because he was uncertain about several of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">He maintained, however, that he had never forgotten the Dreamings themselves, merely the locations of some of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">He said that his mother's Dreaming was Wirip (the Dingo).</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">This was his Dreaming as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">186 Mr Griffiths was questioned at some length about a meeting that took place some time after Lamparangana's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">The meeting concerned who would take responsibility for Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">He said that under traditional law, when someone in Lamparangana's position died, there had to be discussions about who would succeed him in looking after country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">He said that he recalled one meeting in Kununurra, and possibly another at Timber Creek, on this subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">Those who attended included people from Bradshaw, Yanturi, Gulugulu, Wantawul, Kuwang and Maiyalaniwung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">He said that it was agreed by those who attended that he and his sister, Pat would take over the care of Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">187 In re-examination, Mr Griffiths agreed that he had some difficulty in remembering exact dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">In part this was because he had never learned to count years or months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">He confirmed that his grandfather, Mangaramawuk, was one of four brothers and that he had died when Mr Griffiths was still very young.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">His best recollection was that Lamparangana had had no children of his own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">Evidence of Links to Makalamayi 
 
188 Each of the lay witnesses called at Timber Creek gave evidence of his or her family's links by descent to Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Josie Jones, who is the sister of Jo Lewis, and the wife of Jerry Jones, explained that she took Makalamayi through her connections with Myatt, which was Ngaliwurru land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">However, her kakung country, from her father's father, was Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">189 Mrs Jones said that if someone wished to build in Makalamayi, they would have to "seek permission".</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">They would have to ask Alan Griffiths, Jo Lewis, Jerry Jones, and herself 
 
190 If Alan Griffiths was not around then he would be contacted, and generally come to Timber Creek to discuss the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">In her own words:
 
 "Makalamayi country is still Griffo's even if he is not living in Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">It's ok to live away from your country, it's still your country, I can't change that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">" 
 
 

191 Mrs Jones confirmed Mr Griffiths' account of what had transpired when the bridge over the Victoria River was built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">She said that the bridge had been moved to a different location to protect the Frog Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">She agreed that she had been paid compensation in relation to this matter, and that she was one of a small group, including Alan Griffiths, Jo Lewis and Larry Johns, who had decided how much everyone should receive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">192 Under cross-examination, Mrs Jones agreed that she followed Yanturi, and that it was to that country that she was strongly connected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">Indeed, she accepted that in both the Timber Creek Land Claim, and in the Fitzroy Land Claim she had been found to be a traditional owner of Yanturi, but not of Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">193 She described Mr Griffiths and his sister Pat as having "a great say" over Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">They took that country as their jawajing, or mother's father's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">Their mother, Clara, had taken Makalamayi as her kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">Mrs Jones did not know whether any of the old people, still alive, took Makalamayi as their kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">194 Mrs Jones acknowledged that her connection with Timber Creek arose principally through language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">She agreed that had never met Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">She understood that Lamparangana had had one son, but believed that that son had not had any children of his own.</sentence>

<sentence id="s764">196 Lorraine Jones said that she took country from both her mother and her father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">Yanturi was her jawajing, or mother's father's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Her mother and her uncle (Jo Lewis) were the "main people", still alive, responsible for Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">She said that she assisted her mother in looking after country, and that she passed on her learning about tradition to the younger people in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">She described her mother as a "senior ceremony woman".</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">197 Ms Jones said that the traditional owners among the Ngaliwurru people were the Darby clan, the Griffiths family, Jo Japati (her grandfather) and Duncan McDonald.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">She said that by "traditional owners" she meant that these people's families and elders regarded them as such.</sentence>

<sentence id="s775">He said that he had a "sense of feeling" that he belonged to both VRD and Makalamayi, but acknowledged that he knew little about the area around Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">He said that he had attended five meetings at Timber Creek in the previous year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">He said that his community expected him to take a greater role, in the future in looking after his country, and that he intended to move to Timber Creek at some stage soon.</sentence>

<sentence id="s779">She lives at Yarralin, an outstation at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">She is older than her brother but does not know her exact age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">She said that she took VRD as her country from Old Brumby who, though not her father, had raised her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">She said that Makalamayi was Lamparangana's country, and that he stayed there all the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">She did not know whether it was his kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">She agreed that VRD was her "number one country", but said that she came to Makalamayi on a regular basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">When she was very young, Old Darby had told her that she took Timber Creek as her country through her mother, Clara.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">She remembered Lamparangana well, as she already had three children when he died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">She described him as having been blind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">200 Sammy Darby said that he lived at Muruning (One Mile), just outside Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">He said that his kakung country was Wunjaiyi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">The language there was Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">He said that he could not sell, or give either his Dreaming, or his country, away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">He said that before his father (Old Darby) had died, about four years earlier, he had taught him about "50-50".</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Lamparangana and Old Darby "were in Winan together 50-50".</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">Lamparangana had assisted Old Darby in ceremony, and they each shared the same Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">Lamparangana had said to Old Darby that they should "go 50-50 for this country", and had asked Old Darby to look after Makalamayi after he died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">201 Mr Darby said that the Dingo Dreaming stopped in Makalamayi, and did not extend into Wunjaiyi country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">He said that Old Darby had spoken Ngaliwurru, while Lamparangana spoke only Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">Asked more about "50-50", he agreed that Lamparangana had meant this to imply that they would jointly look after the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">He acknowledged that neither he, nor Old Darby, were traditional owners of Makalamayi, though he said that their countries were located close by each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">202 Mr Darby was questioned in some detail about his use of the term "country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">In his statement he had said:
 
 "Georgie Jones comes into this country through his mother for Wunjaiyi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">I should be brought in when matters are discussed about the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">In the same way that Lamparangana and Darby were 50/50, I go with Jerry and Alan but because they are a bit older and know the country well they might speak up first but I have to still be included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">That's important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">" 
 

203 By "country" he meant "Wunjaiyi".</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">Jerry Jones' country was Wanimiyn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Mr Darby's grandmother's country was Wanimiyn but he was not a traditional owner of that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">Jerry Jones and Alan Griffiths came for meetings about Wunjaiyi country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">He said, "everyone comes" for meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">But he acknowledged that this did not mean that they shared that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">204 In re-examination, Mr Darby said that he recalled having attended a meeting about the bridge over the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">He had done so because Old Darby would have attended any such meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Old Darby had told him that their countries were "joining together", and that Lamparangana had said this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">He said that those who attended the meeting were the "Ngaliwurru people".</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">If the army wanted to build a bridge at Wunjaiyi, the "Ngaliwurru mob" would attend the meeting to discuss it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">When asked who constituted the "Ngaliwurru mob" he said "the Makalamayi mob, the Yanturi mob, Wantawul mob, Wanimiyn mob and Violet's mob".</sentence>

<sentence id="s820">Ngaliwurru was the language for Wanimiyn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">It was also the language for Violet's country, and for Kuwang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">He said that they were "the same mob".</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">206 Mr Jones said that Alan Griffiths had asked him to look after Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">That was because he had grown up in Timber Creek, and knew the place well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">His own Dreaming country was Wanimiyn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">He said that he had been raised by Old Darby, whose country was Wunjaiyi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">207 Mr Jones said that he had known Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">He said that he was about ten years old when Lamparangana died.</sentence>

<sentence id="s837">Old Darby was his mother's older brother.</sentence>

<sentence id="s843">He said:
 
 "Makalamayi and Wunjaiyi come together through culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">We are the same mob.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">We are not too far out for country, we are close up country.</sentence>

<sentence id="s850">" 
 

210 Under cross-examination, Mr Jones said there was one other country (Violet's country) that was "part of the same mob".</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">He said that the Barramundi Dreaming passed through all those countries, and finished at Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">Those four countries got together for meetings because they were connected by that Dreaming, and they all wanted to make sure that the Dreaming was not hurt, even if it was on someone else's country.</sentence>

<sentence id="s957">Her daughters, Lorraine and Deborah also gave evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">230 Mrs Jones said that she regularly fished at Timber Creek, and in the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">She caught shark, catfish, barramundi, salt fish and stingray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">She also went to the water hole to catch bream and bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">She collected bush tucker around Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">During the wet season she would gather gungaberry, which she described as a sweet berry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">She spoke of eating the flower of the water lily, and of gathering bush yam, sugarbag (honey) and fruit off the trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">231 Mrs Jones said that she hunted goanna, bush turkey and kangaroo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">She said that she could fish at Timber Creek at any time she wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">If, however, a white person wanted to go on to the land, he or she should ask permission first so that the important sites could be pointed out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">She said that she collected white ochre from near the burial site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">That ochre was used at ceremony time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">232 She said that she had been taught by both her father and her grandfather that prior to initiation boys were not allowed to eat barramundi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">She had passed this on to her children as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">She said that under traditional law, she could not get too close to her brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">She could talk to him, but had to maintain a safe distance from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">233 Mrs Jones also spoke of burial customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">She said that when she approached the graves, she was required to sing out in Ngaliwurru to tell the spirits that she was coming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Her grandfather, Sandy, was buried in the burial ground which had been the subject of a site visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">She said that Lamparangana was also buried there, as was Lamparangana's sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">She knew the Centipede Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">She and Jerry had helped erect the fence around that site after the land claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">It was a registered site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">If anyone touched the stone, a big mob of centipedes would descend upon them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">She said that anyone whose picture was painted on that stone, and whose name was spoken, would die.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">234 Mrs Jones said that her ngurlu (totem spirit) was the sugarbag which she took from her mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">She described in some detail a women's ceremony that she had attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">She said that she also attended those parts of men's ceremonies that were open to women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">She said that she regarded it as her responsibility to look after all of the sites in the area, and to teach the children about the various Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">She said that some places were dangerous, while others were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">235 Lorraine Jones said that her Dreamings were Possum and Sugarbag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">She had received them from the Dreamtime, through her father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">They were Dreamings for her father's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">She knew that the special Dreaming for Yanturi was the Barramundi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">This was her mother's Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">She had no special Dreaming for Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">She knew that the Wirip had travelled through Timber Creek, but did not know whether it came from another country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">236 Christopher Griffiths said that he had been initiated at Kununurra, after he finished primary school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">He said that, in due course, his own sons would be initiated as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">He had been taught about the Dreamings, but had neglected these teachings while at school.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">However, he had returned to them recently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">He acknowledged that his first marriage had not been in accordance with traditional custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">His first wife was not "promised", but rather someone he had met himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">Indeed, he agreed that his first marriage had been "wrong way" and that he had been required to do ceremonial payback.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">This involved sitting with and showing respect to various elders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">However, his second marriage had been "right way".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">237 Mr Griffiths said that he had been through a head wetting ceremony at the Humpyback Dreaming Site in November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">238 Pat Jatjat said that her special Dreamings were "egg belong snake" and "jiriki" (wind).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">239 Jerry Jones spoke about "jamaran", which he described as being "like an oath on the bible".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">He said that every person had a jamaran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">He gave an example of one in what he termed "heavy" language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">He then gave a further example, and sang Lamparangana's jamaran, which he described as "the noise made by the shark".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">He said that Sammy Darby's jamaran was shark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">240 Regarding fishing, Mr Jones said that "whitefellas" caught fish, and often threw them away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">This was not the "blackfella" way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">There was a rule from the Dreaming that said that you had to eat what you caught.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">However, this was not a major problem, provided the fishermen stayed away from special sacred sites, and did the right thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">241 Deborah Jones said that she knew about the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">She described how the dingo travelled along the hill in Timber Creek and stopped at the waterhole near the Wayside Inn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">She said that the name "Wirip" was Ngaliwurru, and that she was permitted to go to that site because she had to protect it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">242 Ms Jones also knew about the Centipede Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">Old Darby had warned her not to touch that Dreaming because "big mob centipede come out even if you dust with leaf".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">She spoke of the Spider Dreaming, the Shark Dreaming and the Barramundi Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">She described the bush tucker that she ate and how she fished, and hunted in traditional ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">She said that she could do head wetting, and had done it in her mother's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">She said that her father had been born at Timber Creek, and that it was her desire to help look after it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">Her mother, Josie, and Alan Griffiths had told her that she would have to look after Timber Creek if they were to become sick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">243 Jo Lewis said that he had been through an initiation ceremony when young, and that such ceremonies were still held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">There had been one at Kununurra the previous year at which Alan Griffiths had presided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">He described the various Dreamings that he had been taught.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">These included the Barramundi and Dingo Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">He also knew about the fight between the Shark and the Stingray that had taken place at Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">244 Mr Gulwin said that he had gone through an initiation ceremony at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">All of his children had been through similar ceremonies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">He had attended a ceremony at Myatt several years before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">He said that Alan Griffiths was the main person for ceremonies in that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">He knew the ceremony area at Timber Creek, near the burial ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">245 He said that he had been taught about the Dingo Dreaming at Makalamayi by Alan Griffiths, and by Old Darby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">He also knew about the Centipede Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">He fished and hunted in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">246 Roy Harrington described the various Dreamings at Makalamayi, noting that the Barramundi Dreaming was shared with Wantawul and Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">He said that his relatives were buried behind the Timber Creek police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">He said that Lamparangana was buried there as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">Sometimes he fished at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">He was entitled to fish or hunt at any time on his own country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">Language 
 
247 Josie Jones said that although she spoke Ngaliwurru and understood Nungali, and although she described them as "the same language", there were in fact differences between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">The impression that she conveyed was that a number of words in each language were pronounced differently, though the words themselves were the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">248 In addition to Ngaliwurru and Nungali, Mrs Jones said that she spoke Kriol, English, and Jamijung, and that she understood Ngaringman, and Murrinpatha.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">She said:
 
 "Nungali and Ngaliwurru are special language for Wantawul and they are the same words, the same language and the same mob.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">" 
 

249 Lorraine Jones said that Ngaliwurru was the language for Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">When asked whether she had ever heard anyone speak Nungali she replied that her parents had spoken it, though not to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">She said that she understood Nungali, and that she regarded Ngaliwurru and Nungali as the same language, though spoken with different accents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">250 Pat Jatjat said that she spoke Ngaliwurru, Ngaringman and English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">She could also speak and understand a little Jaminjung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">She described Nungali as "too rough".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">251 Jerry Jones acknowledged that some words in Nungali differed from those in Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">For example, sugarbag was "wanjagan" in Ngaliwurru, and "janunitjbari" in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">However, he maintained that both Ngaliwurru and Nungali were essentially the one language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">252 Georgie Jones described Jaminjung and Ngaliwurru as "the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">253 Jo Lewis spoke Nungali, Ngaliwurru, English and Kriol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">He said that he and Jerry Jones could speak to each other in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">He described Nungali and Ngaliwurru as "heavy" and Jaminjung 'a bit lighter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">However, he said there were no real differences between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">254 William Gulwin said he could speak Ngaringman, Mudpurra, and Ngaliwurru, and that he could understand a little bit of Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">He said that if one person spoke Nungali, and the other Ngaliwurru, they would be able to understand each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">255 Roy Harrington said he could speak Jaminjung, Ngaringman and English, and understand Ngaliwurru and Mudpurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">He said Ngaliwurru was "plain talk" while Nungali was "a bit heavy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">256 Violet Paliti spoke Jaminjung, Ngaliwurru, Ngaringman, English and Kriol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">She said she could understand Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">THE CLAIMANTS' ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVIDENCE 
 
257 A central feature of the claimants' case was the evidence given on their behalf by two anthropologists, Dr Kingsley Palmer and Ms Wendy Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">258 Dr Palmer is a consultant with Appleby Consulting Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">He holds a PhD in Anthropology from the University of Western Australia, and also has several other degrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">He is a Member of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, a Fellow of the Australian Anthropological Society, and was between 2001 and 2003 an Executive Committee Member of that body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">He is the author of six books and approximately fifty articles dealing with indigenous matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">He has presented numerous papers at conferences relating to indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">259 Dr Palmer was previously employed by the Northern Land Council between 1982 and 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">Throughout that period, he visited Timber Creek on a number of occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">He also assisted the Northern Land Council from 1996 to 1998 in relation to the Keep River National Park Native Title Claim, which was itself a part of the Miriuwung-Gajerrong Native Title Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">260 Neither the Northern Territory nor AFANT challenged Dr Palmer's professional qualifications, or his capacity to comment upon anthropological issues involving indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">Nor did they attack his credentials to speak as an expert on matters of law and custom that were of singular relevance to the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">261 Ms Asche is employed as a Senior Project Officer Native Title in the Anthropology Branch of the Northern Land Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">She holds an MA in Anthropology from the Northern Territory University, as well as a number of other degrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">She is a Fellow of the Australian Anthropological Society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">She has taught anthropology at the Northern Territory University, and been a Project and Research Officer with the Northern Land Council for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">She has published at least one paper on the subject of aboriginal affiliations and land use patterns in the Timber Creek area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">She has also written broadly on anthropological issues arising from Native Title Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">262 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche prepared a report dated October 2004 in support of the claimants in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">Although described as a "joint report", Dr Palmer was acknowledged to be the senior anthropologist, and the major contributor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">He took particular responsibility for collecting data on matters relating to spiritual life, sites, ritual and belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">He also took the lead role regarding questions of land ownership and the way in which rights to country "were articulated through social processes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">263 Ms Asche nonetheless played a significant role in the preparation of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">She took primary responsibility for those chapters dealing with genealogical data, and also focused upon the connection which the claimants maintained with the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">264 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche said that they took joint responsibility for all aspects of the report, and that they agreed in all of its conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">265 As indicated, the anthropological evidence in this case was the major area of contention between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">It is useful, therefore, to set out in some detail the conclusions reached by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">Background to the Report 
 
266 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche spent some one hundred and twenty-two days in field work before preparing their report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">A good deal of that time was spent at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">However, the authors also visited surrounding communities at Kununurra, Bulla, Yarralin and Pigeon Hole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">In addition, Dr Palmer spent approximately thirty-eight days undertaking archival research.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">Ms Asche then undertook an additional thirty days of field work in preparation for her particular areas of responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">Obviously, an enormous amount of time and effort was put into the preparation of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">267 The authors acknowledge the immense assistance gained from earlier anthropological work carried out in the context of the various land claims brought under the Land Rights Act between 1985 and 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">They utilise the data gathered for those earlier cases, and expressly state that they have built upon it, with a view to updating it, and checking its currency and integrity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">268 The authors discuss in some detail their methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">They say that they carried out many interviews in order to check genealogical data and collect materials relevant to the culture, laws and customs of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">In addition they say that they visited various sites and areas of importance within or adjacent to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">They carried out these visits in order to check the location of places of importance to the claimants, and to document their significance further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">269 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that, having been based in Timber Creek for some weeks, they were also able to participate in other activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">These included fishing or going on expeditions which were described as "characteristic of participant observation techniques employed by anthropologists in attempting to gain insights into a culture".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">The work of Ms Asche in and around Timber Creek meant that she was well-known to the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">She said that this had been particularly advantageous in developing her understanding of kinship and consanguineal links which she regarded as providing one of the principal structures that characterised the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">Review of Anthropological Research 
 
270 The report contains a detailed summary of much of the anthropological research that has been carried out over the years in the Timber Creek area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">The authors refer to the journals left by the early European explorers, and to the historical material (contained in the folder of History Documents discussed earlier in these reasons for judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">They note, in particular, the work of the first anthropologist to visit Timber Creek, the Reverend J.R.B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">Love, who spent time in the area between 1912 and 1914.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">They conclude, however, that his work is of little utility because he did not engage in research that was sustained and rigorous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">271 Of greater significance was the work of Professor Stanner who has previously been mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">Professor Stanner was the first anthropologist to carry out detailed empirical research in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">As a young man he visited Timber Creek for about a week in August or September 1934.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">As previously indicated, his field notes were included in the folder of History Documents tendered before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">Those field notes assume considerable importance in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">272 In Professor Stanner's account, he described both the Ngaliwurru and Ngaringman communities, attributing the country of the former to the area "roughly between the Depot [Timber Creek] and Victoria River Downs, inside the great left-hand curve of the Victoria River in this area".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">273 The Depot to which he referred was established in the early 1890s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">It consisted of a store, and hotel, adjacent to a jetty that provided a landing from the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">The Depot was located approximately five kilometres north-west of Timber Creek, not far from the present airstrip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">274 Professor Stanner worked with the Ngaliwurru at VRD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">However, he cut short his field work there in order to visit Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">He said that he did so because "the bulk of the Ngarinman were at Victoria River".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche point out that the reference to "the Ngarinman" was plainly erroneous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">In context, Professor Stanner undoubtedly meant the Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">275 Professor Stanner also gave a detailed account of the Jaminjung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that Professor Stanner was likely to have carried out his research into the Jaminjung while he was at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">276 Professor Stanner wrote two important articles resulting from his field work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">The first, in 1936, dealt with "kinship and totemism".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">The second, in 1937, set out in detail the names of those whom he had interviewed during his visit to the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">It appears that most of his data was taken from the Port Keats area but there were some references to the Jaminjung in the context of his discussion of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">277 Professor Stanner discussed the division of "tribal territories" into "countries" (Yakpali).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">He employed two terms in this context, "local group" and "horde".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche criticize that analysis as incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">They conclude that his use of the term "horde" was intended to encompass more than one local descent group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">278 Professor Stanner acknowledged that his field work had been less than satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">Nonetheless, he recorded a tenurial system amongst the Jaminjung whereby sets of individuals comprising descent groups were attached to country through "totemic principles".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">He concluded that the groups that used the country (and so might be assumed to have had rights to do so) were made up of several local or sub-groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">279 According to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, Professor Stanner's analysis of totemism among the Jaminjung represents the most obscure aspect of his work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">I have read this material, and I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">It would be pointless, for present purposes, to attempt to synthesise his views upon this subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">The significance of his work on this issue, so far as this case is concerned, lies in the fact that he visited Timber Creek fifty or so years after European settlers first occupied this region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">By the time Professor Stanner arrived, the lifestyles of the indigenous inhabitants must already have undergone considerable change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">Yet his work disclosed some key aspects of indigenous culture that offered a view into the traditional pre-contact systems of law and belief that probably held sway not just among the Jaminjung, but also among their close neighbours, the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">280 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche next analyse the linguistic research that has been undertaken in relation to Jaminjung, Ngaliwurru and Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">They note that all three languages are regarded, linguistically, as part of the same language family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">They refer in particular to a leading paper upon this subject, JE Bolt, WG Hoddinott and FM Kofod, " An Elementary Grammar of the Ngaliwurru Language of the Northern Territory " (unpublished manuscript, AIATSIS, Canberra 1971).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">They observe that the three "languages" are described, in one study, as mere "dialects" of the one broader language: JR Cleverly, " A Preliminary Study of the Phonology and Grammar of Djamindjung " (MA thesis, University of New England 1968).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">281 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche rely heavily upon a more recent linguistic study by EF Schultze-Berndt, " Simple and Complex Verb in Jaminjung .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">A Study of Event Categorisation in an Australian Language" (PhD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">thesis (2000), Catholic University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">In their view, this thesis confirms that Jaminjung and Ngaliwurru are "closely related" being part of the Jaminjungan language family, and "more distantly" related to Nungali, which is said to be "almost extinct".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">282 Turning again to the previous anthropological research undertaken in the region, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that, in their opinion, much of this work is relevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">A number of the claimants in the various land rights claims dealt with between 1985 and 1992 happen also to be claimants in the proceedings now before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">Moreover, the land the subject of those claims surrounds, or is at least closely proximate to, Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">283 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that the Kidman Springs/Jasper Gorge Land claim concerned an area some forty-five kilometres south-east of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">The anthropological submission filed in support of that claim, (which was prepared by Professor Rose and Mr Lewis, both acknowledged experts in their field), identified six country groups (one of which, Kuwang, extended into the Stokes Range claim), whose members had been found to have rights as traditional Aboriginal owners in the earlier Timber Creek Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">284 Professor Rose and Mr Lewis described what they termed "primary" rights to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">These rights rested with those who claimed rights to country "through the principle of cognatic descent", a concept that will feature heavily in these reasons for judgment, and to which I shall return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">Senior members of this group had responsibility for "speaking" for country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">They also had the right to grant or withhold permission for others to use the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">285 The implication of what Professor Rose and Mr Lewis had to say was that there existed also "secondary" rights, which regrettably they neither described, nor defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">However, according to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, it was significant that Justice Olney, as Land Commissioner, concluded that a number of individuals were traditional owners of more than one country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard that conclusion, involving as it does the recognition of overlapping interests, as the natural consequence of a system that recognised cognatic descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">286 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that in their opinion the most substantial piece of anthropological research relevant to the Timber Creek region is that undertaken by Professor Rose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">She worked at Yarralin between 1980 and 1982, and returned to the area on many occasions thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">287 In her book Dingo Makes Us Human (to which I have previously referred), Professor Rose cites ethnographic material that Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard as relevant not just to Yarralin, but also to Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">Her book includes sections on Aboriginal spirituality, the Dreamings, and relations with the natural world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">It provides a detailed account of kinship, and the duty to look after country, as well as a duty to have regard for the wellbeing of visitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">288 Importantly for present purposes, Professor Rose concludes that rights to country in the Victoria River region are, and have for many years been, inherited cognatically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche describe a cognatic system of descent as one where there may be "multiple affiliations" to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">Indeed, indigenous people may have ownership rights in "a number of different countries".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">They may be "fifty" or "50/50" (share equally), especially where there is a shared Dreaming affiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">289 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note Professor Rose's comment that, usually, a person can live in, hunt in, and take active care of, only one country at a time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">Professor Rose observes that this principle has been modified somewhat by the greater access that indigenous people now have to modern transportation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">290 Professor Rose describes marriage as a mechanism whereby countries may be linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">She concludes that since countries in the Victoria River district are, and have been, exogamous (exogamy is the custom of marrying outside the tribe or other social unit, and should be contrasted with endogamy), and rights to country pass by cognatic descent, control and direction of marriage choices is a key means by which subsequent rights to country can be constrained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">291 After carefully considering the past anthropological research at Timber Creek, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche conclude that there is a basic consistency between Professor Stanner's early work, and the work of later anthropologists such as Professor Rose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">They conclude that Professor Stanner's research, though undertaken some fifty years or so after European settlement, indicated that traditional beliefs and practices remained strongly in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">In their view, the anthropological data, and the ethnography, indicate an enduring continuity of belief and practice which developed from a fundamental cultural system that underpinned the society in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">292 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche recognise that there are no contemporaneous records to which they can turn in order to obtain a comprehensive account of the pre-contact cultural practices followed by earlier indigenous inhabitants of the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">They say that it would be unrealistic to expect any such records to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">Certainly, the early explorers of the region said little that survives about the lifestyle and customs of the indigenous inhabitants at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">However, such snippets of information as are available from this period paint a picture that is broadly consistent with that described by Professor Stanner during the course of his visit to the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">293 In summary, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche are of the view that that the claimants observe the same, or substantially similar, customs, laws and practices, as did the indigenous inhabitants of the region at the time of, and prior to the acquisition of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche are also of the view that they share essentially the same beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">The Claimant Community 
 
294 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche next deal specifically with the claimant community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">They see the claimants as people who regard themselves as having certain important things in common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">Many live in, or close to, Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">Some live in the town itself while others live on adjacent outstations and settlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">These include One Mile (one mile south of Timber Creek police station), Myatt (six kilometres south of the town), and Gilwi (fifteen kilometres south-east of the town).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche recognise that a number of the claimants live well away from Timber Creek, for example at Yarralin, Pigeon Hole, Bulla and even Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">However, in their view, Timber Creek remains the focal point for all of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">It is to Timber Creek that people travel when attending meetings of any consequence regarding land rights or native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">In addition, Timber Creek is itself an important centre for religious practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">295 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche describe the claimants as a "social formation", the members of which identify themselves by use of a range of referents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">The community is "bounded", with rules for recruitment and exclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">As with all social units, its membership will change over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">However, the "originating referential criteria for its existence are constant, being founded in religious belief, and concomitant practice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">296 For the claimants, identification is typically by reference to one of several named areas of country, or "estates".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">These areas are commonly called Yakpali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">A person is linked to a particular country by descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">Those who trace common descent and common affiliation to the same country together comprise "a group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">Anthropologists generally call these groups "descent groups".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">297 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that, at Timber Creek, a descent group member generally cites both matrifiliation and patrifiliation as a source of spiritual attachment to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">Therefore, in their view the system can be characterised as a "cognatic descent system".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">298 As previously indicated, in a cognatic descent system people often claim affiliation with several countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">A person might also demonstrate attachment to country by referring to matters other than descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">For example, an association with country can be reinforced by reference to spiritual beings of the Dreaming who are thought to be connected with the country in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">These spiritual beings, or "Dreamings", perform actions that result in both physical and spiritual modification to the countryside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">A member of a country group will have a special spiritual tie with that country's Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">Since some Dreamings range widely over the landscape, their spirituality can encompass more than one country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">299 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that shared Dreamings and ties of kinship are also complemented by exchange relationships developed through the practice of a ritualised trade known as Winan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">This creates a particular relationship between trading partners, often of neighbouring countries, characterised by reciprocal obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">300 According to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, there is an ideology that responsibility for and use of a grouping of countries is a matter for the members of a social unit consisting of an amalgamation of a number of country groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">They describe this social unit as "the applicant community".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">However, they recognise that members of that community use a number of different names when referring to themselves, depending upon the circumstances, and the context of the discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">301 Their reasons for concluding that the claimants share a culture and identify with each other include the common understandings regarding their relationship with the natural world, and their participation in activities founded upon a shared spiritual belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">The claimants have characteristics that are similar to those of other indigenous communities in the Victoria River district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">However, aspects of their beliefs can also be found in varying forms throughout indigenous societies in many parts of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">302 The authors say that, for the claimants, a belief in the Dreaming is fundamental to any discussions about land, human relationships and customary practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">At Timber Creek, the concept of the Dreaming is expressed by the term "puwaraj".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">That term has a number of meanings, depending on context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">It refers in one sense to a period of time, long ago, when things were different to the way they now are.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">During that time, super beings roamed the earth and performed numerous activities now recounted in narrative and song, and rehearsed in ritual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">The Dreaming beings often metamorphosed, and became places or sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">However, they could also be understood to have continued their travels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">Their spirituality remains potent, and the areas with which they were directly associated are regarded as inviolable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">303 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche also say that the Dreamings are supernatural forces that cannot be altered, directed or controlled by humans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">They have about them the immutable quality of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">That is why the rules and ways of doing things that are believed to have been ordained during the Dreaming are often referred to as "the Law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">Social institutions, including principles of descent, are believed to be the product of the Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">So too, it is said, is the very language used within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">304 Puwaraj is manifest not only at sites in the landscape, but also through the reproduction of certain designs used in ritual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">In that context, these are described as "photographs" indicating that they are both reproductions of something real (the Dreaming) and a way of representing it symbolically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">In substance, the system of rights relating to puwaraj indicates that within the cognatic descent system there is, at least in ritual dealings, a priority accorded to country claimed through patrifiliation (whether father's father or mother's father).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">305 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that they can discern other features that link the claimants to each other, and to various places and things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">These include the practice of exchanging or adopting the same name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">They observe, from the genealogical data, that the use of ancestral names is common among the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">So too is the allocation of country names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">Another set of common referents is the shared totemic beliefs among the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">For example, Alan Griffiths' ngulu is a small bird called ninipi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">That happened to also be his mother, Clara's mother's ngulu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">At one time it was considered that people of the same ngulu should not marry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">Though that prohibition was no longer regarded as absolute, respect for ngulu animals remains important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">306 Similarly, the authors conclude that the claimants all regard themselves as having inherited from their fathers, and from their father's fathers, a kuning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">Alan Griffiths' kuning is a goanna.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">Jerry Jones' kuning is a sugarbag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">Though a person can eat his or her kuning, they might "feel sorry" for it, and choose not to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">The authors note that this kuning lore was documented as far back as the 1930s by Professor Stanner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">307 All the claimants interviewed by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche spoke a form of English that one linguist had classified as "Creole" (commonly spelt 'Kriol").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">Indigenous languages that were typically associated with a particular area or region were, however, an important means of establishing an identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">308 Earlier research at Timber Creek had identified the local indigenous community as speaking one or more of three languages, Jaminjung, Ngaliwurru and Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">As previously indicated, some linguists regard these merely as dialects, and part of a single language group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">However, Ngaliwurru is said to have more in common with Jaminjung than with Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">The claimants themselves recognise the three languages as simply different ways of speaking, but regard Ngaliwurru and Nungali as "the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">Ngaliwurru is described as "light" and Nungali as "heavy", "a bit rough", and "a bit deep".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">However, regardless of what language the claimants speak, the people are said to be "all the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">309 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that, according to the claimants, all three languages were brought to the area by "Dreaming beings".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">The attribution of language to place by Dreaming is encapsulated in song.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">Language goes with country, consistent with the Dreaming narrative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">For example, Nungali is said to have originated at Yanturi, north-east of Timber Creek, and to have progressed down towards Gilwi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">Jaminjung is said to be located primarily north of the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">Generally, Makalamayi is believed to be associated with Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1266">Indeed, Lamparangana and his brothers were often described as "the Nungali mob".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1267">310 When asked by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche about the difference between Ngaliwurru and Nungali, Mr Griffiths' response was that they were "all the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1268">Indeed, the facility with which almost all of those who were interviewed rolled the two languages into one was a feature of their discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1269">The conflation of the two languages led to some confusion over the identity of country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1270">In essence, these languages are understood to be different, but at the same time to be the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1271">At the very least, they are closely linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1272">311 Given the few remaining people who can speak Nungali, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard any distinction between it and Ngaliwurru as essentially devoid of practical utility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1273">It is entirely apt, in their view, to describe the claimants in this case as the "Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1274">Nothing of any consequence turns upon the subtleties of linguistic differentiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1275">That is because a person's status as "owner", or Yakpali mululu, is not dependent upon that person's capacity to speak the language with which that person's country is formally identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1276">312 The authors recognise that there are parts of Australia where language groups are so closely linked to particular territory that it is appropriate to classify the members of those groups as something akin to "tribes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1277">However, in their view, this does not hold true for Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1278">Given the looseness of linguistic analysis in the area, and recalling Professor Stanner's accounts of the country as being associated with the three languages typically used, they conclude that language can only be regarded as a broad indicium of social grouping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1279">313 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that modern linguists have concluded that the language spoken at Timber Creek was a: 
 
 "synthesis of Nungali, Ngaliwurru and Jaminjung, with some English which formed a Creole and was used as a distinctive identifier of the applicant community".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1280">
 

314 These linguists stress that Ngaliwurru and Nungali are seldom differentiated, and that the country traditionally associated with each is now shared among all those who make up the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1281">315 In any event, as Dr Palmer and Ms Asche emphasise, language is but one of a number of ways by which the claimants identify themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1282">Taking Country 
 
316 The most important aspect of the evidence of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, at least for present purposes, is their discussion of ancestral and genealogical ties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1283">In their report, they note that the claimants live in households comprising extended family groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1284">They say that, in their opinion, there is a recognised system of kinship, and shared ancestry, whereby every individual is assigned one of eight subsection terms (also known as the "skin system") at birth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1285">That system operates in conjunction with the kinship system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1286">When the two are combined, they enable all known members of a community to understand their relationships to one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1287">317 The report comments upon the specific ways in which people are expected to act towards particular kin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1288">For example, an open and jocular relationship is acceptable with the mother of one's mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1289">However, a brother and sister cannot look at each other, speak directly to each other, or sit together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1290">Neither can speak the other's name, even to a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1291">There is also a prohibition upon looking at, or speaking directly with, one's mother in-law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1292">318 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that all of the claimants with whom they had spoken knew their subsection term and regarded the system as vital to their being.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1293">They accepted what they were told, largely on the basis that, while checking genealogies, the claimants were able, without exception, to provide their own subsection terms, those of their forbears, and of their children and other relatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1294">They regarded the use of kinship relationships, and subsection terms in this way as consolidating the homogeneity of the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1295">319 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard Winan as the next unifying characteristic of the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1296">They see it as involving more than simply the exchange of needed items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1297">Rather, Winan is said to be founded upon spiritual principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1298">They note that Timber Creek is regarded, even today, as an important centre for this ritual trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">According to Jo Lewis, Winan was formerly conducted at the Old Depot, currently the site of the Timber Creek airstrip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">The area where Timber Creek now stands was in a strategic position, on the banks of a major river, relatively close to desert environments to the south, and tropical coastal areas to the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">Myatt too was said to be a centre for Winan activity, and that remains the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1302">As recently as 2003, spears were still being traded down from the north (presumably from Daly River).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">320 According to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, the Winan route is not a matter of choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">It was ordained in the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">In Timber Creek it was the Dingo (Wirip) that first carried the commodities now characteristically traded along this route.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">The movement of goods along the "Winan road" was not a matter of traversing distance, but of cementing relationships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">321 It should be noted that there is a good deal more to Winan than this cursory description, drawn from the joint report, can explain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">There are ritual and ceremonial aspects that were the subject of the restricted evidence led before me, and to which I cannot refer openly in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">322 In conclusion, on this aspect of "taking country", Dr Palmer and Ms Asche observe that the areas of land identified by the claimants as Yakpali, are often rendered in English as "countries".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">Some anthropologists, including Professor Stanner, prefer to adopt the term "estates".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1311">In the area of Timber Creek, it is often the case that particular countries will be named, for convenience, after a spiritually important, though not necessarily very central, site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">323 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that the term "Yakpali" is often used in conjunction with a possessive form, for example, "Lamparangana's country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1313">They conclude that the indigenous inhabitants of Timber Creek understand the land to belong to a particular group whose members are all related through consanguinity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1314">Those inhabitants regard rights to land as being gained principally by descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1315">However, they recognise that a senior member of the group will often be nominated as a point of reference for the group as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1316">Countries and Members of the Country Groups 
 
324 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that, in ordinary parlance, "country" or "estate" are terms which imply clear boundaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1317">However, this is not the case at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1318">There a "country" tends not to be defined with precision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1319">Indeed, the authors are at pains to point out that there is no word in Ngaliwurru for "boundary".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1320">Limits of country are defined by reference to both a place (meaning a site), and the knowledge of spiritual matters over which an owner has legitimate authority that relates to that place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1321">Such rights stem from the Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">For example, the right to use a Dreaming design, to recount a narrative, or to sing the songs about the country, is the prerogative of those affiliated to the country, pursuant to the normative system that operates in the particular area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">325 The authors emphasise, therefore, that at least with regard to Timber Creek, the concept of "country" should not be confused with the idea of a bounded estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">Ownership of country cannot be understood in any isolated geographic spatial way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">Those who exercise the rights of owners do so in a broader context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">326 It is for that reason, according to the report, that the claimants listed five countries, and their constituent country groups, when they identified their rights to the Timber Creek town site, and adjacent areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">As a consequence, they identified the members of these five country groups as, together, making up the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">327 The authors single out one country, Makalamayi, for detailed consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">As previously noted, Timber Creek falls entirely within Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1330">Indeed, Makalamayi is named after a significant site at the junction of Timber Creek and the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1331">328 The authors say that, according to tradition, Makalamayi is associated with three brothers: Niyamo Yam, Mangaramawuk and Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1332">They say that it is hardly surprising that the accounts of Lamparangana's life vary greatly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1333">They note that there is some evidence to suggest that he had a son, Albert Yiwarangana, who was shot and killed long before Lamparangana died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1334">However, as previously mentioned, other accounts suggest that Lamparangana had no children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1335">329 The authors say that it seems clear that Niyamo Yam had no children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1336">However, Mangaramawuk had a daughter, Clara, who was, of course, the mother of Alan Griffiths and Pat Jatjat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1337">Alan Griffiths' rights to Makalamayi pass to his children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1338">Pat Jatjat's son, William Gulwin, is linked to Makalamayi through his mother, and then through her mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1339">However, Mr Gulwin generally emphasises his links to Wantawul, rather than Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1340">Wantawul is his country through his father, Donley Tingiamkari.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1341">330 Though the claimants focus heavily upon Makalamayi, they identify four other countries, in relation to which they claim native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1342">331 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that, to the immediate east of Makalamayi is Wunjaiyi, named after an important site at the junction of Line Creek and the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1343">The senior claimants from Wunjaiyi are the children of Old Darby, including in particular, Sammy Darby and Georgie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">Without labouring the evidence concerning matters of genealogy, the links between Wunjaiyi and Makalamayi are clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">Old Darby's sister was married to Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">After Lamparangana's death, she married George Tajpajani, who was Georgie Jones' father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">332 East from Wunjaiyi is Yanturi --- named after an important site in the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">The senior claimants connected with Yanturi include Jo Lewis and Josie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">She, of course, is married to Jerry Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">They have direct patrilineal links to a man called Mutpuyula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">333 Many members of this same group are also genealogical members of Wantawul, which is located further east of Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">Wantawul is named after a large hill which is located a short distance north west of Fitzroy Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">The authors note that the senior claimants from Wantawul include Larry Johns, Roy Harrington, Doris Paddy and William Gulwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">334 There is little point in going through the elaborate detail of the genealogies prepared by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche on behalf of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">Two sketch genealogies were included in the report itself, and a number of others were tendered as an appendix to that report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">The two sketch genealogies and a partial summary of at least some key aspects of the genealogy relating to Makalamayi are appended to these reasons for judgment, as Schedules D, E and F.
 
335 There was no objection by the respondents to the tender of this genealogical material, though its accuracy was not conceded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">However, the evidence given by a number of the older claimants suggests that the genealogies are, broadly speaking, reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">That conclusion is also supported by the evidence given in the four land claims brought under the Land Rights Act , transcripts of which were also tendered in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">336 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that it is clear that Yanturi and Wantawul are closely linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">Indeed, Justice Gray in his report as Land Commissioner concluded that these two countries, or estates, had been essentially amalgamated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">337 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that there is a history of Wantawul women having married Yanturi men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">Both Yanturi and Wantawul are adjoined, along the Victoria River, and at Bradshaw Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">They are linked by the same Dreamings, and assert affiliations to ancestral beings that are common to both countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">The importance of this, so far as the present proceedings are concerned, is that Yanturi and Wantawul are linked through those Dreamings to Makalamayi and Wunjaiyi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">338 South and south-west of Makalamayi is Maiyalaniwung, sometimes known as "Violet's country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">The country name comes from a particular site located south of Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">The senior claimants from Maiyalaniwung are Violet Paliti and Nida Kalikari.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">Maiyalaniwung is linked to Wunjaiyi through Sammy Darby's mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">339 As previously mentioned, these five countries, Makalamayi, Wunjaiyi, Yanturi, Wantawul and Maiyalaniwung have all featured in earlier land claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">There was a good deal of evidence before Commissioner Maurice in the Timber Creek Land Claim regarding the links between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">His characterisation of each country, drawn from the evidence given in that proceeding, is broadly consistent with the views expressed by the authors of the joint report in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">340 One thing that Dr Palmer and Ms Asche are firmly convinced of is that the only way in which indigenous persons can take country at Timber Creek is via the principle of descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">They say that no one can be regarded as a Yakpali mululu except in accordance with that principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">341 They point out, however, that Timber Creek may be unusual in that the custom among the indigenous inhabitants of the area is to recognise descent through either the patrilineal or matrilineal line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">342 In other words, according to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, affiliation to country in Timber Creek can be established in one of four distinct ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">A person can take country through his or her paternal grandfather, paternal grandmother, maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">They characterise the first two principles of descent as "patrilineal", and the second two principles of descent as "matrilineal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">It should be noted that they regard an adoptive relationship as equivalent to one that is consanguineal, provided, of course, that the adoption is socially sanctioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">343 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that a system such as this, whereby land passes through either the male or female line is usually described by anthropologists as a cognatic descent system, or in short, a cognatic system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">They say that during the course of their extensive fieldwork, however, the majority of the indigenous persons that they interviewed spoke of their father's father's country, which they termed their "kakung", and their mother's father's country, in relation to which they used the term "jawajing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">Alan Griffiths told them that, for him, his jawajing country "comes first", but that there was a choice and that "no one way was right".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">They described claims to jawajing as "indirectly patrilineal", filation being via the female line for, potentially, only one generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">This is somewhat confusing, given that this relationship is in fact matrilineal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">It should be noted that not all of the claimants agree with Alan Griffiths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">For example, Jo Lewis and Josie Jones told Dr Palmer and Ms Asche that they regarded jawajing country as being in some respects subsidiary to kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">They tended to name their father's country when asked for their country, putting it first when enumerating their ties to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">344 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that although some claimants, initially at least, appear to be reluctant to describe their rights and interests as having passed to them through the matrilineal line, they also state that matrilineal inheritance is recognised, and that an interest in country can be gained by reference to one or more of a number of other principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">345 The authors observe that Alan Griffiths, for whom Makalamayi is his jawajing country, acknowledges that his claim, in that capacity, has to be inferior to any claim that might be brought by an indigenous person for whom Makalamayi would be their kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">However, there was no one who could make any such claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">Accordingly, a jawajing claim, which was patrilineal, being the highest extant claim, and recognised as such by all those with an interest in the claim area, would ordinarily prevail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">346 A number of the indigenous persons who gave evidence before Commissioner Maurice referred to their countries by reference to male ancestry only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">They listed themselves, and members of their patriline, first, when responding to questions about responsibilities for sites, and their links with country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">However, according to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche it was significant that these same witnesses also recognised matrilineal inheritance, and indeed, recognised that an interest in country might be able to be gained by other means as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">347 The anthropological evidence before Commissioner Maurice in the Timber Creek Land Claim was that the country groups in relation to Timber Creek were patrilineal "in their upper levels".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">However, that evidence went on to suggest that these country groups included the offspring of women, as well as men, at least at "the middle and lower levels".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">The evidence suggested that, in general, a patrilineal bias existed, but a wider cognatic descent principle was also recognised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">Indeed, that wider cognatic system was said by the claimants who gave evidence in that proceeding to have been operating for at least two or three generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">348 Commissioner Maurice concluded that, there had been a gradual breakdown of the patrilineal descent system, in its pure sense, at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">He considered that, over time, equal status had been accorded to the "larger cognatic kin group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">Whatever the precise dynamics of that process, he was satisfied that there was a group made up of the patrilineal and matrilineal descendants of six old world patriclans who, together, constituted the local descent group and, as such, had undifferentiated, and hence primary, spiritual responsibility in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">349 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that a series of questions developed from Commissioner Maurice's findings which, together, raised the issue of whether there had been a significant change in the way in which country groups were now recruited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">In the authors' terms:
 
 "Put at its most simple, were country groups pre-contact recruited patrilineally?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">Is there evidence that this was so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">Does the change to a cognatic system indicate a fundamental alteration to the manner of recruitment to the country group?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">Does 'patrilineal bias' indicate a preference for claiming patrifiliation founded upon historical principles?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">" 
 

350 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that neither the anthropological evidence, nor the scholarly literature upon the subject, provides a concluded or agreed view on these questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">They say that until approximately twenty or so years ago, there was undoubtedly an assumption among anthropologists that country groups were patrilineally recruited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">However, evidence produced as a result of extensive research into land claims has shown that this may not in fact have been the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">In addition, it is now clear that rights to country can be gained in a number of ways, patrilineal descent being but one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">351 For Dr Palmer and Ms Asche it is particularly significant to note that the evidence presented in the various land claims concerning the area around Timber Creek was consistent, and supported the view that cognatic descent had become a common principle by which people expressed affiliation to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">They consider that it is possible that demographic, social and economic changes resulted in a change to the way in which patrifiliation was regarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">None of the Land Commissioners who considered the evidence relating to descent in those cases, with the possible exception of Commissioner Maurice, had concluded that there was anything unusual, or untoward, about the notion that a cognatic system had developed, and been recognised, at some point prior to sovereignty, and certainly prior to European contact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">352 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche emphasise that patrifilial descent was, and still is, an important means whereby people in Timber Creek affiliate to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">For men, at least, knowledge of country is gained through ritual induction and instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">These are the prerogatives of a father, and not of a mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">Having said that, however, it is also possible that a young man can gain knowledge about his mother's country from his mother's brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">Indeed, there are recorded instances of this having occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">In other words, though the operating principle in relation to gaining rights to country is that of descent, this can operate either through the patriline or the matriline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">353 In any event, the principle of descent must be complemented with the requisite knowledge of country to enable any rights to country to be realised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">Critically, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say:
 
 "There may have been a shift over time, and the number of patrifiliates has decreased while the number of matrifiliates has increased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">However, and in our view, the normative system underpinning the acquisition of rights to land has not changed, only its emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">" 
 

354 The authors disagree with Commissioner Maurice's observation, in the Timber Creek Land Claim, that the original "patriclans" had collapsed into a single group that made up the claimant community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">They say that the data that they have collected, as well as the material that was been put before the Commissioner, suggests that the integrity of the country groups remains strong, and is a fundamental component in any characterisation of the land owning system in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">More specifically, they reject any notion of a collapse of an earlier traditional system where country groups operated independently into some different, more cohesive, social group, operating under a new normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">355 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche point out that in a cognatic system there is, theoretically, an ever increasing range of countries available for claim through filiation, as each generation succeeds its predecessor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">That is because, in a cognatic system, a child can claim filiation to each of the four countries of his or her grandparents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">Theoretically, each grandparent would also be able to claim filiation to the country of each of his or her grandparents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">In other words, the number of countries would increase exponentially with each generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">356 The authors stress, however, that the possibility of such exponential growth is more apparent than real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">In practical terms, although people can claim rights to more than one country, the number of countries they can assert as their own is severely constrained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">Genealogical memory is shallow, so it is unlikely that anyone will remember the country filiations of forbears higher than four generations above themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">Moreover, most people tend to stress the country of one forbear, generally, though not always, their kakung country, and to neglect others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">The reason is simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">It involves little more than the recognition of the practical reality that filiation to country involves more than just an assertion of a relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">It requires relevant knowledge of the country in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">A person has a finite capacity to gain such knowledge, given that it has to be accompanied by at least some period of residence, and familiarity with relevant sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">There is a limit to the amount of knowledge of this kind that can, in practice, be absorbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">This explains why people tend to focus upon the area where they live, or at least upon the area that adjoining it, when they make claims to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">More distant regions, which can be linked through filiational attribution only, therefore become less important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">It follows that a cognatic system, though more likely to be flexible than a patrilineal system, will nonetheless still not be entirely open ended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">357 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche emphasise that in matters relating to country, not all are equal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">While cognation might be a sine qua non of ownership, it is by no means sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">In particular, knowledge of ritual practice, leading to standing within the community, is essential when considering any claim to take country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">Since it will normally take many years to attain the relevant knowledge, status within an indigenous community is often a reflection of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">An example proffered was William Gulwin's reluctance to speak about matters relating to Makalamayi, deferring to his mother and his uncle because of their vastly greater status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">358 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche observe that claimants sometimes rest their affiliation to country on a number of other referents apart from cognation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">For example, those who share Dreamings, or engage in Winan, or have an alliance developed through name exchange, may call upon their relationship to legitimate the adoption of a role in the affairs of a country to which they have no ancestral connection through descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">Such claims will not earn the attribution of Yakpali mululu, which is reserved for those who gain country though descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">Nonetheless, they may give rise to native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">359 The authors say that Jerry Jones provides a useful example of this principle in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">As previously indicated, he is regarded as an important person at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">However, Timber Creek is not his kakung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">Rather, Wanimiyn, which is situated south of Coolibah Station, near Stokes Range, fulfils that role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">Mr Jones is not filiated to any of the forbears belonging to the five countries that are the subject of focus in the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">Nonetheless, he has considerable standing within the Timber Creek community, based upon his knowledge of ritual and spiritual matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">In that regard, he follows his father who was also a ritual leader at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">As previously noted, Alan Griffiths has appointed him his deputy, relying on him to look after Makalamayi in Mr Griffiths' absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">360 Of course, Jerry Jones lives at Myatt and is married to Josie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">Her kakung country is Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">As previously noted Yanturi and Wanimiyn are closely associated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">Jerry Jones has a connection to Yanturi through Dreamings, and through his marriage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">His children claim Yanturi through their mother, and Wanimiyn through him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">His connections with Yanturi and Wanimiyn, and his detailed knowledge of ritual practice in Makalamayi, taken together, explain why Mr Jones has attained the status that he has at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">Rights and Duties of Members of Country Groups 
 
361 From an anthropological perspective, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say that the members of the various country groups that they identify can be said to have various gradations of rights of ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">These include access rights, exclusion rights, rights that relate to intellectual property, and "use and benefit rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">The authors identify various duties as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">These include a duty to protect country, a duty to care for country, and a duty to care for visitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">362 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche note that Alan Griffiths referred to the Ngaliwurru and Nungali people "sharing" Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">Mr Griffiths said that the members of each of the five country groups in question could enter the other countries freely, without asking permission of anyone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">The only constraint applied to women who would have to ask first in order to make sure that they did not contravene any secret ritual business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">Members of other groups, including, for example, the Ngaringman, would need to ask first, unless they were travelling for Winan, in which case, they could enter Ngaliwurru and Nungali country freely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">363 The authors point out that Sammy Darby said that he could go anywhere in Makalamayi without asking permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">He said that he was free to hunt, fish and gather food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">When asked about other countries, such as Yanturi, he said that, as a courtesy, he would let the senior owners know, but that he might do so only after he had been there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche conclude that Mr Darby's reticence had more to do with protocols, and respect for the spirituality of the countryside, than with any actual requirement to ask permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">364 Jerry Jones told Dr Palmer and Ms Asche that he regarded himself as being entitled to fish, camp, hunt, take ochre, and induct strangers in Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">He said that those who were not members of the Nungali-Ngaliwurru community were expected to ask permission before doing any of these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">365 In the authors' view, all members of the claimant group were entitled to use the resources of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">However, that entitlement was tempered by "a spiritual reality" which explained why some people were reluctant to venture too far into country without the guidance of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">For strangers, such guidance was essential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">In effect, asking permission was irrelevant because to go somewhere unknown, without that guidance, would be to court disaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">366 The report concludes that the claimants share a belief that many places in the countryside are dangerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">The authors provide a number of examples of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">In their words, the countryside is "a minefield of deadly spirituality".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">367 When it comes to the claimants' right to control intellectual property relating to Makalamayi, this is said, in the report, to be best illustrated by the use of body designs (often referred to as "photographs"), songs and narratives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">These are seen as the property of the countrymen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">They have the right to use them, and to allocate or licence their use to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">368 So far as resources are concerned, these are considered to belong communally to the members of the country group in whose country they are found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">Use of these resources requires the permission of the owners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">Any activity that has a potentially deleterious impact on the land is expected to result in some form of compensation for the members of the country groups with an interest in the relevant area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">A typical example was said to be the funding made available as a result of the building by the Australian Army of the bridge over the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">369 A concomitant of the right to use the land is the duty to protect it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">Protecting the land is seen as a way of protecting oneself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">The authors say that the ability to discharge that duty has been facilitated, in recent years, by Territory and Commonwealth legislation regarding the safeguarding of sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">Similarly, although the protection of places is important, there is also a separate requirement that areas be cared for in accordance with traditional customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">For example, it is expected that there will be regular burning off thereby ensuring that the country remains open, easy to traverse, and that food and animals can be seen, thus facilitating hunting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">I should interpolate that it is plain that burning off is a regular occurrence at Timber Creek, normally carried out at the end of the wet season.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">370 The final duty identified by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche is that of ensuring the safety of visitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">This means that strangers must be inducted into the country so that its spirituality will not harm them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">This process of induction through the ritual of head wetting has already been discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">Continuity of Connection to Country 
 
371 The final part of the joint report deals with continuity of connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">The authors conclude that the claimants have had a continuous and ongoing relationship with Makalamayi that long predates sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">372 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche state several bases for this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">They note that many of the sites that they were shown by the claimants were recorded by earlier researchers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">They refer to maps and site lists compiled for earlier land claims, and observe that these sites demonstrate a pivotal Dreaming reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">They say that the sites are more than mere places, or lists of named locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">They are to be regarded as symbolising a range of spiritual and associated imperatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">A very important part of the claimant community's culture continues to be a belief in the manifestation of Dreaming spirituality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">373 According to the report, the area around Timber Creek features three major Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">These are Dingo (Wirip), a composite of different fish including barramundi, shark, stingray and catfish, and finally a hunchback figure (Humpyback or Wuguru).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">In addition to these Dreamings, there are several localised beings, most notable of which is the Centipede, which gives its name to the particular site mentioned earlier in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">The tracks of the principal Dreamings, as they relate to the claim area, are shown in a map that is appended to the joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">374 Other sites are also significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">They include burial places, where the "old people" have been interred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">These are described as having a continuing importance, not only out of respect for the dead, common to most cultures, but because the spirits of the dead are considered still to reside there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">375 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche comment upon what they observed of the hunting and gathering in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1517">At one point, they set out various plants or other resources identified by their Nungali or Ngaliwurru names, and then discuss the current use of these products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">From this analysis, they conclude that the use and knowledge of bush resources have continued to be part of the claimants' customary beliefs and practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">In the authors' opinion, the claimants have gained their understanding and knowledge of traditional matters from their elders, through oral transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">The claimants believe that this knowledge derives ultimately from the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">They consider it to be "unchanging".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">This provides for a social context where knowledge is transmitted with some regard for continuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">376 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche see further evidence of continuity in custom and tradition in the ethnographic data that emerged in the land claims of the 1980s, and as far back as the earlier work of Professor Stanner, more than 70 years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">In the authors' own words:
 
 "We conclude two things from these propositions and data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">First the applicants assert that continuity of cultural transmission is an important aspect of the interaction between young and old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">This is demonstrated in their behaviour as well as in their comments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">Second, there is evidence, documented in the preceding paragraphs, that there is a continuity in the transmission of traditional knowledge and that this relates to normative values and rules which continue to provide the basis upon which the applicants frame their social interactions, their view of the world and the proprietorial interests in country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">" 
 

377 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche summarise their conclusions at [9.1]-[9.7] of their report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">I propose to set those paragraphs out in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">
 "In this report we have set out our understandings of how the applicant community is constituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1531">It comprises five country groups whose members consider themselves to be affiliated to named areas, which are often called 'countries'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1532">We have set down how individuals are recruited to country groups, through descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">We have indicated that, in our view, descent at Timber Creek is reckoned as cognatic, although there would appear to be some preference for claiming country via patrifiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">One possible interpretation of this is that there has been a move away from patrifiliation over the last two or three generations, presumably as a result of the major social, economic and demographic changes that have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">However, the evidence from the literature is not conclusive in relation to the universality of patrifiliation for country groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">Regardless of what the situation was prior to contact with Europeans, it is reasonable, in our view, to conclude that cognation was always a part of traditional reckonings of the descent of rights in country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">We have noted how matrifiliation was always accommodated within Aboriginal societies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">We have argued that descent is the primary principle for reckoning membership of country groups and from all the evidence available to us, this would have been the case also prior contact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1539">At Timber Creek today descent remains the first principle whereby membership of country groups is reckoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1540">
 
 Fundamental to the applicants' culture is a belief in the spirituality of the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1541">We have set out the beliefs, practices, concepts and ways of doing things which we have observed and been told about during our field work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1542">These we have identified as forming a distinctive culture that characterises the applicant community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1543">The culture we have described is believed to have been the product of the Dreaming and is considered to be inviolable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1544">That is to say, the traditional practices are considered to be the product of rules and are referenced to an ideal manner of conduct which was set out in the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1545">This is considered to be unchanging and not to be altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1546">It is, then, a normative system whereby contemporary action is predicated on an acceptance of prescriptive rules for action, inter-action, belief and practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1547">These are considered to be constant and to have their origins beyond the here and now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1548">
 
 The applicants understand themselves to be related through the spirituality of the Dreaming to the land of their forbears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1549">The five country groups are identified with five countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1550">This relationship is founded upon filiation by reference to descent and is articulated and brought to daily notice by reference to a range of activities which are underpinned by asserted spiritual connectedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1551">These include the exercise of rights and duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1552">The relationship between a man and woman and his or her country is identified (subject to the acquisition of certain knowledge) in terms of that person being an owner and a 'boss' for the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1553">It is a relationship that requires that such a person be fully acknowledged and taken into account in any dealings that eventuate with respect to that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1554">However, we have also shown how a quite complex set of relationships, some founded upon belief, some on kinship, some on other developed relationships, mean that an individual's relationship to his or her country is also mediated by relationships with others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1555">Consequently, ownership of country is neither absolute or unqualified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1556">It exists in a social context that serves to emphasise the relationship of owners and countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1557">The result, in our view, is that countries and country groups operate as sets, here identified as the applicant community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1558">It is for this reason that the applicants have chosen to put forward a claim for native title, not just as one country group, but as members in common of five.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1559">
 
 Given the complex and rich nature of the social relationships that underpin the commensality of the country groups discussed here, it appears unlikely to us that this represents an innovation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1560">It is unlikely to be the product of some form of social collapse of a society that was characterised by autonomous and hermetic patrilineal groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1561">We have shown by reference to other writers that local group autonomy has not been shown to be the case elsewhere in Aboriginal Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1562">We have also noted that traditionally the use of country required rights to a domain of country that exceeded individual estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1563">Residence groups were made up of several (or many) country groups, therefore corporately they had representatives from owners of a set of individual estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1564">
 
 The ways in which the applicants consider themselves to be owners of areas of country (which includes, but is not limited to) the application area, furnishes them with rights to that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1565">The exercise of these rights is observable in practice and includes access rights, the right to control the access of others, rights to the resources of the country, rights to the intellectual property associated with the country and the assumption of roles in ritual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1566">Exercise of these rights is hedged round with rules and requirements, which are considered to be imbedded within the applicants' culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1567">This includes certain duties with respect to the land which we have set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1568">Consistent with these understandings rights and duties are exercised by members of the applicant community in relation to their land, in differing ways, depending on their qualifications and standing in the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1569">
 
 Dreaming and spirituality are considered to be contemporary manifestations of past events during which culture was ordained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1570">The applicants believe that the Dreaming origins of their culture and the spirituality upon which their relationship to land is predicated is, then, both past and present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1571">It has its origins in the distant past in a time before imagining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1572">Knowledge of these things has been handed down from generation to generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1573">Its contemporary spirituality is a part of lived experience and cultural practices are a part of the way of life of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1574">From the applicants' perspective then, the rules, the ways of doing things and their whole cultural universe are based on ancient practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1575">They are from time immemorial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1576">
 
 We have reviewed some of the early literature which is available for the Timber Creek area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1577">We have concluded that there is insufficient material available to demonstrate conclusively from it whether the system of laws and cultural rules which we have described were those that would have been found in the community at the time of first contact with Europeans, or prior to 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1578">However, it is our view that their culture and the rules that mould it are, in all probability, based upon a traditional system that predates sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1579">Our reasons for reaching this conclusion are that the nature of the material we have presented relating to customs and rules which characterise this community are consistent with what is likely to have been traditional practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1580">In this we have cited, where possible, other ethnographic data in support of that we have presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1581">We have also shown there to be substantial correlation between our research and that presented by other research in the land claims process, up to twenty years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1582">This too would support the view that there has been a continuity of belief and custom in this community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1583">" 
 

378 In short, the key points that arise out of this summary are as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; descent is the primary principle for reckoning membership of country groups, and this has been so since before European contact;
 &#8226; descent at Timber Creek is cognatic, though there is some preference for claiming country via patrifiliation;
 &#8226; it is likely that there has been a move away from patrifiliation to cognatic descent over the past two or three generations;
 &#8226; the claimants share a belief in the spirituality of the Dreaming, and have traditional beliefs, practices, concepts and ways of doing things that render them a distinctive culture, and a homogenous community;
 &#8226; given the complexity, and rich nature of the social relationships that exist, it is unlikely that these have emerged in recent times;
 &#8226; Dreaming and spirituality are considered to be contemporary manifestations of past events during which culture was ordained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1584">Knowledge of these things has been handed down from generation to generation; and
 &#8226; though the early literature available for the Timber Creek area does not demonstrate conclusively that the system of laws and cultural rules that applies today would have been found in the community at the time of first contact, still less in 1825, it is the authors' view that the claimants' "culture and the rules that mould it are, in all probability, based upon a traditional system that predates sovereignty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1585">
 

379 As will be seen, Professor Basil Sansom, the anthropologist called by the Northern Territory, rejects many, if not all, of these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1586">THE NORTHERN TERRITORY'S ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

<sentence id="s1605">384 Professor Sansom prepared a lengthy report responding to, and critically evaluating, the report jointly prepared by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1606">What follows is simply my attempt to summarise, in broad terms, what is obviously a complex, and heavily nuanced document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1607">Introduction to the Report 
 
385 Professor Sansom commences his report by emphasising the need for applicants in native title claims to establish the extent to which "the traditions acknowledged and customs observed" by them today match those that were acknowledged and observed by their forbears at the time of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1608">He confronts, directly, the conclusions reached by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regarding the constancy, and long history of the rules of the claimants' normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1609">He characterises their conclusions as "the usual ideological position encountered in Aboriginal Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1610">Professor Sansom's use of the term "ideological", in this context, is no accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1611">He repeats that adjective on a number of occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1612">He questions whether "the expert anthropologists" (by which he means anthropologists other than Dr Palmer and Ms Asche) concur with "the ideological view" that Dr Palmer and Ms Asche put forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1613">386 According to Professor Sansom, the opinion expressed by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche that the claimants' culture, and the rules that mould it, are in all probability, based upon a system that predates sovereignty is, in truth, little more than a restatement of an "ideological" position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1614">387 Professor Sansom takes Dr Palmer and Ms Asche to task for glossing over the shift from a patrilineal system to a cognatic system, which they acknowledge has occurred, but regard as nothing more than an adaptation of an existing normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1615">Professor Sansom strongly disagrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1616">He sees that shift as reflecting a quite fundamental change to an entirely different normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1617">In other words, he sees the shift as revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, and as involving a change from one operating principle to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1618">388 Professor Sansom ascribes to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche a thesis that asserts continuity in the transmission of relevant custom and tradition from 1825 to 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1619">In his own terms:
 
 "The experts [Palmer and Asche] seem to hold that there have been 179 years of stasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1620">" 
 

389 Professor Sansom acknowledges the depth of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche's research, noting that they:
 
 "have not, in general, neglected publications that pertain to the matters of anthropology and ethnography that have a bearing on Tennant Creek [sic]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1621">
 

390 Indeed, he acknowledges that his own report relies, to a great extent, upon the same materials as are listed in the bibliography to the report prepared by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1622">He adds, however, that he has had regard to several sources that were not available to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1623">He says that he regards these additional sources as important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1624">391 Professor Sansom's interpretation of the anthropological literature differs somewhat from that of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1625">He concludes that there have been significant "shifts and changes in customary practice and traditions" in the region about Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1626">If his conclusion regarding this matter were to be accepted, the claimants' case would be detrimentally affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1627">Shifts in Customary or Traditional Practice 
 
392 Professor Sansom identifies two major shifts in customary or traditional practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1628">He says that these shifts bear directly upon the ways in which members of the claimant community assert rights and interests in land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1629">In his opinion:
 
 
 &#8226; there has been a shift from patrilineal inheritance to cognation as the basis for "taking country"; and
 &#8226; there has been a shift from the position whereby each separate language group (or "tribe") in the region of Timber Creek was associated with a distinct territory of its own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1630">There has been a merger between two language groups, Ngaliwurru and Nungali, and a concomitant combination of what has traditionally been two separate and distinct language countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1631">This merger was accompanied by an amalgamation of territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1632">The merger was part and parcel of a general amalgamation in which land and people, and ways of speaking, had combined to provide a new and inclusive social and political identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1633">
 

393 Professor Sansom sees these shifts as "far reaching", and as having significant legal implications when the Court comes to consider the "community of native title holders" and the continuity of principles for recruitment of persons to this group over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1634">394 As Professor Sansom notes, the notion that there has been a shift from a patrilineal system to a cognatic system at Timber Creek is not new.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1635">This very proposition was canvassed at length before Commissioner Maurice during the course of the Timber Creek Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1636">The Commissioner concluded that the system that operated in 1985 was not simply to be described as cognatic, but rather one that was in the course of adaptation from a system that had been patrilineal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1637">395 As previously indicated, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard the kinship system that presently operates in and around Timber Creek as being almost, though not quite, unambiguously cognatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1638">The one qualification that they are prepared to make is that there appears to be some preference, on the part of the inhabitants, for claiming country via patrifiliation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1639">Professor Sansom regards that "preference", as characterised by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, as the last vestige of traditional patriliny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1640">396 Professor Sansom criticises Dr Palmer and Ms Asche for having elided a distinction between cognation as always having been a part of traditional reckonings (a proposition that he accepts might be true), and their contention that the kinship system at Timber Creek had always been cognatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1641">That latter contention he rejects entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1642">In Professor Sansom's view, the system of kinship that prevailed at Timber Creek at the time of sovereignty was patrilineal, nothing more and nothing less.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1643">He says that that system has radically altered over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1644">397 Throughout the balance of his report, Professor Sansom documents the shift to cognation, and offers various explanations for that shift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1645">He argues that the shift is occurring "very generally" in the "Top End" and, more particularly, that it is commonly encountered in the central-north region in which Timber Creek is located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1646">He maintains that the principle of patrilineal descent has gradually been eroded, and that cognation has given rise to a new set of norms that destroy continuity and connection with tradition and custom relating to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1647">Oral Tradition 
 
398 Professor Sansom is highly sceptical of the extent to which aboriginal recall can be relied upon as an accurate basis for drawing historical conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1648">He cautions against what he describes as Dr Palmer and Ms Asche's use of the "ethnographic present".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1649">By that, he means a tendency to assume that what is observed at any given time can readily be translated back, and projected forward, even if there is no empirical basis for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1650">He criticises anthropologists who present accounts of normative systems that are "self-sustaining and self-perpetuating".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1651">He is particularly critical of Professor Rose's interpretation of the cultural system of Yarralin people (upon which Dr Palmer and Ms Asche place great reliance) for just this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1652">A Diachronic Analysis 
 
399 Professor Sansom observes that the claimants' case must be assessed, at least from an anthropological point of view, on the basis of a "diachronic" rather than a "synchronic" analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1653">It appears that the notion of a "diachronic" analysis derives from an essay written by Professor L&eacute;vi-Stauss, the celebrated anthropologist, in 1953.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1654">By "diachronic" Professor Sansom means something akin to "historical", with the additional gloss being that diachronic studies are those concerned with the alteration of systems of action and systems of norms from one identifiable state to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1655">To produce a diachronic analysis the anthropologist usually proceeds by comparing successive states of a social system as these are expressed in succeeding moments of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1656">400 Professor Sansom's view, in relation to a diachronic analysis of Timber Creek, is that there are three main moments for comparison:
 
 
 &#8226; Professor Stanner's survey (1934-5);
 &#8226; Timber Creek Land Claim (1985, Commissioner Maurice); and 
 &#8226; Professor Rose on Yarralin (1992).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1657">
 

401 Professor Sansom argues that a careful study of these three "moments" yields a story of progressive shifts in practice which, over time, become normative in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1658">In other words, in his opinion, a statistical shift, once manifest, leads ultimately to a normative shift, or a change in the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1659">402 The shifts that Professor Sansom discerns involve the movement from detailed, onerous and restrictive rules to more flexible, inclusive and variable rules regarding the recruitment of groupings whose members may claim entitlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1660">As he notes, in the absence of any legislative rule-making body, changes in customary rules can only come about as a result of the gradual accumulation of contrary practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1661">In other words, considerable numbers of people no longer do things in accordance with the old ways, and these "rule breakers" get away with what might previously have been characterised as "deviant practice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1662">The Myth of Eternal Recurrence 
 
403 Professor Sansom argues that any history of a normative shift of this type is likely to be suppressed and denied so that the basic, and fundamental, tenet of the Dreaming can be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1663">He describes this as the "myth of eternal recurrence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1664">In his opinion, anthropologists are likely to view the process differently from the participants in the relevant "jural community".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1665">Where those participants see continuity, the anthropologist will see change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1666">Land Claim Proceedings 
 
404 Professor Sansom warns of the danger of simply adapting anthropological evidence given in earlier land claim proceedings, under different legislative regimes, when considering a native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1667">Native title requires attention to history, and this puts the evidence given by contemporary indigenous witnesses into a particular timeframe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1668">Claims of traditional ownership in land claim proceedings lack this historical emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1669">Those claims focus heavily on concepts such as "caring for country", whereas the emphasis in native title claims is on rights and interests, in relation to land or waters, possessed under traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1670">There is also the requirement to establish that those laws and customs have a connection with the land or waters, and that those rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1671">405 It is for these reasons that Professor Sansom regards notions such as the principle of descent as central to native title claims, but merely peripheral when it comes to claims of traditional ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1672">In his terms, the discourse of "rights", which is the language of native title claims, is qualitatively different from the discourse of "responsibilities", which lies at the heart of land right claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1673">The Shift to Cognation 
 
406 Professor Sansom observes that where there is a shift from patrilineal endowment to cognation, people take country from either father, or from mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1674">He characterises this shift to cognation as an equalisation between "father-right and mother-right".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1675">He describes it as a radical modification of the composition of the local group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1676">People come to country not directly by "agnatic" inheritance, but rather by choosing among the four lines of descent that are now available at the grandparental level, or even the eight lines of descent that can be called in at the great-grandparental level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1677">407 Professor Sansom attaches to his report an appendix that is devoted to a consideration of social arrangements in the Western Desert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1678">As he notes, indigenous people in that region came to land, not on the basis of patrilineal descent, but by way of cognatic connection to ancestors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1679">He describes the Western Desert as a home to cognatic systems of kinship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1680">Moreover, he says that in the Western Desert, cognation takes what he describes as a classic form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1681">He says that in aboriginal studies, the Western Desert provides the exception to the rule that, in general, kinship in aboriginal Australia was patrilineal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1682">408 Professor Samson says that if the ancestors of the Timber Creek claimants had a cognatic kinship system in earlier times, the classic Timber Creek system would be "like that of the Western Desert".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1683">He says that in the context of the present claim, the Western Desert example could be cited in an attempt to show that cognatic kinship systems were not exceptional in aboriginal Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1684">Cognation could be presented as one of the randomly occurring varieties of aboriginal kinship, and therefore as supporting the possibility that the kinship system at Timber Creek was, as Dr Palmer and Ms Asche suggest, cognatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1685">409 Professor Sansom's thesis appears to be that at least in desert areas of great privation there is a need for greater flexibility in acquiring interests to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1686">Otherwise, tribes will simply die out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1687">However, Timber Creek is well-watered, lush and fertile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1688">It ought therefore to fall within the general picture of purely patrilineal descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1689">Professor Stanner 
 
410 For Professor Sansom, Professor Stanner is the doyen of anthropologists regarding the indigenous inhabitants of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1690">In his own words, Professor Stanner "provides essential facts" and "supplies the necessary theory".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1691">411 According to Professor Sansom, Professor Stanner's findings, based upon his contact with the people of the Victoria River region in 1934 and 1935, were straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1692">Professor Stanner concluded that they were all peoples of the patrilineal totemic clan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1693">In Professor Sansom's view, that finding remains unassailable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1694">Indeed, it is said to have been supported by Professor Stanner's later research, published in 1965, which concluded that ownership of land in aboriginal Australia vested in the "patrilineal totemic clan".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1695">412 Professor Sansom acknowledges that Professor Stanner qualified that finding by noting that the groups of people who moved about country together, and camped together at nightfall (the "hordes") were made up of people who would be drawn from several clans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1696">Each would have its own agnatic core, and would move over and exploit lands held in ownership by more than one patrilineal group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1697">413 Professor Sansom's summary of Professor Stanner's theory, is as follows:
 
 "Individuals would have access to their own clan estate by virtue of father-right which was a primary right; they gained access to other estates by virtue of secondary rights derived from kinship and affinity and, finally, land-owners could grant permission for access (whether conditional or unconditional) to the stranger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1698">" 
 

414 In other words, Professor Stanner contemplated a hierarchy of proprietary interests with patrilineal rights at the apex, but other rights derived from cognation and other sources nonetheless being recognised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1699">415 Professor Sansom is, however, critical of Professor Stanner's failure to appreciate that principles of succession could, and did, operate in the Victoria River region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1700">In circumstances where a clan dies out leaving no surviving holders of primary rights in the clan estate, persons who hold secondary rights can, by due process, succeed to that estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1701">However, they do so by succession, and not by virtue of their secondary rights per se.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1702">416 Professor Sansom also attacks Professor Stanner's knowledge and understanding of the Western Desert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1703">In that regard, it should perhaps be noted that in 1934, when Professor Stanner visited the Victoria River district, he was a young man who had recently graduated in Arts, and was undertaking post-graduate research.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1704">He was not, at that time, an experienced, or particularly well-qualified, anthropologist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1705">He could not, by then, have had any extensive contact with the indigenous inhabitants of the Victoria River district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1706">Indeed, he would have been something of a novice when it came to fieldwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1707">Nonetheless, Professor Sansom regards Professor Stanner's early work as being particularly significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1708">He prefers Professor Stanner's conclusions to those of later anthropologists (who are less deferential towards Professor Stanner).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1709">417 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche regard it as somewhat odd that Professor Sansom accords so much weight to Professor Stanner's views about the indigenous inhabitants of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1710">They point out that Professor Stanner himself conceded that he knew less about those inhabitants than he would have liked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1711">Indeed, he made it clear, in his early writings that he was disappointed with the lack of information that he was able to gather from the local inhabitants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1712">He complained repeatedly of a lack of cooperation on their part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1713">418 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, though they acknowledge the value of Professor Stanner's work, are critical of his analysis of the Ngaliwurru people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1714">They regard that analysis as cursory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1715">They are also critical of Professor Stanner's treatment of the Jaminjung which they describe as "inconclusive" and "provisional".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1716">Professor Sansom largely rejects their criticisms of Professor Stanner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1717">He regards Professor Stanner's account of the indigenous community at Timber Creek as inherently likely to be reliable because it accords generally with what he sees as the correct regional pattern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1718">419 Professor Sansom is highly critical of at least some of Professor Rose's work in this area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1719">Nonetheless, he draws upon that work, in relation to ngulu and kuning, as further support for the validity of Professor Stanner's conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1720">He also calls in aid, in support of Professor Stanner's work, the conclusions of other anthropologists who have engaged in research in parts of Australia that are somewhat removed from Timber Creek, such as East Arnhem Land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1721">The Reasons for the Shift to Cognation 
 
420 In Professor Sansom's view, the shift to cognation at Timber Creek, which he regards as having gone on for many years, was a reactive adjustment to population loss, displacement, relocation, and the "mixing" together of Aboriginal populations on an unprecedented scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1722">In addition, aboriginal people had been required to develop strategies of survival in the face of an overwhelming settler presence, and the takeover by settlers of their lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1723">421 It should be noted that the debate between Dr Palmer and Ms Asche on the one hand, and Professor Sansom on the other, regarding the importance of the shift from patrilineal descent to cognation is by no means confined to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1724">Professor Sansom has been grappling with this issue for many years, as is demonstrated by the evidence that he gave to the Land Commissioner in the Upper Daly Land Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1725">That evidence is discussed at [161]-[163] of Professor Sansom's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1726">He comments further upon this subject in connection with the Larrakia people at [164].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1727">422 Professor Sansom refers extensively to a recent work by Professor Peter Sutton, " Native Title in Australia: An Ethnographic Perspective " (2003).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1728">Professor Sutton's thesis was that the emergence of cognatic descent groups constituted an aspect of "post-classical social organisation", and represented a revised normative system of "post-classical kinship".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1729">Professor Sansom says that, with the emergence of cognatic kinships, two things tend to happen amongst previously patrilineal peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1730">First, there is a collapse of the clan structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1731">Next there is a tendency for distinctly defined estate groups to disappear, and for there to be a revision of the sacred and totemic geography of a grouping identified as a "tribe" or language-owning group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1732">Ownership comes to be claimed, not on an estate basis, but rather as ownership of a "language country" or "tribal territory".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1733">This happens because cognation diversifies and generalises interests in country, while traditional patriliny concentrates rights and interests in estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1734">423 However, having made these points, Professor Sansom does not identify any factors that might indicate that such revolutionary changes have occurred at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1735">Rather, he gives as examples of this process, Darwin and Katherine, both large towns, and vastly different in that respect to Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1736">424 Professor Sansom first presented his thesis as to why people "go cognatic" in the Upper Daly cases of the 1980s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1737">He notes that that thesis is now supported by Professor Sutton, whose own work cites extensively from Professor Sansom's earlier reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1738">425 Put simply, Professor Sansom argues that the shift to cognation around Timber Creek was brought about, at least in part, by the "killing times" which led to a dramatic reduction in the indigenous population of the area during the forty years or so after initial contact with European settlers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1739">Professor Stanner had commented upon that phenomenon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1740">Professor Rose herself estimated that, over the years, somewhere between approximately 85 and 95 per cent of the aboriginal population of the Victoria River district had been lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1741">She noted that some of this population loss had been brought about by internecine warfare among the indigenous community, while smallpox, introduced from Indonesia by Macassans prior to sovereignty, may also have had an impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1742">426 Professor Sansom concludes that the massive depletion of population suffered by the northern aborigines threatened social and human survival.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1743">Some groups were extinguished, while others survived with local social organisation much modified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1744">In many instances, this involved disappearance of the patrilineal clan as the distinctive local group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1745">427 A second factor in the shift to cognation is what Professor Rose and Mr Lewis describe as a "refuge thesis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1746">This is said to account for different death rates among the "tribes" of the Victoria River district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1747">The peoples who survived tended to be those for whom the sandstone country of their respective homelands served as a "refuge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1748">Sandstone country was inaccessible, and offered graziers no pasturage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1749">Aboriginal Genealogy and Related Matters 
 
428 Professor Sansom says that one of his aims is to document three phenomena:
 
 
 &#8226; the indigenous relegation of the past;
 &#8226; the suppression of accounts of irregularity or matters that cast doubt upon continuity and uniformity of practice; and
 &#8226; the indigenous calculation of the onset of "time immemorial".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1750">
 

429 In Professor Sansom's opinion, Aboriginal genealogies are "shallow".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1751">People tend to remember ancestors only as far back as their grandparents, or perhaps occasionally, a single great-grandparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1752">Native title proceedings are distorted by the ban on recalling the names of the dead, especially those who have died in recent times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1753">Unlike some oral cultures, there is no tradition among indigenous people of memorising lengthy genealogies, stretching back many generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1754">430 The contrast between the approach of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche to indigenous oral history, and that of Professor Sansom, could hardly be greater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1755">Dr Palmer and Ms Asche readily acknowledge that there are dangers in acting upon unsupported oral tradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1756">However, they have a very different view about what can provide such support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1757">431 Professor Sansom, on the other hand, seems to favour the consignment of oral history to the periphery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1758">As he puts it:
 
 "In the absence of total and reliable outside documentation of the history of a local group since sovereignty, it is not possible to say of any contemporary local group that it was represented by the antecedents of present members in 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1759">" 
 

432 Of course, if this statement were taken literally, no native title claim could ever succeed in the Northern Territory, or perhaps in any other part of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1760">433 Professor Sansom is perhaps on stronger ground when he outlines a number of the particular dangers associated with historical recall in evidence given by indigenous persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1761">These include the ban on calling the names of the dead, which is always respected in native title cases, the anthropologically accepted observation regarding the "shallowness" of genealogical recall in Aboriginal societies, and the operation of what he describes as the "hearsay rule".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1762">I should explain that this has nothing to do with the hearsay rule as an exclusionary rule of evidence, but rather proscribes the telling of stories about a person or persons that one has never met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1763">434 Professor Sansom argues that there exist a set of conventions that require history to be revised so as to skate over irregularities in consequential matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1764">These include succession to land, and the takeover by one tribe of the country of another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1765">He claims that this set of conventions eliminates such matters from collective memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1766">435 It is not entirely clear whether Professor Sansom, in speaking of "the manipulation of history", is ascribing to indigenous people a conscious desire to embellish the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1767">There are indications in some of his language to just that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1768">His thesis is that anything that does not fit within the template of traditional lore regarding continuity and uniformity of custom and practice, such as irregular succession to land, or immigration, or the takeover by one group of the land of another, will be expunged from the record of oral history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1769">He goes on to say that, similarly, any major shift in the rules of kinship that may have occurred will be expunged from memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1770">He claims that present day indigenous persons will assert that what is in fact a reformed kinship system is no new creation, but simply an eternal endowment of law ordained in the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1771">436 Finally Professor Sansom deals with calibrating "time immemorial".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1772">He accepts Professor Rose's proposition that aboriginal cultural conceptions yield an historical present of about 100 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1773">Anything before that is allocated to the time of the Dreamings, and is "past recall".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1774">Professor Sansom's Conclusions 
 
437 Applying his various theoretical constructs to Timber Creek, Professor Sansom argues that a number of historical shifts have been obscured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1775">First is the revision of the system of kinship and descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1776">Second is the complex merger of two previously separate language groups, their languages amalgamated, and their historically separate language countries combined into a single territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1777">In his view, inevitably, and in accordance with culturally enjoined tendency, things that are probably new developments are, and will be, characterised by indigenous witnesses as realities that have existed "from time immemorial".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1778">438 Professor Sansom's conclusions, if accepted, would cast doubt upon the existence of the native title claim group, as pleaded, and therefore upon whether there are communal native title rights and interests of the type alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1779">They would also cast doubt upon whether any rights and interests that are shown to exist are possessed under "the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed" by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1780">Finally, they would at least substantially weaken the contention that the claimants, "by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters" claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1781">DR PALMER'S REBUTTAL 
 
439 Dr Palmer received a copy of Professor Sansom's revised report on 26 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1782">Dr Palmer received that report after he had gone to Timber Creek in preparation for the on-site hearing of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1783">By that stage he had already begun his consideration of Professor Sansom's original report, which was filed in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1784">440 Dr Palmer was strongly critical of Professor Sansom's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1785">He concluded that none of the matters raised by Professor Sansom had caused him to alter any of the views that he had earlier expressed in the joint report with Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1786">However, he considered it useful to set out in greater detail than he had previously done just how much time he had spent undertaking field work in the western areas of the Top End.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1787">441 Dr Palmer pointed out that as far back as 1984 he had undertaken field work in and around Timber Creek as part of his involvement in the Timber Creek Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1788">He had met, and worked with, a number of the senior claimants in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1789">He had also become acquainted with, and worked with, other senior men and women who had since died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1790">442 At about that time, Dr Palmer had also engaged in research in relation to the Amanbigji (Kildurk) Land Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1791">That involved a pastoral lease some 130 kilometres south-west of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1792">Dr Palmer undertook field work at Amanbigji, collecting data on the laws and customs of the claimants, and recording genealogies and sites of significance in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1793">He estimated that he had spent a total of approximately thirty days engaged in that fieldwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1794">443 Between 1996 and 1998, Dr Palmer was the senior anthropological advisor for the applicants in the Miriuwung---Gajerrong native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1795">He spent about thirty days undertaking fieldwork in the Keep River National Park, located approximately 150 kilometres west of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1796">444 In 1999, Dr Palmer conducted a series of field visits to aboriginal communities in the Victoria River district as part of a regional review of outstation resource agencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1797">In 2002 and again in 2003 he provided advice to the Kimberly Land Council in relation to an anthropological report prepared for a native title claim involving land in the vicinity of the Argyle diamond mine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1798">445 The point of all this was, no doubt, to establish that, unlike Professor Sansom, Dr Palmer had spent an enormous amount of time in the Timber Creek region over many years, undertaking extensive field studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1799">He had lived and worked closely with the indigenous people of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1800">446 Dr Palmer pointed out that Professor Sansom's fieldwork had been confined to studies of urban dwelling people in the Darwin region, and an involvement in three land claims as an anthropologist assisting the Land Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1801">In none of those three claims had Professor Sansom undertaken any fieldwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1802">In Dr Palmer's terms, the criticisms levelled by Professor Sansom at the joint report that he and Ms Asche had prepared were all theoretically based, and derived from a grasp of relevant literature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1803">However, Professor Sansom had no first hand study or experience of the people living at Timber Creek, or even in any of the surrounding areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1804">447 In relation to the views of Professor Stanner regarding patrilineal descent, Dr Palmer accepted that the inhabitants of Timber Creek generally preferred to state their connection to country in patrilineal terms rather than through the matrilineal line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1805">However, he repeated his earlier view that, although links to father's country were important, it was also essential to recognise that the system of descent that applied in this area was flexible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1806">There had indeed been a shift from patrilineal to cognatic descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1807">However, in Dr Palmer's opinion, the normative system that underpinned the acquisition of rights to land in the area had not changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1808">Descent was still the key to that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1809">448 Dr Palmer appeared quite irritated by Professor Sansom's suggestion that he and Ms Asche he had in some way rejected the notion that there had been a shift from patriliny to cognation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1810">As previously noted, Professor Sansom had accused Dr Palmer and Ms Asche of believing that that there had been "179 years of stasis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1811">That charge was emphatically denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1812">All that they had said was that, in Timber Creek, recruitment to a country group was by cognation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1813">There was still a preference for patrilineal descent, whether direct or indirect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1814">It was true that in the Timber Creek Land Claim Commissioner Maurice had interpreted this shift to cognation as symptomatic of a "breakdown" of patrilineally recruited groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1815">That was a view that Dr Palmer and Ms Asche did not share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1816">449 Dr Palmer challenged Professor Sansom's view that cognation was an altogether new way of gaining "primary rights in land", and therefore represented a fundamental change in normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1817">His own opinion was that an appeal to cognation did not represent a departure from the normative system, but was, and always had been, a necessary part of that system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1818">450 While acknowledging the importance of Professor Stanner's work, Dr Palmer noted that it had generated intense academic debate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1819">It is unnecessary, for the purpose of this judgment, to refer to the many papers that Dr Palmer identified as having contributed to that debate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1820">Indeed, even Professor Sansom, one of Professor Stanner's strongest admirers, conceded that Professor Stanner had been wrong in relation to two key aspects of his work, the first relating to succession, and the second his notion that patrilineal descent operated universally throughout Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1821">Professor Sansom also acknowledged that cognation was a traditional normative principle in relation to recruitment to certain country groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1822">However, he regarded cognation as being confined to the harsh Western Desert environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1823">451 In Dr Palmer's own words, the differences between Professor Sansom and himself were largely those of emphasis and degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1824">Professor Sansom insisted upon seeing a shift to cognation as a fundamental departure from traditional norms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1825">Dr Palmer saw a shift to cognation as nothing more than a change of emphasis in a normative system that remained fundamentally the same, based as it was upon descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1826">Dr Palmer was strongly of the view that this normative system had existed since well before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1827">To his mind, calling in aid Professor Stanner could not really resolve this debate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1828">452 I will not go through the detail of all of Dr Palmer's many responses to Professor Sansom's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1829">There is one response, however, that is of particular importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1830">Dr Palmer takes strong objection to Professor Sansom's view that oral traditions that claim to establish original or traditional practices are inherently suspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1831">453 Dr Palmer acknowledges that Professor Sansom has some legitimate points to make regarding the shallowness of aboriginal genealogical recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1832">However, he points out that both he and Ms Asche were well aware of the research that had been done into this phenomenon when they prepared their joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1833">For that reason, they had carefully scrutinised the genealogical evidence that had been presented to them, and wherever possible, sought to verify it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1834">454 Dr Palmer rejected Professor Sansom's notion that much of the oral history given by the claimants in these proceedings should be rejected as a form of "revisionism".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1835">He said that the accounts that the claimants had given him and Ms Asche were at least consistent with those recorded by earlier researchers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1836">Moreover, those accounts were remarkably consistent over more than two decades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1837">Even if there was an element of "re-writing of history" as Professor Sansom suggested, this would not negate the existence of an on-going and continuous system of normative rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1838">On the contrary, such a process might support the existence of such a system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1839">It might reflect a desire by the claimants to ensure that the rules of the system were validated, despite deviations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1840">455 In Dr Palmer's own words, at [76] and [77] of his supplementary report:
 
 "The oral traditions at Timber Creek (narratives, song and ritual performances) are, in my understanding, a principal means by which owners of tracts of country assert their rights in their country ....</sentence>
<sentence id="s1841">This oral tradition is practised in the company of others who usually have senior status either in the same country that is being celebrated or in a neighbouring area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1842">In my experience, individuals are generally unwilling to talk about country without others being present to witness the account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1843">Again, in my experience, these discussions are often accompanied by an interplay between individuals which provides for a means of ensuring that accounts are correct --- that is consistent with corporate memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1844">In ritual performance, such commensuality is a significant feature of interactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1845">Without the presence of others, ritual performance could not take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1846">Oral knowledge is thus not individuated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1847">Its presentation is subject to group correction and validation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1848">Performance and transmission is regulated by a jural public, ensuring continuity of content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1849">Ritual instruction is characterised as vigorous and attention is paid to ensuring that an initiate learns fully and correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1850">'Getting to wrong' is subject to sanction and is not tolerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1851">
 
 In my view, such a process of oral tradition works toward the maintenance of continuity of accounts and limits the possibility for revisionism or innovation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1852">While oral accounts will, perhaps inevitably, suffer transmutation over time, transformation is not facilitated by the process I have here outlined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1853">In my view, Professor Sansom has somewhat overstated the case for discontinuity when the ethnography reveals robust mechanisms that work toward continuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1854">" 
 

456 Finally, Dr Palmer was strongly critical of Professor Sansom's approach to language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1855">Part of what he had to say in this regard was set out in an appendix to his supplementary report which addressed the men's restricted evidence that had been given on site on 9 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1856">It is unnecessary at this stage to say anything further about that evidence, or Dr Palmer's observations concerning it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1857">The evidence is summarised in Appendix B to the supplementary report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1858">AFANT'S EVIDENCE 
 
457 AFANT, whose only real interest in these proceedings was to ensure that its members maintained their access to the waters of the Victoria River, and the Creek, led evidence from a number of individuals, including residents of Timber Creek, and regular visitors to the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1859">The witnesses whose statements were tendered were not required for cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1860">All gave evidence concerning fishing in these waterways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1861">Some spoke of fishing in the tidal areas of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1862">Their evidence may be summarised as follows:
 
 Neville Fogarty 
 
 
 
 "I've seen most of (my) family members fishing around where I do, down at Policeman's point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1863">" 
 
 "When the river drops down from the floodwater, you might see white people flicking lures from the bank and also Aboriginals with lures and bait fishing off the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1864">" 
 
 
 
 Wayne Fogarty 
 
 
 
 "I go down to the claim area all the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1865">It doesn't matter if it's the wet season or whether it's the dry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1866">Before I go fishing I go down to Timber Creek to catch the live bait by standing on the bank and throwing in my cast net.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1867">" 
 
 "During the wet season when the river is running everyone goes upstream to Policeman's Point ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1868">Sometime I trawl up and down the river in my boat and at other times I stop and catch bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1869">I do this by pulling up alongside the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1870">I then throw the anchor out onto the bank, jump out onto the bank myself and then walk along the bank and catch the bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1871">" 
 
 "At the same time, there is always someone camped along the banks at Policeman's Point and fishing off the banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1872">During the tourist season you could almost see that every day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1873">" 
 
 "When fishing at the claim area (the Rocks or Policeman's Point) ..." 
 
 
 
 Max Pike 
 
 
 
 "... we would pull up at the banks and tie our boat to a tree, jump out and use a cast net from the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1874">" 
 
 
 
 Gavin Wright 
 
 
 
 "... or I might run my boat up on a sand bar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1875">I then jump out on the bank and throw my cast net in the water and try and catch live bait as there is big mullet up there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1876">" 
 
 "At other times, I will use Timber Creek to catch live bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1877">" 
 
 
 
 Newton Hobbs 
 
 
 
 "During the dry season I go fishing about once a month and fish off the bank ... That's right up in the application area at a point known as Policeman's Point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1878">" 
 
 "I'd either walk down to the Point or drive, stand on the bank and fish or chuck my net in the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1879">" 
 
 "When I go down to the claim area, depending on what time of year you go down, I might see four or five people fishing off the banks or from the boats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1880">During the time when the competitions are on there would be at least 20-30 people casting off the banks and others in boats along the river in the application area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1881">" 
 
 
 
 Greg Wright 
 
 
 
 "In order to catch the live bait I have to park or anchor the boat, jump out onto the bank, walk along the bank and cast our throw nets into the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1882">" 
 
 
 

458 A number of these witnesses gave evidence of fishing in the non-tidal areas of the Creek as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1883">In substance, they spoke mainly of catching bait in those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1884">They spoke of catching yabbies, also known as cherapin, by the use of pots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1885">Their evidence regarding non-tidal fishing may be summarised as follows:
 
 Wayne Fogarty 
 
 
 
 "I catch yabbies by standing on the bank with a hook and a piece of meat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1886">I then throw the cast net over them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1887">" 
 
 "I used to go down at night-time with my two sons down behind the police station with a net and catch yabbies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1888">It was something I used to do with the boys and really enjoyed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1889">It was a great time that we spent together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1890">" 
 
 
 
 Max Pike 
 
 
 
 "Sometimes I go to into the actual Timber Creek and use opera house pots which are a bait trap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1891">I just bait them up with a bit of meat and chuck them into Timber Creek just behind the homes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1892">When using the opera house pots, we'd chuck them in the river and they'd sink to the bottom of the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1893">We occasionally leave them in overnight to catch cherapin for our own food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1894">I love it because it's great fun for the kids, as the claim area of Timber Creek is within 50 metres of my house to the water's edge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1895">" 
 
 
 
 Gavin Wright 
 
 
 
 "I also go into Timber Creek to catch cherapin by using an opera house pot which sinks to the bottom of the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1896">Other times I chuck in chook pellets and spear the cherapin from the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1897">" 
 
 
 
 Newton Hobbs 
 
 
 
 "On other occasions I will also put pots in Timber Creek to catch yabbies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1898">I will leave the pots in overnight and pick them up the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1899">The yabbies I catch in Timber Creek are great to eat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1900">" 
 
 
 
 Greg Wright 
 
 
 
 "On other occasions ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1901">I go to the creek known as Timber Creek and I set dilly pots or yabby pots in the actual Timber Creek itself or go water fishing for food within Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1902">
 
 
 
 John Murden 
 
 
 
 "Quite often I will put down dilly pots into the water in Timber Creek down near the caravan park to try and catch yabbies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1903">I will do this in Timber Creek almost every time that I go and fish in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1904">" 
 
 
 
 SECRET MEN'S BUSINESS - RESTRICTED 
 
459 With the consent of all parties, orders were made that enabled the evidence of Alan Griffiths and Jerry Jones that related to "high order ritual practice" to be given on site, in closed court, at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1905">That evidence was given on 9 March 2005 in the presence of a number of male claimants, and male Court staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1906">It was recorded by a male transcript recorder, and only male counsel and solicitors were permitted to be present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1907">460 It is difficult to convey the flavour of what was said during the course of the restricted evidence without revealing the matters that required that evidence to be given in confidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1908">It is sufficient, for present purposes, to give only the broadest outline of what took place, and simply to set out the transcript references that contain the full details of what was said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1909">461 The transcript-in-confidence appears at pages 825-862.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1910">Dr Palmer later commented upon that evidence in evidence that he gave in closed court at pages 1228-1244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1911">462 In substance, the restricted evidence painted a somewhat different picture of the claimants' adherence to ceremonial and ritual practice than had previously been adduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1912">Alan Griffiths and Jerry Jones spoke mainly about initiation ceremonies ("the business"), various Dreamings (knowledge of which was confined to men), and traditional customs already discussed, such as Winan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1913">463 The Court was told of locations which women were not permitted to know anything about, and of the use of sacred objects that were secret, and kept from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1914">The Court was taken to various sites that had not been the subject of the earlier site visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1915">Evidence was given of the consequences that would befall anyone who revealed these secrets to women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1916">The various rituals and ceremonies were said to date back to the Dreamtime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1917">No objection was taken to any of this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1918">Neither Mr Griffiths nor Mr Jones was challenged, in any way, about this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1919">464 Dr Palmer said in relation to the restricted evidence that he had had personal experience of high order rituals of the type discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1920">He said that there were substantial similarities between a "second order or higher order ritual" that he had previously attended, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and the Timber Creek ceremonies that were described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1921">He commented upon the various rituals which young men went through before gaining adult status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1922">He said that there was nothing in the culture of indigenous persons that was more important than the content of the initiation ritual, and the need to keep it secret from women.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1923">465 Dr Palmer's general conclusion regarding the restricted evidence was as follows: 
 
 "The evidence... is that this ritual continues to be a very important, a central part of the religious observances of the applicants, ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1924">I'm saying it is something which is regarded as a contemporary matter and ... it has been an ongoing tradition in the claimants' understanding, of course, for as long as memory can recall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1925">" 
 

466 Dr Palmer was asked how far back, in historical terms, the various rituals and ceremonies that had been described in evidence actually went.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1926">He said that based upon the "high seriousness" that was placed on their content, and the rigour with which the oral tradition was pursued in its transmission, it was likely that there had been few changes in what took place "over a very long period of time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1927">Indeed, his opinion was that the practices that had been described had not changed significantly since well before the first white men came to this region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1928">By that, I understood him to mean that these practices dated back to before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1929">467 Dr Palmer was cross-examined regarding these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1930">However, it is fair to say that the cross-examination was largely perfunctory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1931">My firm impression was that no serious challenge was mounted to the opinions that he expressed regarding the restricted evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1932">FINDINGS OF FACT 
 
468 As previously indicated, there was no challenge to the credibility of any of the indigenous witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the claimants on site at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1933">That means that I can proceed upon the assumption that they were truthful witnesses, and that any weaknesses in their evidence stemmed from problems associated with memory or powers of narration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1934">I bear in mind, however, the possibility that there has been an element of reconstruction, albeit subconscious, in some of what they had to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1935">469 Alan Griffiths, in particular, was a most impressive witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1936">He seemed to me to be knowledgeable, and a person whose beliefs were genuine, and deeply held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1937">Much the same can be said of a number of the older claimants, including in particular Josie Jones, and her husband Jerry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1938">470 I am satisfied, on the basis of the evidence of these witnesses, supported as it is by such historical material as exists, and also by the findings of the various Land Commissioners, that the claimants in these proceedings constitute a society bound together by adherence to traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1939">I am also satisfied that the members of this claim group are relevantly linked to the claim area through ancestral ties that go back to Lamparangana, and well before his time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1940">471 I find that the members of the claim group continue to acknowledge traditional laws, and to observe traditional customs in much the same way as their ancestors did over many generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1941">I find that they continue to practise important ceremonial rites, including initiation and burial customs, in ways similar to those that were followed long ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1942">I find that they follow traditional practices regarding hunting and gathering of food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1943">I find that they maintain cultural and spiritual beliefs relating to the Dreamings associated with the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1944">I find that they share a common language, Ngaliwurru, and that Nungali is, and always was, part of that language, or that it was a dialect, spoken with a different accent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1945">I find that the practice of Winan continues, and plays an important role in their cultural and religious ties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1946">472 The Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples are an indigenous community that has traditionally been associated with one of the more remote parts of the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1947">Its history is one of privation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1948">Not surprisingly, it has not escaped the many serious social problems that afflict similar indigenous communities elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1949">473 Nonetheless, real progress has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1950">There is much to commend in the way in which the elders seek to inculcate traditional values in the younger members of this community, balancing those values against modern needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1951">Important strides have been taken, in particular, in relation to education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1952">474 It is important to guard against viewing traditional aboriginal culture, as manifested through ceremonies and other practices, through a prism that creates an idealised picture of a society that does not, and probably never has, existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1953">Professor Sansom rightly cautions against such naivety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1954">I have endeavoured to give full weight to his warning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1955">I nonetheless remain firm in my conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1956">In my view, the claimants have satisfied the requirements necessary to overcome the first of a series of hurdles that they must overcome in order to obtain a determination of native title in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1957">475 The real factual dispute in this case turns not upon the primary facts adduced through the indigenous witnesses, but rather upon what interpretation should be placed upon those facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1958">Each side relied heavily upon anthropological evidence in support of its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1959">In the end, I am required to decide, as between Dr Palmer and Ms Asche, and Professor Sansom, whose interpretation of those primary facts I prefer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1960">For the reasons that follow, I accept the evidence of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche in preference to that of Professor Sansom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1961">476 The starting point, in my view, lies in the very real advantage that both Dr Palmer and Ms Asche have over Professor Sansom, having regard to their extensive involvement with the members of the claimant group over many years, and the empirical foundations for their joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1962">Professor Sansom has had considerable experience in dealing with indigenous people in other parts of Australia, but seems to me to have had little direct involvement with those who inhabit the region around Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1963">His analysis is largely theoretical, and extrapolated from his work in other communities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1964">477 Another important advantage that Dr Palmer has over Professor Sansom is that he speaks Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1965">Professor Sansom does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1966">478 Dr Palmer and Ms Asche both struck me as highly credible witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1967">Their evidence seemed to be both intelligible, and cogent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1968">They withstood cross-examination well, and made concessions where appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1969">In particular, they seemed to me to be well aware of their duties to the Court as experts whose evidence should be given impartially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1970">479 My overall impression of Professor Sansom was also quite favourable, subject to several qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1971">He seemed to me at times to attribute to Dr Palmer and Ms Asche views that they plainly did not hold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1972">This may have been because he had not considered their report as carefully as he might have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1973">480 I was troubled by Professor Sansom's repeated references to the system of descent that developed in the Western Desert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1974">That system, essentially cognatic in nature, may have resulted from the need to adapt to the rigours of perhaps the harshest environment in Australia, as he suggests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1975">However, it does not follow that elements of cognation within a broadly patrilineal system did not also exist at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1976">It should also be noted that there may be other features of traditional law and custom that are peculiar to the Western Desert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1977">For example, in Jango v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 318 , Sackville J rejected a native title claim over land in that region, largely on the basis that the claimants failed to articulate their case in a manner congruent with the evidence they presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1978">His Honour commented that the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert recognised that in certain circumstances a person could become a member of a local group, normally consisting of people recruited on the basis of common patrilineal descent, simply by being born at a place of significance to the group, at least where the person's claim was acknowledge or accepted by other members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1979">No evidence of that kind was led before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1980">481 In my view, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche are justified in their criticism of Professor Sansom for according undue deference to the early work of Professor Stanner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1981">As Professor Stanner himself observed, his research was significantly hampered by a lack of cooperation on the part of white station owners in the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1982">Moreover, Professor Stanner's methodology in 1934 and 1935 appears from his notes to have been essentially to work from a central location, using paid informants as the basis of his findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1983">It is known, for example, that the maps that he prepared were drawn on the basis of what he was told, rather than on the basis of what he observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1984">482 I also have difficulties with Professor Sansom's repeated references, in his report, to work that he had previously carried out in parts of Australia far removed from Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1985">For example, he frequently cites his report regarding Humpty Doo, in 1974.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1986">That concerned a land claim not far from Darwin, near the East Alligator River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1987">He regards the analysis adopted in that report as being applicable to the indigenous community at Yarralin, though it is not clear to me why that should be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1988">He then further extrapolates from his postulates at Yarralin to a possible scenario at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1989">That further step also needs to be justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1990">483 Professor Sansom's scepticism regarding the reliability of indigenous oral history (which he describes at one point as "the revisionist treatment of history that belongs to Aboriginal Australia") constitutes a serious attack upon what inferences might properly be drawn in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1991">His contention is that oral history is essentially worthless (unless it is supported by contemporaneous records, necessarily produced by Europeans, or at least by anthropological findings).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1992">If that contention were to be accepted, there would be little point in bringing native title determination applications in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1993">Paradoxically, it is in the Northern Territory (where European settlement took place much later than it did in other parts of Australia, and where the impact of that settlement was mostly confined to contact with pastoralists) that the prospects of claimants being able to establish a continuous connection with the land, of the kind required by the NT Act , ought to be greatest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1994">484 In my view, Dr Palmer and Ms Asche are also justifiably critical of Professor Sansom for overstating the weaknesses of oral tradition in indigenous culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1995">The fact that the members of an indigenous community all adhere to the same basic tradition, and observe customs passed on to them by their forbears, is, of itself, significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1996">It tends to suggest continuity and long-standing connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1997">In appropriate circumstances, as where narrative is memorised in song, and therefore passed on from one generation to another largely verbatim, or where "photographs" in the form of drawings exist, a court will be entitled to infer that oral tradition is both long-standing, and, within limits, reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1998">485 Professor Sansom's largely dismissive treatment of oral tradition is not supported by any data, in the evidence before me, apart from his own assertions, and some references to other anthropological writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1999">To allege that the indigenous claimants who gave evidence before me had "righteously edited and manipulated" their oral histories, in circumstances where no such suggestion was ever put to them by counsel for the Northern Territory, seems to me to have been inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2000">486 I note that Professor Sansom did not give evidence in closed court regarding the restricted evidence that was led before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2001">487 Dr Palmer, in particular, was an impressive witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2002">His evidence regarding the matters discussed in confidential session was powerful, and carried with it particular conviction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2003">488 That is not to say that I agree with everything that Dr Palmer and Ms Asche say in the joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2004">As will be seen, there are parts of that report that are not supported by the evidence, and that I reject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2005">489 It may be convenient, at this point, to set out my findings regarding the restricted evidence led before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2006">490 I am satisfied that the restricted evidence supports my conclusion that ritual observances continue to be an important part of adult life experiences among the claimants in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2007">491 I find that their spiritual beliefs are both genuine and deeply held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2008">Those beliefs and associated ritual observances provide a means whereby senior men, in particular, assert their rights to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2009">Ritual induction and subsequent ritual instruction provide a means whereby younger men are educated by their elders in spiritual matters, thereby ensuring continuity of belief and custom over generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2010">492 It is obvious that I cannot go into detail regarding the nature of the higher order ritual practice that was the subject of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2011">It has a secret name that is set out in the transcript of that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2012">It also involves elaborate features that cannot be discussed here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2013">There are secret locations associated with the practices that are described, and these are conveniently set out in the restricted submission on this subject filed on behalf of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2014">I infer that this submission was prepared by Dr Palmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2015">493 I find, on the basis of the restricted evidence, that the spiritual beliefs and religious observances of the claimants remain vibrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2016">Mr Griffiths' sons and grandsons and Mr Jones' sons have either been inducted into the high order ritual, or soon will be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2017">Aspects of that ritual have been passed on to the present generation of older men at least from the time of Lamparangana, and I infer, from well before that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2018">494 I also accept that the oral tradition that was the subject of restricted evidence before me is subject to stringent rules for its transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2019">This reduces the potential for transformation, and ensures the continuity of the normative system that it represents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2020">495 I conclude that Mr Griffiths is regarded by the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples as a leading figure in Timber Creek in matters of ritual and ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2021">The evidence establishes that in that area, local proprietorial interests determine what a man may legitimately do in the performance of such ritual and ceremonial matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2022">I find that there is a normative system in place in relation to those matters, and that substantially the same normative system has existed for generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2023">Mr Griffiths described this as "our law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2024">I am content to accept that as an accurate description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2025">496 I find that the restricted evidence, in particular, points to a link between the symbols of the higher order ritual, and proprietary interests in land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2026">The rituals and ceremonies signal a right to a country which stems from the Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2027">There is in place, in Timber Creek, a system of normative rules that governs a continuing ritual tradition which articulates an "owner's" rights to country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2028">In essence, these rights pass through descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2029">The laws and customs upon which this normative system rests are part of a conservative oral tradition that would be unlikely to be amenable to significant change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2030">497 I note that Mr Griffiths gave evidence about the abundance of Dreamings in his country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2031">Each site was said to have its own "photograph" and each was different, even though it might be associated with the same Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2032">Each Dreaming was related to a site through narrative, song and body design and other ritual attributes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2033">In Dr Palmer's view there was nothing to suggest that such an arrangement had not been in place for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2034">He believed that it long predated sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2035">I accept his evidence on that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2036">498 I note that it was submitted on behalf of the Northern Territory that the restricted evidence in fact supported some of Professor Sansom's opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2037">The central point was that patrilineal descent was an important feature of traditional custom in this region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2038">This was said to be in stark contrast with the asserted liberal cognatic rules that now apply with respect to the transmission of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2039">It was submitted that this issue had been obfuscated by the claimants, and that a disjunction between the spiritual and the secular, through the "shift to cognation", as found by Professor Sansom, could be discerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2040">499 It was also submitted on behalf of the Northern Territory that the restricted evidence provided some support for the contention that Winan was not a right or interest in relation to land for the purposes of s 223(1) of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2041">500 I am puzzled by these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2042">They do not seem to me accurately to reflect the content of the evidence led in restricted session.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2043">In my view, that evidence provided powerful support for the claimants' case in almost all its aspects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2044">I see no disjunction of the kind described in Professor Sansom's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2045">Rather, I see a deeply felt and long standing commitment on the part of the claimants to traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2046">These laws and customs have the closest possible connection to "country", and are tied geographically to the very land that is the subject of this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2047">501 In short, I reject the notion that there has been a fundamental change in the normative system that governs rights to "country" in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2048">I find that there has been a gradual shift from a patrilineal to a cognatic system, and that this shift continues today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2049">However, the crucial point is that rights to "country" in Timber Creek are and always have been based upon principles of descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2050">The shift to cognation is one of emphasis and degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2051">It is not a revolutionary change, giving rise to a new normative system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2052">NATIVE TITLE --- GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
 
502 The judgment of the Full Court in Alyawarr , to which I have already referred, contains a helpful discussion of recent developments in the law of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2053">As the Full Court observed (at [61]-[93]), the primary questions to be decided upon an application for a native title determination are:
 
 
 &#8226; whether or not native title exists in relation to a particular area; 
 &#8226; if so, who holds that title; and 
 &#8226; what is the nature and extent of the rights and interests in relation to that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2054">
 

503 A useful starting point, when considering the first of these questions may be the Preamble to the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2055">It sets out the considerations that the Commonwealth Parliament took into account in enacting the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2056">These include:
 
 
 &#8226; the acknowledgement of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People as the original inhabitants of Australia before European settlement; 
 
 
 &#8226; their dispossession of their lands, largely without compensation; and &#8226; their comprehensive social disadvantage in Australian society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2057">

504 The Preamble declares that the NT Act was intended to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the "special measures" it contained, and to ensure that indigenous people receive the full recognition and status within this nation to which their history, prior rights and interests and rich and diverse culture entitle them to aspire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2058">505 In Alyawarr the Full Court said (at [63]):
 
 "The Preamble declares the moral foundation upon which the NT Act rests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2059">It makes explicit the legislative intention to recognise, support and protect native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2060">That moral foundation and that intention stand despite the inclusion in the NT Act of substantive provisions, which are adverse to native title rights and interests and provide for their extinguishment, permanent and temporary, for the validation of past acts and for the authorisation of future acts affecting native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2061">The first of the main objects of the NT Act set out in s 3(a) is: 
 
 "... to provide for the recognition and protection of native title;" 
 
 The overview of the NT Act , in s 4(1) states: 
 
 
 
 "This Act recognises and protects native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2062">It provides that native title cannot be extinguished contrary to the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2063">" 
 
 

506 The Full Court went on to say (at [64]):
 
 "The idea of recognition is central to the common law of native title and of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2064">The common law and the NT Act define the circumstances in which recognition will be accorded to native title rights and interests and the conditions upon which it will be withheld or withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2065">It is a concept which operates in a universe of legal discourse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2066">It derives from the human act by which one people recognises and thereby respects another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2067">By the process, which it names, aspects of an indigenous society's relationship to land and waters are translated into a set of rights and interests existing under non-indigenous laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2068">The choice of the term "recognition" links it to the normative framework established by the common law and by the Act itself as evidenced in the Preamble.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2069">Recognition is not a process which has any transforming effect upon traditional laws and customs or the rights and interests to which, in their own terms, they give rise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2070">The term "extinguishment" merely refers to the withholding or withdrawal of recognition of native title rights and interests where the exercise of non-indigenous sovereignty is reflected in legislative or executive acts inconsistent with such recognition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2071">Extinguishment, like recognition, is silent on the rights and interests which arise under traditional law and custom and the relationship which they may reflect between an indigenous society and its country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2072">" 
 

507 The judgment of the Full Court then provides (at [66]), a useful summary of the rules which govern the recognition of native title rights and interests at common law, as formulated in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1 (" Mabo (No 2) "): 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2073">The colonisation of Australia by Great Britain did not extinguish rights and interests in land held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people according to their own law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2074">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2075">The native title of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under their law and custom will be recognised by the common law of Australia and can be protected under that law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2076">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2077">When the Crown acquired each of the Australian colonies it acquired sovereignty over the land within them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2078">In the exercise of that sovereignty native title could be extinguished by laws or executive grants that indicated a plain and clear intention to do so --- eg, grants of freehold title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2079">
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2080">To secure the recognition of native title it is necessary to show that the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group said to hold the native title: 
 (a) has a continuing connection with the land in question and the rights and interests in the land under Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander traditional law and custom, as the case may be; and 
 (b) continues to observe laws and customs which define the ownership of rights and interests in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2081">
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2082">Under common law, native title has the following characteristics: 
 (a) it is communal in character although it may give rise to individual rights; 
 (b) it cannot be bought or sold but can be surrendered to the Crown; 
 (c) it may be transmitted from one group to another according to traditional law and customs; 
 (d) the traditional law and custom under which native title arises can change over time and in response to historical circumstances; 
 (e) native title is subject to existing valid laws and rights created under such laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2083">" 
 
 

508 In Commonwealth v Yarmirr [2001] HCA 56 ; (2001) 208 CLR 1 at [7] (" Yarmirr "), in Ward HC at [16] and [25], and in Yorta Yorta at [32], the High Court held that, when determining a native title claim, attention must focus upon the statutory definition of "native title" and "native title rights and interests", in ss 223(1)(a) and (b) rather than the language used by Brennan J in Mabo (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2084">That is so notwithstanding the fact that those paragraphs were plainly based upon his Honour's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2085">509 In Yarmirr , s 223(1) was broken up into its component parts, and was said to require the rights and interests claimed under the NT Act to meet three requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2086">It is worth repeating those requirements:
 
 
 &#8226; they must be possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the people concerned;
 &#8226; the people, by those laws and customs, must have a "connection" with the land or waters; and
 &#8226; the rights and interests must be recognised by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2087">
 

510 In Ward HC, the High Court observed that s 223(1)(b) required consideration of whether, by the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the peoples concerned, they had a "connection" with the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2088">In other words, there had to be first an identification of the traditional laws and customs, and next a characterisation of the effect of those laws and customs as constituting a "connection" of the peoples with the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2089">511 In Alyawarr the Full Court referred to Ward HC at some length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2090">The Full Court said (at [73]):
 
 "It also emerges from their Honours' judgment that while the use to which land or waters are put may indicate the kind of connection that exists under traditional law or custom between Aboriginal peoples and the land or waters concerned, the absence of evidence of recent use does not lead necessarily to the conclusion that there can be no relevant connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2091">That depends upon the content of the traditional law and custom and what is meant by "connection" by those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2092">As to that, their Honours expressed no view on the nature of the connection that must be shown to exist or when a "spiritual connection" would suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2093">" 
 

512 The Full Court then summarised the effect of Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2094">It said (at [74]-[77]):
 
 "In Yorta Yorta the centrality of the statutory definition of native title rights and interests and "determination of native title" was emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2095">A determination under the NT Act was said to be "a creature of that Act, not the common law" (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [32]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2096">Three characteristics of native title rights and interests which can be the subject of a determination under the NT Act were stated thus: 
 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2097">They must be possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the people concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2098">That is they must find their source in traditional law and custom, not in the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2099">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2100">The rights and interests must have the characteristic that by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples, those people have a "connection with" the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2101">The source of the connection is traditional law and custom, not the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2102">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2103">The rights and interests in relation to land must be recognised by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2104">
 
 
 
 
 The traditional laws or customs which are the source of the native title rights and interests must have a "normative content".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2105">They must derive "from a body of norms or normative system - the body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty" ( Yorta Yorta at [38]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2106">This does not require fine distinctions to be drawn between legal rules and moral obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2107">The interests may arise under both law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2108">There nevertheless must be some kind of "rules" which have a "normative content".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2109">Absent such rules there may merely be observable behaviour patterns but no rights or interests in relation to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2110">
 
 In order to be cognisable by the common law any rights and interests in the land must have their origin in the system of traditional law and custom in existence at the time of the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2111">After sovereignty that system of traditional law and custom could not validly create new rights or interests cognisable by the common law ( Yorta Yorta at [43]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2112">That does not prevent the recognition of rights and interests transmitted according to rules of transmission which existed at sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2113">Nor does it prevent the significant adaptation of traditional law and custom post-sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2114">The joint judgment in Yorta Yorta required that (at [46]): 
 
 
 
 the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2115">
 
 
 
 The normative system must have had "a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty" (at [47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2116">Any interregnum in its existence would cause the rights and interests derived from it to cease beyond revival in the eyes of the common law (at [47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2117">
 The laws and customs, from which the native title rights and interests derive their existence, must necessarily be those of a society or group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2118">This proposition was derived from the general observation of Professor Honore that "all laws are laws of a society or group" ([49]-[50]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2119">It followed that the rights and interests possessed under a body of laws and customs are the creatures of the laws and customs of a particular society that exists as a group which acknowledges and observes them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2120">If that society ceases to exist so too do the laws and customs which it observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2121">When a society that existed at sovereignty ceases to exist and its laws and customs are adopted post-sovereignty by some new society the rights and interests to which they give rise would not be rooted in post-sovereignty laws and customs ([52] and [55]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2122">The Court said (at [55]): 
 
 
 
 laws and customs and the society which acknowledges and observes them are inextricably interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2123">
 
 
 
 The consequence of these considerations is that the inquiry in relation to native title rights and interests under s 223 requires consideration of the relationship between traditional laws and customs now acknowledged and observed and those which were acknowledged and observed at the time of the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2124">It must be shown that the society under whose laws and customs the native title rights and interests are said to be possessed has continued to exist from sovereignty to the present day "as a body united by its acknowledgment and observance of the laws and customs" (at [89]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2125">However, change or adaptation in traditional law and custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights is not necessarily fatal to that continuity (at [83]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2126">" 
 

513 In Alyawarr the Full Court next turned its attention to s 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2127">It observed that this section required consideration of whether the persons said to be native title holders were members of a society or community that had existed from sovereignty to the present time as a group, united by its acknowledgement of the laws and customs under which the native title rights and interests claimed were said to be possessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2128">This involved two separate inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2129">The first was whether such a society existed today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2130">The second was whether it had existed since sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2131">The judgment of the Full Court continued (at [78]):
 
 "The concept of a "society" in existence since sovereignty as the repository of traditional laws and customs in existence since that time derives from the reasoning in Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2132">The relevant ordinary meaning of society is "a body of people forming a community or living under the same government" - Shorter Oxford English Dictionary .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2133">It does not require arcane construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2134">It is not a word which appears in the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2135">It is a conceptual tool for use in its application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2136">It does not introduce, into the judgments required by the NT Act , technical, jurisprudential or social scientific criteria for the classification of groups or aggregations of people as "societies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2137">The introduction of such elements would potentially involve the application of criteria for the determination of native title rights and interests foreign to the language of the NT Act and confining its application in a way not warranted by its language or stated purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2138">" 
 

514 As the Full Court observed, a number of native title claims have focussed attention upon the rights and interests of members of different groups, sometimes in competition with each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2139">On occasion, as in Yarmirr these are described as "estate groups", though it is recognised that they are linked by ancestral connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2140">At other times they are described as "language groups".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2141">See for example Wandarang People v Northern Territory [2000] FCA 923 ; (2000) 104 FCR 380, and Neowarra v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 (" Neowarra ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2142">515 There have been cases where separate groups have asserted traditional rights in respect of discrete areas of land and sea, though perceiving themselves to be part of a broader community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2143">Sometimes, as in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2004] FCA 298 , native title has been found to exist severally, in each of the groups identified in respect of discrete defined areas of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2144">On other occasions there have been native title determinations in favour of a composite community of estate holding, or language groups with appropriate territorial, economic and social links; see for example Ward v Western Australia (1998) 159 ALR 483 (" Ward first instance"), Daniel v State of Western Australia (No 2) [2003] FCA 1425 , Neowarra, and Alyawarr itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2145">516 The final point of general principle to be considered at this stage is the requirement pursuant to s 223(1)(b) that the native title holders, by their traditional laws and customs, have a "connection" with the land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2146">517 In Alyawarr the Full Court observed (at [87]-[93]):
 
 "It is a requirement of s 223(1)(b) that the native title holders, by their traditional laws and customs, gave a "connection" with the land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2147">That requirement operates in two ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2148">It declares, as a condition of the existence of native title rights and interests under the NT Act , that their putative holders have "a connection with the land or waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2149">It also requires that the connection be "by" the traditional laws and customs under which the claimed rights and interests are possessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2150">The drafting is opaque because the word "connection" is taken from a judgment and appears to have been applied in the statute somewhat out of context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2151">It comes from the judgment of Brennan J in Mabo (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2152">The word appeared in his Honour's judgment at 59, when he referred to the fact that since European settlement of Australia many clans or groups of indigenous people had been "physically separated from their traditional land and have lost their connexion with it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2153">This is consistent with a view of connection as something wider than physical presence on the land, albeit loss of connection could be a consequence of physical separation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2154">His Honour went on to say (at 59-60): 
 
 
 
 
 Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws (and so far as practicable) to observe the customs based on the traditions of that clan or group, whereby their traditional connexion with the land has been substantially maintained, the traditional community title of that clan or group can be said to remain in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2155">
 
 
 
 His Honour contrasted that situation with the case in which "the tide of history has washed away any real acknowledgment of traditional law and any real observance of traditional customs the foundation of native title has disappeared".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2156">
 
 From the preceding it can be seen that "connection" is descriptive of the relationship to the land and waters which is, in effect, declared or asserted by the acknowledgment of laws and observance of customs which concern the land and waters in various ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2157">To observe laws and acknowledge customs which tell the stories of the land and define the rules for its protection and use in ways spiritual and material is to keep the relevant connection to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2158">There is inescapably an element of continuity involved which derives from the necessary character of the relevant laws and customs as "traditional".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2159">The acknowledgment and observance, and thereby the connection, is not transient but continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2160">
 
 The joint judgment of the majority in Ward HC at [64] observed that s 223(1)(b) requires consideration of whether, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, they had a "connection" with the land or waters: 
 
 
 
 That is, it requires first an identification of the content of the traditional laws and customs and, secondly, the characterisation of the effect of those laws and customs as constituting a "connection" of the people with the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2161">
 
 
 
 While evidence of uses might say something about connection, "absence of evidence of some recent use ... does not, of itself require the conclusion that there can be no relevant connection".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2162">The question of what is meant by "connection" by traditional laws and customs was not the subject of submissions in Ward HC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2163">The majority therefore expressed no view on the nature of connection and in particular whether a spiritual connection would suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2164">
 
 
 
 
 
 In Yorta Yorta , in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ, emphasis was placed upon the need to consider the present possession of rights and interests and the present connection of claimants with the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2165">But that was not to say that continuity of the chain of possession and continuity of connection was irrelevant: [85].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2166">
 
 
 
 
 
 The "connection" requirement of s 223(1)(b) of the NT Act was recently referred to by the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2167">Their Honours relied upon the passage cited earlier from [64] of the joint judgment in Ward HC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2168">They identified the content of the traditional laws and customs on the evidence before them which included rights and obligations relating to the use of the land in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2169">They said (at [113]): 
 
 
 
 In view of these findings as to the content of the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc, the effect of those laws and customs is, in our opinion, plainly to constitute a "connection" between Peter De Rose ... and the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2170">The traditional laws and customs confer rights and responsibilities on Peter De Rose over the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2171">They establish that he is inextricably linked to his country in a variety of ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2172">The "connection" required to satisfy s 223(1)(b) of the NTA is present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2173">
 
 
 
 
 It may be that not enough emphasis has been placed on the idea of continuity of observance as a manifestation of connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2174">The usage in Mabo (No 2) can constitute extrinsic material to aid in the construction of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2175">The use of "connection" as emphasising a requirement to show continuity of association with the land by observance and acknowledgment of traditional law and custom relating to it gives proper recognition to its origins in the Mabo judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2176">It involves the continuing assertion by the group of its traditional relationship to the country defined by its laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2177">This relationship may be evidenced by its physical presence there but also in other ways involving the maintenance of the stories and allocation of responsibilities and rights in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2178">
 
 
 
 
 
 The word "connection" should not be taken as qualifying or limiting the range of rights and interests arising under traditional law and custom which are native title rights and interests for the purposes of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2179">The existence of connection, in the sense explained, is a condition of their existence for the purposes of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2180">It does not limit their content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2181">Their content is limited by the requirement that they be rights and interests "in relation to land or waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2182">The words "in relation to" are words of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2183">The content of native title rights and interests may also be limited by the requirement, imposed by s 223(1)(c) that they "are recognised by the common law of native title".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2184">" 
 

518 Before turning to the application of these statements of principle to the facts of the present case, some background to the NT Act may be helpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2185">BACKGROUND TO THE NT ACT 
 
519 The common law of Australia has, since Mabo (No 2) , recognised a form of native title which, in cases where it has not been extinguished, reflects the entitlement of indigenous inhabitants, in accordance with their laws and customs, to their traditional lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2186">520 The NT Act in its present form was, of course, enacted largely as a response to the decision of the High Court in Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1 (" Wik ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2187">In that case the High Court held that the grant of pastoral leases in Queensland did not "necessarily extinguish all incidents of Aboriginal title".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2188">The significance of that decision went far beyond the question of the relationship of pastoral leases to native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2189">It had profound implications for the concept of native title, and the notion of extinguishment generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2190">521 The leases under consideration in Wik were all located in far north Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2191">Use of the land was limited to pastoral purposes only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2192">There were no express reservations in favour of Aboriginal people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2193">The importance of the decision lay in the criteria of extinguishment declared applicable to all forms of extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2194">The majority (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) stressed the need for a clear and plain intention in order to extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2195">This requirement was seen as simply an application of the more general rule whereby there was a presumption against expropriation of existing rights, especially without compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2196">In other words, native title was regarded as being protected by universal principles relating to the respect to be accorded to property rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2197">Native title could not be extinguished without a manifestation of unequivocal intent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2198">In order to manifest such an intent, there would have to be an inconsistency between the native title rights and the rights of the grantee, of such a stark nature, that those rights could not co-exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2199">522 The dissentients in Wik , Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ, rejected this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2200">Brennan CJ stated (at 86) that:
 
 "it would erroneous, after identifying the relevant act as the grant of a pastoral lease ... to enquire whether the grant of the lease exhibited a clear and plain intention to extinguish native title".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2201">
 

523 His Honour did not explain what degree of inconsistency would result in extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2202">However, he did observe that a finding of exclusive possession would give rise to such inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2203">524 The majority in Wik viewed pastoral leases as having created only the rights and obligations contemplated by the legislation under which they were granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2204">Accordingly, they rejected any notion that a pastoral lease could be equated with a common law leasehold interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2205">The minority, however, regarded the use in a statute of a term such as "lease", that had acquired a technical legal meaning, as prima facie evidence that the legislature intended the rights conferred under that instrument to bear that meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2206">Thus, a pastoral lease would normally be regarded as conferring a right to "exclusive possession".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2207">Such a right was manifestly inconsistent with native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2208">525 Much of the reasoning in Wik is now of historical interest only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2209">It has been overtaken by the enactment of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2210">That Act came into effect on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2211">It amended the NT Act , with a view to validating certain grants, providing certainty for pastoralists and confirming the extinguishment of native title by freehold and most leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2212">Regrettably, it has also rendered the NT Act , already highly complex in its original form, extraordinarily difficult to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2213">526 The NT Act in its present form deals with the past extinguishment of native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2214">It provides for the validation of all grants made between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996 (when judgment in Wik was handed down) over land which was formerly the subject of a freehold estate or any lease, including pastoral leases, but excluding mining leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2215">This validation would, in most cases, extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2216">It was justified on the basis that, prior to Wik , it was always assumed that native title had been extinguished by pastoral leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2217">527 However, no such assumption could be made in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2218">Pastoral leases granted in that State differed from those in other parts of the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2219">For example, they generally contained an express reservation in favour of the rights of indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2220">528 Division 2B of the NT Act is founded upon a distinction between "exclusive possession" and "non-exclusive possession" acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2221">The adoption of exclusive possession as a criterion of extinguishment was criticised in both Wik and Ward HC as "obscuring" the central issue regarding extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2222">529 In Ward HC, the requirement of a "clear and plain" legislative intention to extinguish native title, favoured in Wik, was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2223">The test under the NT Act in its present form was said to be whether rights granted to third parties are inconsistent with native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2224">This entails "an objective inquiry which requires identification of and comparison between the two sets of rights", and rejects the notion that there can be degrees of inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2225">530 In the language of the joint judgment (at [82]) it was:
 
 "... a false premise, that there can be degrees of inconsistency of rights, only some of which can be described as "total", "fundamental" or "absolute".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2226">Two rights are inconsistent or they are not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2227">If they are inconsistent, there will be extinguishment to the extent of the inconsistency; if they are not, there will not be extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2228">..." 
 

531 As previously noted, Ward HC makes it clear that the starting point when determining a native title claim under the NT Act is the Act itself, and not the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2229">To that extent, both Mabo (No 2) and Wik have become sidelined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2230">The only present relevance of those decisions is the light they cast upon the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2231">532 However, it must be remembered that one of the elements of a valid claim to native title under s 223(1) is that the rights and interests be "recognised by the common law of Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2232">Nonetheless, native title does not originate from the common law: Fejo v Northern Territory [1998] HCA 58 ; (1998) 195 CLR 96 at [46] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2233">Its origins lie in the connection that exists between the indigenous inhabitants and the land, in accordance with their traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2234">533 In Mabo (No 2) , Brennan J observed (at 57):
 
 "The term "native title" conveniently describes the interests and rights of indigenous inhabitants in land, whether communal, group or individual, possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged by and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous inhabitants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2235">" 
 

534 The "bundle of rights" which make up native title rights and interests will vary from case to case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2236">That is because native title rights and interests are determined by the particular traditional laws and customs of the indigenous inhabitants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2237">In other words, native title draws its content from the traditional laws and customs of the native title holders: Ward HC at [85].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2238">535 It has long been recognised that the connection that indigenous people have with their country is essentially spiritual: Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (1971) 17 FLR 141 at 167 per Blackburn J, cited with approval in Ward HC at [14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2239">536 In Mabo (No 2) Brennan J said (at 59-60):
 
 "Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and (so far as practicable) to observe the customs based on the traditions of that clan or group, whereby their traditional connexion with the land has been substantially maintained, the traditional community title of that clan or group can be said to remain in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2240">The common law can, by reference to the traditional laws and customs of an indigenous people, identify and protect the native rights and interests to which they give rise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2241">However, when the tide of history has washed away any real acknowledgment of traditional law and any real observance of traditional customs, the foundation of native title has disappeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2242">" 
 

537 His Honour's reference to the "tide of history" having been washed away was applied by Olney J, at first instance, in Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2243">There the application for a determination of native title failed because the evidence did not establish possession of tribal lands, or an observation of laws and customs based on tradition, that could provide a basis for a native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2244">In other words, the particular claimants had ceased to be a traditional indigenous community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2245">Likewise, in Risk , Mansfield J found that the current laws and customs of the Larrakia people were not "traditional" in the sense required by s 223(1) , as explained by the High Court in Yorta Yorta .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2246">538 As previously indicated, "native title" and "native title rights and interests" are expressions defined in s 223(1) of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2247">The definition contained therein is largely a reflection of how native title had been characterised in Mabo (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2248">539 Paragraph (c) of the definition in s 223(1) has the effect of incorporating the common law concept of native title, which may evolve, into the statutory definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2249">By doing so, the legislature has recognised that the law in this area will continue to be developed by the courts, and that the common law of native title will continue to be relevant in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2250">540 In Ward HC, it was held that the first element that had to be met under s 223(1)(a) , namely that the rights and interests of the claimants are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the aboriginal peoples, involved a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2251">That principle was adopted in Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia [2005] FCA 50 ; (2005) 141 FCR 457 (" Gumana "), the case involving Blue Mud Bay in north-east Arnhem Land, at [189] per Selway J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2252">It required identification of the laws and customs said to be "traditional laws acknowledged" and "traditional customs observed", and identification of the rights and interests in relation to land or waters possessed under those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2253">541 The High Court then noted that the second element, namely that the claimants, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters, bore a number of similarities with the first element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2254">That was because the connection with the land or waters required by s 223(1)(b) had to be "by those laws and customs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2255">However, the joint judgment emphasised that there were, nonetheless, two distinct enquiries required by the statutory definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2256">As previously noted at [517], in relation to the first element, the inquiry was as to the rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2257">In relation to the second element the inquiry was into the connection with land or waters by those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2258">542 Section 223(2) of the statutory definition sheds some light upon the meaning of "rights and interests" under s 223(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2259">It does so by expressly providing, without limiting sub-s (1), that native title rights and interests in that sub-section include "hunting, gathering or fishing, rights and interests".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2260">543 It has been suggested that the NT Act includes cultural or spiritual activities within the definition of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2261">Section 211 provides for the protection of native title holders carrying on certain classes of activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2262">In addition to hunting, gathering and fishing, s 211(3)(d) refers to "a cultural or spiritual activity" as a class of activity that is specifically protected under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2263">This class of activity must, however, be done for the purpose of satisfying personal, domestic or non-domestic communal needs, and in exercising enjoyment of native rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2264">544 In Ward first instance, Lee J concluded that the claimants had a right to maintain, protect and prevent the misuse of the cultural knowledge of the native title holders associated with the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2265">545 On appeal ( Western Australia v Ward [2000] FCA 191 ; (2000) 99 FCR 316 (" Ward first Full Court")) in the joint judgment of the majority, Beaumont and von Doussa JJ said at [666] that a right of this type was not a right in relation to land of a kind that could be the subject of a determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2266">Rather, it was a personal right residing in the custodians of the cultural knowledge in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2267">546 In Ward HC , the High Court rejected a challenge to this aspect of the Full Court's reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2268">In substance, it held that the right that Lee J had identified was more akin to an incorporeal right to a new species of intellectual property than an interest in land that would be recognised by the common law under s 223(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2269">547 It is instructive to note the final orders made by the Full Court in Ward when the case was remitted for further hearing and determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2270">See generally Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283 ; (2003) 134 FCR 16 (" A-G (NT) v Ward ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2271">Those orders were made by consent, but after careful consideration of what Ward HC had held to be the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2272">They identified the land and waters of the native title determination area, the members of the "estate groups" that held native title, and the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests of the native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2273">Importantly, they were expressed as "non-exclusive rights to use and enjoy the land and waters" in accordance with the estate group members' traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2274">The word "possess" was not used, and was deliberately avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2275">So too was the word "occupy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2276">It should be noted, however, that the Court accepted, in the determination, an express right to "live on the land, to camp, to erect shelters, and to move about the land".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2277">This may be tantamount to occupation, at least in a general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2278">THE NATURE OF NATIVE TITLE 
 
548 The existence of native title, and its content, must be determined in accordance with the evidence on a case by case basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2279">In some cases, as in Mabo (No 2), the courts have suggested that the content of native title may "approach the rights flowing from full ownership under common law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2280">In other cases it has been suggested that native title may involve little more than a right to come on to land for ceremonial or related purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2281">549 There is a debate as to whether native title rights should properly be regarded as proprietary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2282">In part, this may be because native title rights cannot be assigned or sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2283">That may suggest that such rights are personal, or perhaps should be viewed as sui generis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2284">In Mabo (No 2) , Brennan J observed that even usufructuary rights, which are clearly not proprietary, can be accorded recognition within the ambit of proprietary community title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2285">However, Deane and Gaudron JJ indicated that they regarded native title rights as purely personal, and not proprietary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2286">That was because, not only were those rights inalienable, they could not constitute a legal or beneficial estate or interest in land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2287">550 In Wik , Gummow J said (at 169):
 
 "... the content of native title is to be reached by determination of matters of fact, ascertained by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2288">" 
 

551 In Mabo (No 2) , Toohey J observed that the use of the word "title" in the composite expression "native title" was artificial, and potentially misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2289">Often the rights claimed would not correspond with "ownership" as that term was generally understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2290">Rather, what was at issue was a "special collective right" vested in a particular indigenous group by virtue of its long standing connection with and use of the land or its resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2291">552 In that sense, it may not be particularly fruitful to inquire closely into whether native title is, in truth, best characterised as "proprietary" or "personal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2292">553 Dawson J characterised native title as "a permissive occupancy" in Mabo (No 2) , while in Wik, Kirby J observed (at 215):
 
 "... Aboriginal rights are sui generis, difficult if not impossible to describe in the terminology of traditional property law, being communal, personal and usufructuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2293">" 
 

See also Yarmirr (at [12]) and Ward HC (at [14]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2294">554 On any view, native title lies outside common law doctrines of tenure and estates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2295">555 Native title cannot be alienated outside the native title holding group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2296">It can, of course, be surrendered to the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2297">Within the holding group native title can be transmitted in accordance with traditional rules, including those applicable to death and marriage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2298">THE CLAIMANTS 
 
556 In some native title determination applications, the claimants are in dispute among themselves as to which of them is entitled to hold native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2299">See for example Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia (No 6) [2006] FCA 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2300">557 Fortunately, no issue of that kind arises in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2301">The claimants are united in asserting an identifiable community entitled to enjoy native title rights and interests in accordance with traditional laws and customs as currently acknowledged and observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2302">The Northern Territory, supported by AFANT, challenges their claim to be an identifiable community or group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2303">However, it does so not so as to ensure that the correct persons are identified in any determination, as it did in Ward HC, but rather because it maintains that there is no group that meets the requirements of s 223(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2304">The Northern Territory relies principally upon the evidence of Professor Sansom to make good that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2305">558 When determining who, if anyone, holds native title it is useful to recall the following observation of Brennan J in Mabo (No 2) :
 
 "Membership of the indigenous people depends on biological descent from the indigenous people and on mutual recognition of a particular person's membership by that person and by the elders or other persons enjoying traditional authority among those people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2306">" 
 

559 On one view, this statement of principle suggests that native title can only exist in those who can establish biological descent from the original group in occupation, as at the date of acquisition of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2307">However, the statement needs some qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2308">There have been instances where native title has been recognised after transference from one group to another, in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2309">It is also possible, as the anthropological evidence in the present case makes clear, for one group to succeed to the estate of another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2310">560 In any event there is no real dispute in this case as to the ancestral connection between what might be termed "the original native title holders", and the present claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2311">In Ward first Full Court, it was said (at [234]) that biological descent need not be patrilineal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2312">Biological descent is plainly established in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2313">The issue that divides the parties is simply whether there has been a fundamental change in the normative system that underlies the acquisition of native title, from a patrilineal descent system to a cognatic descent system, and if so, whether that prevents the present claimants from maintaining a traditional connection with the land, in accordance with traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2314">I have already indicated why I would resolve that issue in favour of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2315">THE REQUIREMENT OF CONNECTION 
 
561 The next element that the claimants must establish is the existence of a connection, by the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed, with the land or waters claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2316">In some cases, the question has arisen as to whether the "connection" of which s 223(1)(b) speaks must be physical, or whether some form of spiritual link will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2317">562 This issue does not loom large in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2318">The evidence establishes that the claimants occupy the area in and around Timber Creek not randomly, or because they have happened onto it recently, but because their forbears occupied the region generations ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2319">The land was, and still is, a major part of their economic, cultural and spiritual life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2320">The presence of their ancestors may not have amounted to possession at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2321">It seems, on the evidence, to have been, at least in part, nomadic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2322">However, it certainly qualified as "occupancy", in a broad sense, even allowing for the fact that other indigenous groups frequently came onto the land for ceremonial and other purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2323">Although traditional connection to land can be lost by forcible removal, the evidence does not suggest that this occurred in or near Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2324">563 In Ward HC, Western Australia submitted that proof of continued use of land or waters was essential to the establishment of "connection with the land or waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2325">The High Court rejected that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2326">The joint judgment observed (at [64]) that s 223(1)(b) is not directed at how indigenous people use or occupy land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2327">Whether there is a relevant connection under traditional law or custom with the land or waters will depend, to some degree, upon the content of traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2328">It will also depend upon what is meant by connection "by" those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2329">ARE THE ELEMENTS OF S 223(1) MET?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2330">
 
564 As is apparent, I am satisfied that the claimants have established that they possess native title rights and interests in the claim area, as defined in s 223(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2331">They have demonstrated that they are a society united in and by their acknowledgment and observance of a body of accepted laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2332">They have also demonstrated that this body of accepted laws and customs is, in essence, the same body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by their ancestors, adapted to modern circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2333">565 The final question to be determined is whether the acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs has continued substantially uninterrupted by each generation since sovereignty in 1825, and whether the society has continued to exist throughout that period as a body united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of those laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2334">566 Native title cases are almost always fact specific.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2335">Whatever the position may be in other parts of Australia, the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples who make up the claimants in this case continue to observe the ritual and ceremonial practices of their ancestors in much the same way as they always have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2336">Those ritual and ceremonial practices are largely and inextricably bound up with the land and waters in and around Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2337">567 There are many examples of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2338">Even putting to one side high order ritual practice, these examples include initiation rites, head wetting ceremonies, protection of sacred and Dreaming sites, traditional methods of hunting, fishing and gathering food, and the ongoing practice of Winan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2339">568 I am satisfied that, in 1825, the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples were a society united in and by their acknowledgment and observance of accepted laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2340">That society survived early European settlement, and continued into and throughout the 20 th Century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2341">The claimants are the direct descendents of indigenous persons who made up that society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2342">569 I am further satisfied that the claimants are the direct descendents of indigenous persons who maintained a connection to the land and waters in and around Timber Creek, not just since the time of initial European contact, but at least as far back as 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2343">570 It is hardly surprising that there is no direct evidence pointing to the claimants' ancestors having occupied and used this land prior to sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2344">Given that the first significant European contact did not occur until 1839, and that the area was not settled until the 1880s, it is scarcely likely that there would be written records relating to the indigenous inhabitants of the region that reflect conditions prior to 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2345">571 Nonetheless, as Mr Lewis has demonstrated, there are some references in the historical documents dating back to the middle of the nineteenth century which refer to the indigenous inhabitants of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2346">These documents suggest that the indigenous people who occupied the Victoria River district maintained a continuing presence in the area, and were not merely transient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2347">572 Evidence given in the Timber Creek Land Claim in 1985, and also in the other land claims involving adjacent areas, establishes a direct connection between the claimants, and their direct ancestors, in relation to Makalamayi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2348">That connection can easily be traced back at least as far as the latter part of the nineteenth century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2349">If, as the evidence suggests, Lamparangana was the central figure in and around that area (to the extent that it was even known as "Lamparangana's country"), there is a clear link, along ancestral lines, between the senior claimants in these proceedings and at least the early years of Lamparangana's life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2350">Bearing in mind that he probably died in the late 1940s, and that he seems to have lived to an old age, it may reasonably be inferred that his connection with the land goes back to 1880, or perhaps earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2351">573 For present purposes, this evidence goes some way towards satisfying the requirement of connection under s 223(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2352">It is easily forgotten that the elderly, when they recall the events of their childhood, and what they may have been told by their grandparents, are in effect, recounting events that go back perhaps as far as a century and a half.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2353">574 Of course what they were told will be hearsay, but it is hearsay of a kind that has been readily admitted in native title cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2354">In Gumana , the relevant date for sovereignty was 1788, and not 1825.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2355">Selway J concluded that the evidence tendered by the applicants of genealogies and linguistics was sufficient to establish that some of the ancestors of persons who were currently claimants were members of Yolngu society in 1788 and, indeed, well before then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2356">575 His Honour said (at [194]):
 
 "Ultimately the evidence of the existence of the relevant Aboriginal tradition and custom as at 1788, and of the rights held by the particular clans in 1788 and thereafter pursuant to that tradition and custom, is based upon evidence derived from what the Yolngu claimants currently do and from what they have observed their parents and elders do and from what they were told by their parents and elders ..." 
 

576 His Honour continued (at [195]):
 
 "As already discussed, there is nothing peculiar or unique about this sort of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2357">It is oral evidence of a custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2358">It is evidence of fact, not opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2359">To the extent that it consists of what Mr Gumana was told by his father and by other old people it constitutes a recognised exception to the rule against hearsay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2360">" 
 

577 It is reasonable to infer that the indigenous people who inhabited the Timber Creek region in about the middle of the nineteenth century, and who acknowledged and observed essentially the same laws and customs as do the present claimants did not simply invent them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2361">There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the ritual and ceremonial practices observed by the inhabitants of this area since about that time, in a largely unbroken pattern, were suddenly created, or radically transformed from what had gone immediately before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2362">The ethnography, and the few contemporary records that are available, support the conclusion that this pattern has evolved over hundreds of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2363">578 In Gumana , Selway J adopted precisely the same approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2364">Referring to the difficulty that the evidence could not literally take the Court back as far as 1788, his Honour observed (at [197]):
 
 "This problem is one that is well known to the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2365">There are a number of circumstances where it was necessary at common law to establish proof of custom dating back not just to the 18 th century, but to 'time immemorial'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2366">Proof of copyhold was one example ... Another, ... was the proof of ancient custom as a means of establishing either prescription or ancient lost grant 'from time immemorial'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2367">" 
 

579 His Honour noted that, like the evidence called to prove aboriginal custom, the evidence called to prove the existence of a custom from "time immemorial" for the purposes of the common law was often oral evidence and it was subject to the same difficulties in relating that evidence back --- although not just to the eighteenth century, but to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2368">In practice, those difficulties were ameliorated by the readiness of the common law courts to infer from proof of the existence of a current custom that that custom had continued from time immemorial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2369">The inference was a strong one: Hammerton v Honey (1876) 24 WR 603 at 604 per Jessell MR.
 
580 There is no reason why the same evidentiary inference is not available for the purpose of proving the existence of aboriginal custom and tradition at the date of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2370">As Selway J noted in Gumana (at [201]), there are a number of cases where such inferences have been drawn, although without expressly acknowledging the common law authorities which support that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2371">581 In arriving at my finding that the claimants have essentially the same system of traditions, laws and customs as their ancestors did in 1825, and that those traditions and customs have been observed continuously since that date, I have had regard to the genealogies prepared by Dr Palmer and Ms Asche appended to their joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2372">If those genealogies are reliable, and I have no reason to believe that they are not, they identify Lamparangana's father, Mungkawali, and his mother, Parratpawuk/Yitpali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2373">They also identify Lamparangana's uncles and aunts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2374">582 Assuming that Lamparangana was taught the laws and customs associated with Makalamayi by his father, Mungkawali, or perhaps by his uncle, Minjiringikari, in accordance with the normal cultural and spiritual precepts applicable, those individuals would have had to gain their knowledge of "country" a generation or so prior to Lamparangana's birth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2375">That takes the position back to around 1850.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2376">Those who imparted that knowledge to Lamparangana's father or uncle would have had to have gained their knowledge at or about the time of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2377">583 I accept that there will be some cases where the need to go back thirty or forty years beyond the earliest extant genealogy would render the process too speculative to permit an inference of continuity or connection to be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2378">However, in the present case, the position seems to me to be different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2379">It is known that indigenous people occupied the Timber Creek region at least as far back as the time of the earliest explorers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2380">It is also known that inhabitants of that area adopted laws and customs that were, ethnographically, very similar to the laws and customs that indigenous people in other parts of Australia followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2381">A number of the ritual practices that are documented at least as far back as the latter part of the nineteenth century are, in significant respects, similar to those followed by aboriginal people since well before European settlement in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2382">It would be wrong, in my view, to approach the issue of connection by turning a blind eye to these historical realities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2383">584 It follows in my view that the senior claimants in these proceedings have established that they are the direct descendants of a group of indigenous inhabitants of the area around Timber Creek, and that they observe essentially the same rituals and ceremonies as were practised by their ancestors more than a century ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2384">I infer that those same rituals and ceremonies have been followed by indigenous people who are the direct ancestors of the claimants since before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2385">The rights and interests that have passed on through this system of descent are, in my view, recognised by the common law of Australia, and are therefore properly to be characterised as native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2386">585 Subject to determining whether the native title rights and interests that have been established are to be characterised as "exclusive" or "non-exclusive", and subject also to resolving any questions of extinguishment, the claimants have succeeded in demonstrating the elements necessary under s 223(1) of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2387">THE CLAIMANTS' NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS 
 
586 As already indicated, I am satisfied that the land and waters of the claim area occupy an important role in the claimants' belief system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2388">Many claimants reside in the area itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2389">Others visit it frequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2390">They use the land for hunting, fishing, and gathering food, and for ceremonial activities and they acknowledge and observe a body of traditional laws and customs which connect them to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2391">Their ancestors acknowledged and observed essentially that same body of laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2392">The evidence suggests that these laws and customs have been in existence for generations, since well before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2393">587 The claimants share a set of beliefs that govern the rights and obligations of indigenous persons who wish to have access to, and use, the land and waters of the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2394">588 These findings do not of themselves resolve the question whether the claimants' native title is, as they contend, a right to "possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the determination area to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2395">Both the Northern Territory and AFANT submit that even if native title is found to exist, the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area should not be "exclusive", but rather akin to rights that are usufructuary in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2396">589 If, as the Northern Territory and AFANT contend, the past grant of pastoral leases in the claim area means native title has been wholly extinguished, it would be entirely pointless to proceed to consider the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests that might have been found to exist, but for extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2397">If, however, as the claimants contend, s 47B of the NT Act operates to require any extinguishment of native title rights and interests in the area to be disregarded, s 225(b) requires any determination of native title to include a determination as to the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2398">590 It will often be difficult to determine whether native title rights and interests are to be regarded as "exclusive", or as "non-exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2399">591 In Mabo (No 2) , the High Court held that, on acquiring sovereignty, the Crown acquired the "radical", or "ultimate" title to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2400">This empowered the Crown to deal with the land, but did not of itself confer full beneficial ownership to the exclusion of native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2401">In Ward HC, the High Court described native title (at [91]) as "legally fragile".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2402">It could be impaired, or even extinguished, by the Crown and, when colonial legislatures ultimately came into existence, by them exercising their sovereign rights to deal with land within their territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2403">592 The NT Act , in its original form, dealt exhaustively with most aspects of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2404">It made provision for the establishment of its existence, and how it might be extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2405">593 The decision in Wik signalled an end to the comparatively straightforward regime created under the original version of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2406">After the amendments came into force in 1998, the process became more complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2407">594 Notwithstanding the strictures in Ward HC regarding the need to focus primarily upon the provisions of the NT Act in native title cases (rather than the common law), native title, as developed by the common law, remains important when construing the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2408">As previously mentioned, s 223(1)(c) provides that native title rights and interests, in order to be established under the NT Act , must be "recognised by the common law of Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2409">At common law, the nature and extent of native title is essentially a question of fact to be determined from such evidence as is available regarding the traditional laws and customs associated with the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2410">Exactly the same is true under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2411">595 Native title is usually communal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2412">However, in some circumstances a claim to group or individual native title rights and interests may be brought: see Mabo (No 2) at 52, 85, 88, and 109-110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2413">596 In De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (" De Rose No 2 "), the Full Court observed (at [38]):
 
 "If it is necessary for the purposes of proceedings under the NT Act to distinguish between a claim to communal native title and a claim to group or individual native title rights and interests, the critical point appears to be that communal native title presupposes that the claim is made on behalf of a recognisable community of people, whose traditional laws and customs constitute the normative system under which rights and interests are created and acknowledged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2414">That is, the traditional laws and customs are those of the very community which claims native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2415">By contrast, group and individual native title rights and interests derive from a body of traditional laws and customs observed by a community, but are not necessarily claimed on behalf of the whole community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2416">Indeed, they may not be claimed on behalf of any recognisable community at all, but on behalf of individuals who themselves have never constituted a cohesive, functioning community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2417">" 
 

597 Traditional laws may also recognise the entitlement of individuals or groups from other areas to exercise customary hunting or ceremonial rights within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2418">598 It seems clear that at the heart of native title lie principles of descent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2419">Professor Peter Butt, whose text " Land Law " (5 th ed, 2006) provides a helpful overview of this area, comments at 934, footnote 54:
 
 "Where traditional descent rules can no longer operate --- for example, through diminution of the primary native title-holding group --- neighbouring or related groups may operate as custodians for the area until the proper line of descent can be re-established or until they assume primary responsibility for the area themselves: see generally Re Waanyi People's Native Title Application (1954) 129 ALR 118 at 133-134 (Tribunal President, French J); Wandarang, Alawa, Marra and Ngalakan Peoples v Northern Territory [2000] FCA 923 ; (2000) 104 FCR 380 at 400, 406, 410-11; De Rose v South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 at 339-342.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2420">" 
 

599 Clearly, as Professor Butt observes, native title may possess characteristics that are not generally known under Australian common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2421">That of itself is no bar to recognition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2422">There is no particular reason why native title should not be recognised where the evidence suggests that the incidents of that title are less extensive than rights held by the Crown, or granted to others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2423">An example is a usufructuary right, which is generally classified as personal, rather than proprietary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2424">However, if the incidents are more extensive than rights that the Crown holds, or can grant to others, the common law may not be able to recognise native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2425">In any such case, s 223(1)(c) will operate to prevent any determination in those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2426">600 Professor Butt cites an important illustration of this principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2427">He says that the common law rights of the Crown do not permit it to interfere with the free navigation of offshore waters or, as he puts it, the "public right to fish".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2428">Accordingly, he contends that the common law cannot recognise an "exclusive" indigenous right to fish, or for that matter an "exclusive" right of navigation in offshore waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2429">Nor, of course, can it recognise rights that are inconsistent with the underlying structure of the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2430">He refers, in that regard to Mabo (No 2) (at 43 per Brennan J), and to Ward HC (at [21]-[22]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2431">601 For the same reason the common law cannot recognise rights that concern a purely spiritual relationship between indigenous people and the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2432">Such a relationship can provide evidence of a connection with the land, but is not itself a right that the common law can accommodate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2433">See generally Ward HC (at [57]-[61]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2434">602 Having found, as I have, that the claimants have met the requirements of s 223(1) of the NT Act , it is now necessary to determine whether the incidents of the native title rights and interests that have been demonstrated are "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2435">In other words, have the claimants established that they are entitled, as they contend, "to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the area claimed to the exclusion of all others "?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2436">A related question is whether they have established, as they contend, that they have the right to control "the access of others to the application area", and "the use and enjoyment of others of the resources of the application area".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2437">603 If the native title rights and interests of the claimants are "exclusive", in the sense discussed above, the potential for conflict between native title and any acts of extinguishment will be greater than if those rights and interests are "non-exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2438">That is so because of the way in which the principles of extinguishment operate under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2439">604 It is worth pausing for a moment to remember that at common law, extinguishment occurred when the Crown did an act that evinced a "clear and plain intention" to extinguish native title: Mabo (No 2) at 64, 111 and 196.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2440">Once native title was extinguished, it was extinguished for all time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2441">It must be remembered, however, that there was a presumption in relation to common law extinguishment that the Crown did not intend native title to cease to exist merely through the act of acquiring sovereignty: Mabo (No 2) at 57, 82 and 184.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2442">605 Under the NT Act , extinguishment can only take place in accordance with the requirements of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2443">The question is whether the legislature granted, or authorised the grant of, interests that were inconsistent with native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2444">The test is objective, and has nothing to do with any actual intent on the legislature's part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2445">606 As previously indicated, s 223(1) requires that the native title rights and interests that are claimed be communal, group or individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2446">They must be rights and interests in relation to "land" or "waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2447">Both terms are defined in s 253 , which relevantly provides:
 
 " land includes the airspace over, or subsoil under, land, but does not include waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2448">
 ... 
 waters includes: 
 
 
 
 (a) sea, a river, a lake, a tidal inlet, a bay, an estuary, a harbour or subterranean waters; or

 (c) the shore, or subsoil under or airspace over the shore, between high water and low water.</sentence>

 607 Ward HC held, on the basis of these definitions, that an asserted right to control representations or depictions of land, expressed as a right to maintain cultural knowledge about land or waters, was not a right that could properly be protected under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2450">Such a right related to information, and not to land, as that term is defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2451">See also Alyawarr (at [134]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2452">608 In some circumstances, native title will be found to be "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2453">In such cases, the "bundle of rights and interests" that make up native title may be expressed as including "a right to possession, occupation, use, and enjoyment of the land or waters to the exclusion of all others ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2454">Recent examples include the consent determinations made by Black CJ in both Lota Warria (on behalf of the Poruma and Masig Peoples) v Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 62 (at 65) , and Billy (on behalf of the Poruma People) v Queensland (2005) 223 ALR 447 (at 450).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2455">609 In cases where there has been partial (though not total) extinguishment it is necessary to specify with some care the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests that have been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2456">This is often done by referring, in a native title determination, to those activities that may be carried out on the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2457">610 Some examples of these more limited forms of native title rights and interests may include:
 
 
 &#8226; rights to live on the land ( Alyawarr );
 &#8226; rights to conserve the natural resources of the land for the benefit of the native title holders ( Ward HC);
 &#8226; rights to hunt, gather or fish for the purpose of satisfying personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs ( Billy v Queensland );
 &#8226; rights to maintain, use and manage the land by protecting significant sites, inheriting or passing on native title rights, determining who are the native title holders, resolving disputes about native title rights, and conducting social, religious, cultural and spiritual activities on the land ( Alyawarr );
 &#8226; rights to control the disclosure of spiritual practices and beliefs which relate to the land or waters ( Alyawarr ); and
 &#8226; rights to use and enjoy natural resources for traditional and customary purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2458">
 

611 Rights of this character, expressed in this way, seem not to be relevantly "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2459">They can, however, be enforced in order to prevent others from infringing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2460">They may also confer upon their holders a limited entitlement to control access to the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2461">That limited entitlement exists essentially only for the purpose of ensuring that the primary right can be properly exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2462">Such rights fall short of conferring what would normally be described as "ownership" of the land, and perhaps also any proprietary interest akin thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2463">612 In Amodu Tijani v The Secretary, Southern Nigeria [1921] 2 AC 399, Viscount Haldane said (at 403):
 
 "A very usual form of native title is that of a usufructuary right, which is a mere qualification of or burden on the radical or final title of the sovereign where that exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2464">" 
 
 

613 In Mabo (No 2) , Brennan J referred to native title "whether classified by the common law as proprietary, usufructuary or otherwise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2465">A usufruct has been described as "a personal servitude not annexed to land".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2466">It includes rights to hunt and fish on the land or in the waters over which one does not necessarily have dominion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2467">The term "usufructuary right" commonly conveys the entitlement of an individual to use and take benefit from land belonging to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2468">614 The question to be determined in these proceedings is whether the native title rights and interests of the claimants that have been established rise significantly above the level of usufructuary rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2469">In my view, that question should be answered both "yes" and "no".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2470">The evidence in this case establishes both usufructuary and proprietary rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2471">However, it falls short of establishing native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area "to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2472">It also falls short of establishing an unfettered right on the part of the claimants to control others' access to that area, or to control others' use and enjoyment of the resources of that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2473">615 It is true that some of the indigenous witnesses who gave evidence on site characterised a "Yakpali mululu" as someone who could "deny others access to certain foraging areas".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2474">For example, Josie Jones said that if someone wanted to build in Makalamayi "they would have to ask permission".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2475">She added that if a white person wished to go on to the land, that person would be expected to ask permission first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2476">The purpose of that request would be to enable important sites to be identified, presumably so that those sites might be protected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2477">616 I note that Mrs Jones acknowledged that she had never told anyone not to fish in the waters of Timber Creek, or indeed in the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2478">She said, however, that if she had been asked, she would have pointed out to them which sites were sacred, and also which sites were dangerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2479">617 Mr Harrington gave evidence regarding those who had to be consulted in relation to any activities at Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2480">A number of other witnesses also gave evidence about the process of consultation that had been followed in relation to a proposed mine that did not proceed because it was too close to a particular site of significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2481">618 Jerry Jones told Dr Palmer and Ms Asche that he regarded himself as entitled to fish, camp, hunt, take ochre and induct strangers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2482">He said that indigenous persons who were not members of the Ngaliwurru-Nungali community were expected to "ask permission" before doing any of these things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2483">However, he added that he regarded seeking permission as irrelevant because, in practice, no indigenous person would wander about on the land without the guidance of a member of that community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2484">To do so would be to court disaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2485">619 There are scattered references in some of the anthropological material which hint at the need to obtain permission before going onto the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2486">However, in my view, these few references do not justify a finding that the rights and interests of the claimants operate "to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2487">Rather, they suggest that there is an ingrained belief on the part of the claimants that those who come to Timber Creek will, without anything having to be said, respect the claimants' "rights to country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2488">It is almost as if "permission" will be sought as a matter of courtesy, or form, because this is expected when a stranger passes through someone else's land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2489">If for some reason permission is not sought, then guidance at least will be requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2490">620 The evidence supporting the claimants' right to exclude others from using the waters of Timber Creek is, if anything, even weaker than that in relation to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2491">There is very little evidence directed to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2492">There was nothing to suggest that any attempt had ever been made to restrict access to the Creek by fishermen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2493">There was little, if any, evidence to suggest that traditional law and custom, acknowledged and observed, would operate to restrict such access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2494">The evidence was largely directed to use of the land, rather than the waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2495">It follows that any native title rights that exist in relation to those waters will be non-exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2496">It also follows that, as a practical matter, there is little need to consider what effect, if any, the so-called "public right to fish" might have upon native title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2497">EXTINGUISHMENT BY PASTORAL LEASE 
 
621 It is common ground between the parties that the claim area was, at one time, in its entirety, the subject of pastoral leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2498">A detailed folder setting out the tenure history was tendered by consent, but it is not necessary to spell out in detail what it contains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2499">622 It is sufficient for present purposes to summarise briefly one particular pastoral lease granted in this area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2500">That lease is typical of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2501">623 The particular lease that I have singled out is headed "Crown Lease Northern Territory Pastoral 2189".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2502">It was granted on 14 December 1901.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2503">The lessees were Connor Doherty and Durack Limited of Fremantle, Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2504">The lease recited that the Governor of South Australia, acting pursuant to the Northern Territory Land Act 1899 , and in the name of King Edward VII, demised some 850 square miles set forth in a plan annexed to the indenture (which included the area south of the Victoria River, near "Gregorys Principal Camp"), subject to certain reservations, for a term of forty-two years, for an annual rent of sixty-three pounds, fifteen shillings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2505">The lessees covenanted that they would, during the lease, pay the rent, and within the first three years stock the land with at least five head of sheep or one head of cattle for every square mile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2506">They further covenanted that they would keep the land so stocked, and before the end of the seventh year of the lease increase the stocking to at least ten head of sheep or two head of cattle for every square mile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2507">There were other covenants of a similar nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2508">624 It is significant to note that among the reservations in the lease, there was a right in favour of the "Aboriginal Inhabitants of the State and their descendants" to:
 
 "full and free right of ingress egress and regress into upon and over the said lands and every part thereof and in and to the springs and natural surface water thereon and to make and erect such wurlies and other dwellings as the said Aboriginal Natives have been heretofore accustomed to make and erect and to take and use for food birds and animals ferae naturae in such manner as they would have been entitled to do if this lease had not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2509">" 
 

625 There is no question in the present case of extinguishment by necessary implication, whether partial or whole, through legislation regulating the use or occupation of Crown lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2510">It appears that the claim area has not been the subject of any fee simple grants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2511">Nor has it been the subject of any common law leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2512">A grant in fee simple, or a common law lease, will normally extinguish native title because the holder in fee simple has the right, essentially, to use the land as that person sees fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2513">That right is incompatible with the exercise of any native title right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2514">Similarly, the grant of a leasehold interest confers upon a tenant the legal right to exclusive possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2515">That right, too, is inconsistent with the continued existence of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2516">626 Pastoral leases of the type that feature in this case present special difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2517">Wik considered whether extinguishment followed automatically from the grant of such leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2518">The High Court noted that the term "pastoral lease" described a variety of statutory tenures in which the Crown grants rights to occupy land for pastoral purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2519">The pastoral leases in Wik were expressed in the traditional language of common law leases, and the legislation under which they were granted used similar terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2520">The "leases" in that case, unlike those in the present case, contained no specific reservation in favour of indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2521">In addition, the properties over which they were granted were very large, far greater in area than, for example, Pastoral Lease 2189.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2522">They were also located in a remote part of Queensland, and not in or near a township within the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2523">627 As is well known, the High Court in Wik divided four to three on the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2524">The minority (Brennan CJ, with whom Dawson and McHugh JJ agreed), held that the pastoral lease under consideration conferred a right of exclusive possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2525">The legislation used terms of art such as "demise", "rent", "surrender" and "forfeiture", all consistent with the creation of a common law lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2526">Not only that, but the legislation also distinguished between a "lease", and a "licence" granted under it: Wik (at 76 and 80).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2527">In those circumstances, to recognise any interest, such as native title, not derived from the Crown, would "fracture a skeletal principle of land law", namely the doctrine of tenures and estates: Wik (at 92-93).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2528">628 The majority in Wik (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ), held that the grant of pastoral leases would not necessarily extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2529">Despite the use of technical terms characteristic of ordinary leases, pastoral leases were not to be equated with leasehold interests at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2530">In particular, pastoral leases did not confer a right of exclusive possession: Wik (at 118, 152, 176 and 224).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2531">629 In arriving at this conclusion, the majority considered not only the terms used in the grants, but also the historical background to the legislation authorising them, and the limited "pastoral purposes" for which the lessees had the right to occupy the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2532">In their view, the relevant question was whether any statutory rights that were conferred were so inconsistent with the continued existence of native title as to lead to the conclusion that such title had been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2533">That question could be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2534">630 The decision in Wik was subsequently approved in Ward HC, a case concerning pastoral leases granted under analogous legislation in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2535">Once again, the High Court held that these statutory interests did not extinguish all native title rights and interests even though they were granted without the benefit of a reservation in favour of aboriginal peoples: Ward HC (at [186]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2536">631 As the law now stands, whether an interest granted under a pastoral lease extinguishes native title requires a comparison to be undertaken of the legal nature and incidents of the native title with the rights conferred on the lessee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2537">This is sometimes described as the "inconsistency of incidents" test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2538">If the incidents of the respective rights are such that native title could not be exercised without abrogating the statutory right, native title is extinguished, (at least to the extent of the inconsistency).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2539">This approach accords with the view that native title consists essentially of a "bundle of rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2540">If pastoral leases do not extinguish native title completely, they may nonetheless impair any native title rights that would otherwise amount to incidents of full ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2541">They may thereby abrogate any "exclusive" native title rights and interests: Ward HC (at [308]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2542">632 It is important to remember that native title is not extinguished merely by the enactment of legislation under which rights may be granted in the future, or by conditions which deprive a grant of legal effect until they are fulfilled: see Ward HC (at [149]-[151]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2543">Inconsistency will not be readily inferred if the grant contains qualifications or reservations that preserve the entitlement of indigenous people to continue to carry out their traditional activities on the land, as is the case with the pastoral leases granted in the Timber Creek region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2544">Finally, it should be noted that the question of inconsistency must be determined at the date the grant takes effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2545">As at that date, rights are either inconsistent, or they are not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2546">633 Given the fact-specific nature of native title, the question of inconsistency can rarely be determined in the abstract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2547">The nature and content of native title, and that of any statutory interests that are said to be inconsistent with that title, will vary from case to case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2548">634 In Mabo (No 2) , Brennan J provided some helpful examples of just how native title would be extinguished at common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2549">His Honour noted (at 68 and 70) that extinguishment would result from Crown or legislative vesting of land for a road, railway, or any other purpose that necessarily precluded continued enjoyment of native title to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2550">635 Ward HC held (at [214] and [217]) that a statutory dedication or reservation of land for an intended purpose, short of vesting title in the Crown or a statutory authority, did not of itself extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2551">However, such a dedication or reservation would certainly extinguish any native title rights that were equivalent to ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2552">That was because the exercise of the power to dedicate or reserve land was inconsistent with any continuing native title right to control access to land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2553">In other words, in such circumstances there would be partial extinguishment, which would not, however, prevent native title holders from using the land according to traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2554">EXISTENCE OF NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS 
 
636 In arriving at any native title determination, in accordance with s 225 of the NT Act , it is necessary to have regard to the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2555">I am satisfied that these traditional laws and traditional customs have their source in a coherent social system that has existed, in a largely continuous form, since before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2556">They have been passed down from generation to generation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2557">As one would expect, they have evolved, and adapted to new circumstances, but that has not altered their substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2558">637 I am conscious of the fact that there has been some loss of language by the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2559">Nungali is no longer widely spoken, and is well on the way to becoming extinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2560">It is, however, closely related to Ngaliwurru, and on one view is merely a dialect of a broader indigenous language peculiar to the Ngaliwurru-Nungali people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2561">638 I am also conscious of the fact that adherence to ritual is no longer as strict as it once was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2562">That is hardly surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2563">In Mabo (No 2) , it was recognised that, at common law, modification of laws and customs over the years did not necessarily mean the loss of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2564">The position is no different, in that regard, under the provisions of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2565">639 As long as the claimants continue to observe their traditions and customs, and maintain their links with and use of the land, and waters, native title will continue to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2566">It is only if the society as a whole ceases to adhere to that traditional law, particularly in relation to the use or occupation of the land, that native title will be lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2567">640 Of course, the claimants are not required under s 223 to establish patrilineal descent, in its pure form, from the indigenous groups that exercised traditional rights over the claim area at the time of sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2568">Indeed, at least in a formal sense, they need not even establish strict biological descent: De Rose v South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 (" De Rose No 1 ") (at [200] and [236]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2569">They must, however, demonstrate a commonality of interest, based upon traditional laws and customs, and a connection with the land or waters of a relevant kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2570">641 There is little direct evidence linking the laws and customs observed by the current claimants with the practices followed by their forbears at or before sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2571">In Yorta Yorta , this proved fatal to the applicants' claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2572">That was because there was a significant break, over a number of years, in the proven connection between any indigenous persons and the land in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2573">642 It is well established, however, that if traditional use can be traced back a long way, though not as far back as 1825, then use back to that date may be inferred: Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572 (at 583, and 588-9 per Kirby P), and Neowarra (at [48] per Sundberg J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2574">643 There is, however, one discrete matter that still needs to be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2575">Throughout the whole of these proceedings, the Northern Territory argued that the claimants had to demonstrate not only a "connection" with the land or waters in question, but also what may loosely be described as a "causal" link.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2576">The basis for that submission was the use of the word "by" ahead of "those laws and customs" in s 223(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2577">644 Ward HC made clear (at [93]) that evidence that the ancestors of the claimant group occupied the land does not, of itself, establish the required connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2578">It also made clear, however, that s 223(1)(b) does not require proof of continuous physical presence on the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2579">The section is not directed to how indigenous people may have used or occupied land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2580">Rather, it focuses upon whether, the claimants, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed, can demonstrate a "connection" with the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2581">645 It follows that s 223(1)(b) requires first an identification of the content of traditional laws and customs, and next an analysis of the effect of those laws and customs as constituting a "connection" of the peoples with the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2582">Although evidence of historical presence on the land is relevant when considering "connection", native title can be found even though the physical presence on the land is neither continuous nor contemporary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2583">646 In Yarmirr , the High Court made it clear (at [16]) that it is not necessary that the laws and customs by which the connection occurs themselves contain mechanisms for enforcing that connection, or that they contain sanctions for breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2584">That is important, so far as this case is concerned, because there is a paucity of evidence before me regarding such matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2585">647 In Alyawarr the Full Court observed (at [93]) that although "connection" is a prerequisite to the recognition of native title rights and interests, it does not limit or qualify the content of any rights and interests arising under traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2586">Rather, the content of those rights and interests is marked out by the requirement that they be rights or interests "in relation to land or waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2587">648 Nonetheless, evidence led to demonstrate the existence of a traditional system of laws and customs may also be relevant when determining whether the requisite "connection" has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2588">As Professor Butt notes in his text (at 949):
 
 "... evidence of site-specific activities such as holding ceremonies, transmitting sacred or secular knowledge, seasonal occupation of places, and use of land to obtain traditional food, may be given in the context of the rules that establish or maintain kinship or totemic relationships between people and land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2589">In this sense, although certain rights in traditional law (such as purely spiritual rights) cannot be recognised as native title rights, evidence of those rights may go to prove the existence of continuing traditional laws, or connection to the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2590">" 
 

 649 Yorta Yorta makes clear that once a connection with the land is lost, native title cannot be restored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2591">The question under s 223(1)(b) is whether "connection" has relevantly persisted through the retention and transmission of law and custom concerning the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2592">650 In De Rose No 1 , the Full Court (at [326]) referred to Yorta Yorta (at [90]) as having established that if continuity of acknowledgment and observance of traditional laws and customs has been interrupted, the reasons for the interruption are irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2593">The Full Court went on to say that Yorta Yorta also established that the reasons why acknowledgment and observance had been affected might influence the fact-finder's decision as to whether there was an absence of continuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2594">The same applied in relation to the question of connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2595">If the requisite connection did not exist, or had ended, it did not matter why that had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2596">However, in determining whether there was a connection for the purposes of s 223(1)(b) , the reason why the claimants had not sought to maintain a physical association with the land might be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2597">651 Professor Butt observes, in relation to connection (at 949-950):
 
 "Because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies are so diverse, no single activity or form of relationship between people and place can determine the question of connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2598">Ultimately, a finding of connection by traditional law and custom reflects a conclusion drawn from all the evidence of relationship between the claimants and the land or waters in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2599">Early accounts of settlement and occupation of the continent will be relevant in establishing connection, where they point to historical occupation from which an inference of continuity can be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2600">" 
 

652 Applying these principles to the evidence before me, the claimants have established a connection with the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2601">The evidence points strongly to a long-standing link between the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples and the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2602">That relationship is grounded in traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2603">It is manifested in almost every facet of life among the claimants, and in the ritual and ceremonial practices that play such a prominent role in their existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2604">Their connection to the land is "by" the traditional laws that they acknowledge, and "by" the traditional customs that they observe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2605">The evidence establishes that they have maintained the necessary connection with the claim area since the time the Crown first asserted sovereignty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2606">653 As previously indicated, s 223(1)(c) requires that the rights and interests claimed as native title must be "recognised" by the common law of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2607">In other words, those rights and interests must fall, somehow, within the framework of the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2608">On this basis, as Ward HC holds, rights to control the depiction or representation of the land cannot be recognised under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2609">To the extent that any such rights are claimed in these proceedings, that claim must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2610">654 In Yarmirr , the High Court held that a claim to native title (over the coastal seas and offshore areas) need not have been capable of recognition by the common law at the time that sovereignty was acquired, provided that the common law would recognise the rights in question now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2611">In other words, s 223(1)(c) operates contemporaneously, and does not look to the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2612">655 In summary, I am satisfied that some, but not all, of the native title rights and interests claimed in these proceedings are, relevantly, "recognised" by Australian common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2613">Any native title rights and interests that are not so recognised will, of course, be excluded from any native title determination that the Court ultimately makes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2614">CAN S 47B BE INVOKED TO OVERCOME EXTINGUISHMENT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2615">
 
656 The tenure history of the claim area, and in particular the fact that it was all previously subject to pastoral leases, makes it plain that, subject to the possible operation of s 47B of the NT Act , native title has been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2616">If s 47B has the effect for which the claimants contend, it is unnecessary to resolve the question whether such extinguishment would otherwise be total, or only partial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2617">The reason is that, pursuant to s 47B , extinguishment will simply be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2618">657 In order to invoke s 47B a series of conditions must be met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2619">In particular it must be shown that at the time the claimant application was made:
 
 
 &#8226; the area was not covered by a freehold estate or a lease; and
 &#8226; the area was not covered by a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority, made or conferred by the Crown in any capacity, or by the making, amendment or repeal of legislation under which the whole or a part of the land or waters in the area was to be used for public purposes or for a particular purpose; and
 &#8226; the area was not subject to a resumption process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2620">
 

658 In addition, s 47B requires the claimants to show that at the time the native title application was made one or more of their number occupied the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2621">659 In the event that the relevant conditions are met, s 47B(2) provides that for all purposes under the NT Act , any extinguishment of the native title rights and interests in relation to the area that are claimed in the application by the creation of any prior interest in relation to the area must be "disregarded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2622">A note to s 47B(2) states explicitly that an applicant:
 
 "... will still need to show the existence of any connection with the land or waters concerned that may be required by the common law concept of native title".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2623">
 

660 It is common ground that when the application for a determination of native title in the present case was made, Timber Creek was not covered by a freehold estate or lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2624">Nor was it subject to any resumption process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2625">661 Two issues arise for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2626">First, was the area in question was covered by a proclamation under which the whole, or a part, of the land or waters was to be used for public purposes, or for a particular purpose?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2627">Second, did one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area when the application was made?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2628">Cases dealing with s 47B 
 
662 In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 (" Hayes "), Olney J discussed the requirement that members of the native title claim group "occupy" the relevant area for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2629">His Honour observed (at [125]) that "occupation" of land should be understood in the sense that indigenous people have traditionally occupied land, rather than according to common law principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2630">He indicated that judicial authority relating to freehold and leasehold estates, and other statutory rights, might not be of great assistance in resolving this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2631">He said that the use of "country" by members of a claim group in a way that was neither random nor coincidental, but accorded with the traditional way of life, habits, customs and usages of the group was sufficient to indicate occupation of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2632">663 Section 47B and its requirements were also discussed in Daniel per RD Nicholson J (at [958]-[973]), Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia [2003] FCA 1177 per Mansfield J and Kenyon v Northern Territory of Australia [2003] FCA 1178 per Mansfield J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2633">664 More recently, the Full Court in Alyawarr considered in some detail the operation of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2634">The issue arose in the context of a proclamation of a town site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2635">The area in question concerned Hatches Creek, a proposed town site which occupied some twenty-seven hectares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2636">The land was vacant Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2637">Although it had been set aside for a proposed town in 1953, no town had ever been established there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2638">665 The Hatches Creek area had been the subject of pastoral lease and grazing licence grants in the 1890s, and subsequently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2639">It was common ground that this meant that, subject to s 47B , any native title rights that might otherwise have existed would be extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2640">666 In relation to the issue of occupation at the time the application was made, the evidence was that Hatches Creek had no physical features or significance to suggest that it was continually occupied, in the sense of having permanent residents, at the time the application was brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2641">Mansfield J, the judge at first instance, referred with approval to what Olney J had said in Hayes regarding the concept of occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2642">Mansfield J found that members of the native title claim group had occupied Hatches Creek, in the relevant sense, at the time the application was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2643">His Honour's conclusion was based largely on inference, drawing on the fact that members of the claim group lived nearby, and that they hunted on and traversed the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2644">For that reason, he concluded that s 47B applied to Hatches Creek, and that extinguishment was therefore to be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2645">667 On appeal to the Full Court, the Northern Territory contended that no finding of occupation could be made on the basis of inference alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2646">It submitted that such a finding could only be made if there were direct evidence to support it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2647">The Full Court rejected that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2648">668 The Northern Territory submitted in the alternative that the inference that his Honour drew was insufficiently supported by the primary facts, as found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2649">That submission too was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2650">669 The Full Court had this to say about the meaning of the term "occupation" in the context of s 47B (at [193]-[196]):
 
 "The requirement of occupation in s 47A of the NT Act , which is the same as that in s 47B , was considered by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FC 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2651">Their Honours considered that a broad view should be taken of the word (at [449]): 
 
 
 We think this requirement is met where a claimant member is one of many people who share occupancy, and that the land may be relevantly occupied even though the person is rarely present on the lands so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that person wishes to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2652">
 
 
 
 
 
 In Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409, Merkel J found the following activities to evidence occupation of an area of land for the purposes of s 47A(1)(c) of the NT Act : 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; continuing supervisory and protective activities of the senior Yawuru men in relation to the claim area; 
 &#8226; the holding of traditional ceremonies on the claim area as and when the senior lawmen authorised those activities; 
 &#8226; continued storage of sacred objects on the claim area; 
 &#8226; occupancy of the Leregon structures constructed on the claim area by members of the Lee family who are acknowledged to be members of the Rubibi claim group 
 
 
 
 
 In Passi v Queensland [2001] FCA 697 Black CJ, on a consent determination, said that although the islands the subject of that determination were not permanently inhabited the evidence showed that the Meriam people used the land as and when they wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2653">Its use was consistent with its reserved purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2654">His Honour was satisfied that the people occupied the relevant islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2655">In Daniel at [973] Nicholson J also applied what Beaumont and von Doussa JJ had said in Ward FC 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2656">He equated "connection" and "occupation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2657">
 
 As Toohey J said in Mabo (No 2 ) at 188 presence on land does not have to be possession at law to amount to occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2658">He referred to United States and Canadian cases which established occupancy by reference to the demands of the land and society in question "in accordance with the way of life, habits, customs and usages of the [indigenous people] who are its users and occupiers": Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma v United States 383 F 2d 991 (1967) at 998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2659">His Honour observed in particular that "a nomadic lifestyle is not inconsistent with occupancy": (at 189).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2660">
 
 It was not disputed that Hatches Creek was part of the applicants' traditional country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2661">Nor was it suggested that there were no native title rights or interests subsisting in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2662">Given that background and the evidence of activity in its vicinity, to which he referred, his Honour was entitled to draw the conclusion that the applicants occupied it in the broad sense relevant to s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2663">His Honour cannot be said to have erred in his determination as it affected Hatches Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2664">" 
 

670 The Full Court next dealt with a submission by the Northern Territory that Mansfield J had erred by not finding that, at the time when the application was made, the area of Hatches Creek township was covered by a proclamation such that it did not fall within s 47B(1)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2665">671 The Full Court set out in some detail the history surrounding the proclamation of the Hatches Creek town site in 1953.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2666">The proclamation was made pursuant to s 111 of the Crown Lands Ordinance 1931 (NT) ("the Ordinance ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2667">That section provided that the Governor-General could, by proclamation, constitute and define the boundaries of, inter alia, new towns, and distinguish each by a name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2668">However, the proclamation of a township had no operative legal effect beyond satisfying a condition precedent for the grant of various types of leases contemplated by other provisions of the Ordinance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2669">672 The Northern Territory submitted in the appeal to the Full Court that the proclamation of Hatches Creek was a "proclamation" made "by the Crown in any capacity" within the meaning of s 47B(1)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2670">The constitution of the land as a town was said to fall within both "public purposes" and to be "a particular purpose" within that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2671">673 The Full Court noted the submissions of the respondents to the appeal regarding this issue (at [182]):
 
 "The applicants pointed out that although the Crown land within the area described had been set apart as town lands there was no evidence of any leases ever being issued in the town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2672">At the time of the application all of the land was unalienated vacant Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2673">The proclamation was said not to be in the nature of a reservation or dedication which would be expected if the use of the land for public purposes were involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2674">Nor was use of the land for a particular purpose prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2675">A town area could be used for any number of purposes by any number of people and entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2676">As the Hatches Creek case illustrated, the mere fact that an area was constituted as a town, its boundaries defined and the land within it set apart as town lands did not mean that the land would be used for any purpose, let alone a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2677">The constitution of a town with defined boundaries might have consequences for local government administrative powers but it had no direct effect on land ownership or existing tenures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2678">Nor did the constitution of a town mean that lands within the area so constituted would be used either for public or private purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2679">On this basis it was submitted that the effect of the proclamation was not to provide that any identified area was to be used for a public purpose or for a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2680">" 
 

674 The Full Court went on to say (at [185]-[187]): 
 
 "The operation of s 47B(1)(b)(ii) falls to be considered at the time the application for a native title determination is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2681">The collocation "reservation, proclamation, dedication etc" is of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2682">There is no doubt that the proclamation made on 22 July 1953 was a "proclamation" within the meaning of s 47B(1)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2683">To satisfy the exclusionary condition in that subparagraph however the proclamation had to be one of which it could be said that, at the date of the application, it was a proclamation "under which the whole or a part of the land ... in the area is to be used for public purposes or a particular purpose".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2684">The terms of the condition raises two issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2685">The first is as to the nature of the purposes for which the land is to be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2686">The second is whether an intention to use the land for those purposes must be shown, as a matter of fact, to exist at the time the native title determination application is made or whether it is to be ascertained by reference to the terms of the proclamation and the legislation under which it is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2687">
 
 The definition of a townsite and the setting aside of land within the townsite as "town lands" under the Crown Lands Ordinance embraced a variety of potential subsequent uses none of which was defined at the point of proclamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2688">The proclamation enlivened powers to grant leases for a variety of purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2689">
 
 The purpose of s 47B is beneficial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2690">The qualification on its application in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) is no doubt intended to minimise the impact of native title determination applications on areas set aside by proclamation or otherwise under statutory authority for public or particular purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2691">That limitation should not be construed more widely than is necessary to achieve its purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2692">A proclamation for a broadly expressed purpose which encompasses a variety of potential but unascertained uses is not a proclamation for a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2693">The term "public purposes" may arguably encompass a land use planning purpose which is met by establishing a framework or condition for the allocation of private rights such as the grant of residential or commercial leases in a township.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2694">Alternatively, it may be construed as referring to purposes of a public nature such as the creation of reserves for public works or recreation or environmental protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2695">A narrower construction accords with a comprehensible policy that, in the public interest, prior extinguishment which might obviate public exposure to compensation claims or a future act process should be continued in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2696">It is not necessary in aid of the narrower construction to define its outer limits here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2697">It is sufficient to say that the mere proclamation of a townsite, which might comprise largely private property holdings by lease or otherwise, does not define public purposes or a particular purpose within the meaning of s 47B(1)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2698">" 
 

675 Finally, the Full Court considered the meaning to be given to the expression "is to be used" in s 47B(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2699">It said (at [188]-[189]):
 
 "The second constructional question turns on the requirement that to attract the exemption from the operation of s 47B the proclamation must be one under which the land or waters which it covers "is to be used" for the specified purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2700">The words "is to be used" import the need to identify some intention to use the subject land for the requisite purpose or purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2701">The question that arises is whether that intention is to be gleaned by reference to the terms of the proclamation and its constating legislation as an intention fixed for the duration of the proclamation or whether it is to be ascertained as a matter of fact at the time of the application for a native title determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2702">The evidence suggests that there is little or no prospect of the Hatches Creek townsite ever becoming a town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2703">The proclamation is in effect a dead letter even though it was said by the Northern Territory to have the effect of defeating the beneficial operation of s 47B in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2704">Nevertheless although the first interpretation can yield artificial results, it does provide an objective basis for determining the question of the imputed intention associated with the proclamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2705">The alternative approach would require factual inquiry into whether there has been, at the time of the application, an effective abandonment, attributable to the Crown, of any intention to implement the proposed purposes of the proclamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2706">The latter construction is not to be preferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2707">
 
 There was evidence of a public plan prepared for the Hatches Creek townsite in 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2708">The plan showed provision for a recreation area, government offices, tennis courts, a school site and what appear to be residential lots and roads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2709">There is no suggestion that this plan had any statutory significance or legal effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2710">The Northern Territory could not point to evidence about its provenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2711">It does not impact upon the characterisation of the proclamation for the purposes of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2712">" 
 

676 It followed that each of the Northern Territory's contentions regarding the applicability of s 47B was rejected .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2713">
 Submissions and Conclusions in relation to s 47B 
 
677 The factual matrix under which s 47B must be considered in the present case differs somewhat from that which applied in Alyawarr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2714">The proclamation constituting and defining the boundaries of Timber Creek, and setting aside Crown lands within the town boundaries so declared as town lands, was dated 10 May 1975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2715">It was made under s 111 of the Ordinance , the same provision that authorised the proclamation of Hatches Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2716">The Timber Creek proclamation was published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette on 10 June 1975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2717">678 As the Full Court noted in Alyawarr , judges at first instance have differed on the application of s 47B to areas within the boundaries of towns constituted by proclamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2718">In Hayes, Olney J was content to apply the section to unalienated and unreserved Crown land in the town of Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2719">In Daniel, however, RD Nicholson J observed that the section would not apply to the town site of Karratha because the proclamation of a site for a town would involve "a public purpose", as well as "a particular purpose".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2720">However, because there was no claim to the town site in Daniel (which was, in any event, covered by a reserve) his Honour's comments regarding s 47B were dicta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2721">679 The claimants submitted before me that s 47B applied to Timber Creek because the area in relation to which the claimant application was made was not (as required by s 47B(1)(b)(ii)) covered by a "proclamation ... under which the whole or a part of the land or waters is to be used for public purposes or for a particular purpose".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2722">They argued that, as in Alyawarr, the constitution of an area as a town and the designation of Crown lands within that area as "town lands" did not give rise, in any relevant sense, to any "use" (whether intended, proposed or actual) of any part of the land or waters within the area for any purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2723">680 The claimants submitted that the Timber Creek proclamation did two things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2724">First, it constituted the town of Timber Creek by identifying the boundaries for the new town, within which there would be both Crown land, and private land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2725">Next, it set apart Crown lands within those boundaries as town lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2726">That submission followed the structure of the enabling power, as discussed in Alyawarr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2727">681 It was next submitted that the bare proclamation of a town could hardly be characterised as having a "purpose", at least as that term was used in s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2728">The argument was that the making of a proclamation, pursuant to the statutory framework within which the power to do so was found, made it clear that the mere declaration of an area as a town, or the designation of Crown lands in the declared area as town lands, did not mean that the declared area, or the designated Crown lands, were to be used for any public purposes, or any particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2729">682 The claimants submitted that s 47B is, as its title suggests, concerned with vacant Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2730">As the Attorney-General observed in the second reading speech when the section was introduced, it was designed to: 
 
 "...enable indigenous people who are in occupation of an area where there are no longer any competing third party rights to claim native title and have the court disregard the tenure history of the area in determining that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2731">" 
 

683 This submission was supported by reference to the history of Crown lands legislation in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2732">It was submitted that the exception to s 47B found in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) was plainly directed to the problem identified by the majority in Ward HC in relation to the reservation and dedication of Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2733">It was submitted that their Honours had provided an explanation for the scope of the exception (at [209]-[261]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2734">684 It was next submitted that the expression "is to be used" had to be given some meaningful operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2735">That expression implied a form of vesting control and management in reserve land, or some act by which the Crown has bound itself in some way to keep land for public use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2736">Merely identifying an area of the town, and setting apart Crown land within that area as "town lands", was not comprehended by the exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2737">685 Finally, the claimants submitted that the requirement in s 47B(1)(c) that one or more members of the native title claim group "occupy the area" at the time the application for a determination of native title is made was readily satisfied in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2738">Indeed, it was submitted that the evidence in support of "occupation" was far stronger in this case than the evidence led in relation to that issue in respect of Hatches Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2739">Unlike the position in Alyawarr , there was unchallenged evidence before me that a significant number of members of the native title claim group resided in Timber Creek, or at least within its immediate vicinity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2740">There was also unchallenged evidence that members of the native title claim group have used, and continue to use the land and waters within the claim area for traditional purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2741">The claimants referred to the evidence of Lorraine Jones, and particularly her evidence regarding bush tucker in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2742">They also noted that a number of sacred sites are located within Timber Creek itself, and that those sites are continually visited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2743">In Hayes , Olney J held that evidence of this kind was itself sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 47B(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2744">686 The Northern Territory responded by noting that the lots claimed in the present proceeding all lie within Timber Creek, a town declared by proclamation in 1975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2745">It submitted that by virtue of that proclamation, s 47B could not be invoked to cause acts of extinguishment to be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2746">687 The Northern Territory's argument focused upon the structure of s 47, and the provisions that immediately follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2747">688 In broad terms, s 47 provides for prior extinguishment to be disregarded in relation to pastoral leases held by native title applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2748">689 Section 47A provides for prior extinguishment to be disregarded in relation to freehold estates and leases vested under legislation for the benefit of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders, provided that at the time the application for a native title determination is made, members of the native title claim group occupy the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2749">690 Section 47B is simply the analogue of s 47A, but directed towards vacant Crown land occupied, at the time of the application, by members of the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2750">See generally: Strickland v Native Title Registrar (1999) 168 ALR 242 at [54] per French J, cited with apparent approval by Merkel J in Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 1019 ; (2004) 138 FCR 536 at [1] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2751">691 Section 47 was contained in the original Native Title Act as enacted in 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2752">Sections 47A and 47B , along with many other amendments, came into effect on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2753">Like s 47 , these provisions require certain acts of extinguishment to be "disregarded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2754">These amendments were introduced, in part, as a response to Wik .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2755">That case revealed the anomalous situation that could occur if aboriginal people have been living in a particular area for some time, but could not obtain a determination of native title because of some extinguishing event that may have occurred only briefly, and a long time ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2756">As a result, since the 1998 amendments, claims can be made to, and determinations of native title made in respect of, areas which were formerly the subject of a "previous exclusive possession act".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2757">Such an act would ordinarily have extinguished native title, but for the operation of ss 47 , 47A or 47B .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2758">692 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 included under the heading "Provisions relating to certain reserves or vacant Crown land" the following statement in relation to s 47B: 
 
 "5.56 Section 47B is a statutory mechanism designed to allow native title claimants who are in occupation of vacant Crown land to overcome the effect of past extinguishment and have their claim determined by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2759">The current section 47 allows a claim for pastoral lease land, notwithstanding past extinguishment, where the claimants hold the pastoral lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2760">This provision will allow a claim for vacant Crown land where the claimants are in occupation of that land, notwithstanding possible extinguishment by any historical act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2761">" 
 

693 The Explanatory Memorandum recognised that the amendment followed a recommendation of the Majority Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title that:
 
 "Governments should deal sensitively and on a case by case basis with those situations where indigenous people continue to live on reserves but are unable to register native title applications" 
 

694 It was submitted that in referring to "a reservation, proclamation, dedication, condition, permission or authority" in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) , the legislature intended to cast a wide net to capture the various different mechanisms or terminologies used in connection with executive acts or legislation, by which Crown land was designated to be used for public purposes or for a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2762">Counsel focussed upon the word "under" in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) as meaning "in pursuance of" or "under the authority of", the same meaning given to that word in s 3 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2763">695 It was further submitted that the word "used" in s 47B(1)(b)(ii) was a word of wide ambit, whose meaning was to be distilled from context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2764">It was submitted that, by proclamation (and by declaration), the land in question in these proceedings had been set apart as the site for a town to be called the Town of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2765">By making that proclamation (and declaration) the Crown had indicated the intended "use" of the area as a town.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2766">696 Turning to the phrase "for public purposes" it was submitted that this too was an expression of wide ambit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2767">It would be sufficient if the purpose which was designated was one which benefited a select group or groups, in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2768">The Northern Territory relied upon Attorney-General (NSW) v Homebush Flour Mills Ltd [1937] HCA 3 ; (1937) 56 CLR 390 (at 412-3) and Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v Commonwealth [1993] HCA 10 ; (1993) 176 CLR 480 (at 505) as support for that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2769">697 Finally, with regard to the expression "for a particular purpose", the Northern Territory submitted that this meant nothing more than a purpose that was definite, rather than one that was indeterminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2770">698 The Northern Territory supported these submissions by reference to a number of observations by RD Nicholson J in Daniel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2771">As previously indicated, in that case his Honour considered that s 47B would have no application within the defined boundaries of a town site which had been set apart by declaration for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2772">699 Counsel for the Northern Territory did not have the benefit of the considered views of the Full Court in Alyawarr at the time these submissions were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2773">Plainly, they are at odds with the reasoning of the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2774">As previously mentioned, Alyawarr was the subject of an unsuccessful application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2775">Hayne J described the reasoning of the Full Court as "not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of special leave to appeal to this Court".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2776">700 I am of course bound by the decision of the Full Court in Alyawarr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2777">As I was a member of that Full Court, it is hardly surprising that I regard the decision as correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2778">To the extent that Daniel reflects a different approach to the construction of s 47B, I must respectfully decline to follow that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2779">It follows that s 47B(1)(b)(ii) is no impediment to the operation of s 47B in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2780">701 Another point raised by the Northern Territory with regard to s 47B concerned the scope of any benefit that might be claimed in reliance upon that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2781">It should be noted that, for reasons that will be discussed later, the claimants do not rely upon that section in relation to Lots 16, 22, 33, 35 and 37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2782">702 The Northern Territory also challenged the claim that one or more members of the native title claim group "occupied" the specific lots identified as making up the claim area at the time each of the three applications presently before the Court was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2783">It submitted that it is was not sufficient simply to state, as the claimants had done, that "occupation" was established on the basis of residence in, or near, Timber Creek, and that some (unidentified) land was used for traditional purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2784">It submitted that the fact that sacred sites may be located within the township in no way altered that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2785">703 In my view, the claimants have clearly established that when the present applications were made, one or more members of the native title claim group "occupied" the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2786">I adopt what Olney J said in Hayes in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2787">Accordingly, I find that s 47B(1)(c) is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2788">704 As previously indicated, there is no dispute that the requirements of s 47B(1)(b)(i) and (iii) are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2789">705 It follows that, subject to the lots identified in [701] of these reasons for judgment, any extinguishment brought about by pastoral leases in relation to the claim area is to be disregar ded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2790">706 It also follows that it is not necessary to determine whether any such extinguishment, brought about by pastoral leases, if it did operate, would do so by extinguishing native title rights and interests in their entirety, or whether it would do so merely by extinguishing them in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2791">NATURE AND EXTENT OF NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS 
 
707 This does not absolve me of the duty, pursuant to s 225, of determining the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2792">In particular, I am required to determine whether those native title rights and interests are what is sometimes characterised as "exclusive" or whether they take some lesser, "non-exclusive" form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2793">708 Ward HC held that native title should be characterised as a "bundle of rights" rather than an underlying "title to land".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2794">In other words, it should be seen as a bundle of separate and separable, distinct rights and interests that can be exercised in relation to a particular area (and also extinguished separately and distinctly).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2795">Thus, the legal recognition of native title gives native title holders the right to exercise the particular rights that are proved, and no others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2796">709 In a given case, those rights may include rights to hunt and fish, conduct ceremonies, take water and so forth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2797">In other words, the rights may be essentially usufructuary in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2798">710 By contrast, "title to land", had that been the approach endorsed in Ward HC, would see native title as a right to the land itself, and would regard recognition of native title as giving the holders something akin to exclusive use and occupation of the land, and then simply as a normal incident of such title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2799">711 There is plainly scope for some rights, within the "bundle of rights" that constitutes native title, to be of a proprietary character, while others are personal, and do not entail any capacity to enforce those rights against third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2800">It should of course be understood that many text writers regard the division between proprietary and personal interests as being grounded in the fact that the holder of a proprietary interest can enforce it against a person other than the grantor of the interest, whereas the holder of a personal interest can enforce it only against the grantor of that interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2801">See, for example DC Jackson, " Principles of Property Law " (1967) at 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2802">712 It is necessary to consider the claimants' evidence in its entirety, and to determine whether it establishes as an incident of their native title rights and interests, a right not merely to use and enjoy the land in traditional ways, but also a general right to exclude others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2803">If a right of that character exists, the native title rights and interests in this case would be relevantly "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2804">713 In some instances, native title claimants have succeeded in demonstrating a right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the claim area to the exclusion of all others .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2805">On other occasions, native title has been found to exist, but it has not been of an "exclusive" kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2806">The rights in question have been held to be personal, and largely usufructuary in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2807">714 As I have already indicated, the evidence in the present case goes no further, in my view, than to establish that the claimants have been asked, on occasion, by other indigenous people wishing to come upon their land for "permission" to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2808">The evidence is somewhat obscure, but suggests that these requests are made as a matter of prudence, because visitors would be at risk if they were simply to go upon the land without seeking permission, and without obtaining guidance and assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2809">715 The ongoing normative system regarding relationship to country that the evidence before me discloses does not fit the template of a right to possess "to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2810">Nor does it suggest a general right to "control access" to the land in any relevantly proprietorial sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2811">In reality, the claimants seem to me to assert a right, under their traditional laws and customs, to be consulted about matters that might harm the land, and a right to veto any activity which might be detrimental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2812">This falls well short of the broader claim that is pleaded, to possess the land to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2813">716 It follows that, subject to what I will shortly say regarding the special position of the waters of the Creek itself, the determination of native title that I will ultimately make will be essentially in the form of a declaration that the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples hold native title, and that the incidents of that title include various rights in relation to the claim area that are "non-exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2814">I will not declare that these rights can be exercised to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2815">717 The claimants have clearly established that they are entitled to a determination of native title that specifies rights of a usufructuary nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2816">These include the right to hunt and forage in or on the land, and the right to fish in the waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2817">They also include the right to engage in rituals and ceremonies upon the land, and to be appropriately consulted about, and protect particular sites located within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2818">These rights do not operate "to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2819">However, in the case of ritual and ceremonial practices, they may entail some limited rights to control access to the particular area being used while these activities take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2820">718 My findings in this regard are intended to accord with the approach taken by the Full Court in A-G (NT) v Ward .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2821">As previously indicated, that was a consent determination in relation to the Miriuwung Gajerrong native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2822">In that case the Full Court made orders that non-exclusive rights and interests could not include a right to "occupy" the land in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2823">719 My findings are also intended to accord with the approach taken by the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2824">There the Full Court, having earlier concluded that the trial judge had erred in finding that native title did not exist in the claim area, held that the native title rights and interests in that area were non-exclusive rights to use and enjoy the land and waters in accordance with traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2825">720 Likewise, my findings are intended to accord with the approach taken by the Full Court in Alyawarr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2826">There the Court affirmed the existence of native title rights over the Hatches Creek "town" area, but rejected a right to control access where possession and occupation were not exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2827">The Full Court also rejected findings by the primary judge that the right to trade existed as a distinct native title right, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence of a right of that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2828">Finally, it held that the right to control the disclosure of spiritual beliefs and practices should be excised from the determination because it was not a right in relation to land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2829">THE SPECIAL POSITION OF THE WATERS OF TIMBER CREEK 
 
721 For reasons that will soon become apparent, the claimants' position regarding the waters of Timber Creek is somewhat obscure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2830">This issue is contentious, given the importance that AFANT places upon preserving access to those waters so that its members can continue to enjoy their long standing pastime of recreational fishing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2831">722 There is a preliminary question to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2832">The claimants say that although they expressly abandoned their claim to native title over the waters of Victoria River prior to the commencement of this trial, they have at all times maintained their claim to native title over the bed and banks of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2833">The only exception to that claim which they arguably acknowledge (and even this is uncertain) is the small section of the Creek that is tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2834">On one view, they accept that native title cannot be claimed over tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2835">723 The Northern Territory and AFANT on the other hand contend that during the course of closing submissions the claimants, through their counsel, abandoned any claim to native title over the non-tidal waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2836">They say that the claimants should not now be permitted to re-agitate that claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2837">724 It is necessary therefore to give consideration to both the oral and written submissions made on behalf of the claimants during the course of senior counsel's closing submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2838">725 In his written submission, senior counsel for the claimants noted that the portion of the Victoria River that was originally within the claim area was withdrawn from the claim on 7 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2839">He made no mention of any similar concession in relation to the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2840">726 The written submission went on to say that the first two applications (numbers D6016 of 1999 and D6008 of 2000) had been filed in response to a proposed compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of private development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2841">Those applications covered only the portions of land subject to the proposed compulsory acquisition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2842">The third application (number D6012 of 2000) was said to cover:
 
 "... all other claimable land within the town boundary of Timber Creek, and which is vacant and predominately undeveloped crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2843">" 


No mention was made at this point of the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2844">727 The written submission next said:
 
 "In this matter the Applicants claim not only that native title exists in relation to certain crown land located within the town boundary of Timber Creek, but that the native title rights and interests are exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2845">" 
 

728 There then followed a number of paragraphs which dealt at some length with the evidence of Dr Palmer and Ms Asche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2846">These paragraphs discussed various matters such as the system of descent that has prevailed in the claim area, recruitment to the "country group", membership of the claimant community, language, the spiritual relationship to country, Professor Sansom's thesis, the shift from patrilineality to cognation, the reliability of oral accounts, and the on-site evidence adduced in support of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2847">729 Paragraph 80 is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2848">It refers to the evidence adduced on behalf of AFANT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2849">That paragraph reads as follows:
 
 "Apart from expert evidence only the third respondent tendered evidence, which rather than contradict the Applicant's evidence, gave an account of the use of the Victoria River and Timber Creek by members of AFANT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2850">Very little of the third respondent's statements are of direct relevance to the amended claim area following the removal of the Victoria River from the claim area on 7 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2851">Generally the picture obtained from the statements that is of relevance to the claim area is confined to the use of the mouth of Timber Creek (which we say is tidal) and those areas of Timber Creek behind the police station and the caravan park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2852">" 
 

730 This paragraph seems to me to suggest a continuing intention on the part of the claimants to assert a right to native title in relation to the non-tidal waters of the Creek, away from its mouth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2853">However, the point is not spelt out with any precision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2854">731 After a detailed analysis of the general principles governing native title, and a recapitulation of the evidence regarding the laws and customs of the claimant group, there are references in paragraphs 126 to 130, and in paragraph 133 to ties with "land and waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2855">There is then a discussion of the effect of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2856">732 Towards the end of the written submission paragraph 179 is in the following terms:
 
 "In summary, we say there are 5 lots (Lots 16, 22, 33, 35 and 37) that may be subject to previous acts that affect native title and are precluded from the benefit of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2857">Otherwise the remaining lots claimed are vacant crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2858">" 
 

733 It can be seen that the written submission filed on behalf of the claimants pays scant regard to any native title rights involving the actual waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2859">734 The order of oral submissions had counsel for AFANT addressing the Court before senior counsel for the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2860">Not surprisingly, counsel for AFANT focussed almost exclusively upon what he understood to be an extant claim to native title over the non-tidal waters of the Creek, and its bed and banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2861">He submitted that even if some form of native title were found to exist in relation to those waters, his client's members should not be prevented from continuing to engage in their favourite pastime of recreational fishing in the waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2862">He drew no distinction, in that regard, between tidal and non-tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2863">735 When senior counsel for the claimants commenced his oral submissions, I raised with him his clients' attitude to the submission that had been made on behalf of AFANT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2864">His immediate response was that none of the amateur fishermen, whether members of AFANT or not, had any right to fish in, and around, the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2865">The fact that amateur fishermen had engaged in this pastime for many years was of no consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2866">All that AFANT could reasonably submit was that the evidence did not support a finding that the claimants had exclusive possession of the bed and banks, as alleged by them in the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2867">736 Senior counsel reminded me that at the point at which we had crossed the Creek heading from west to east during the course of the onsite hearings the water could be seen to be flowing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2868">However, at other points, the water had been still.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2869">He acknowledged that at the confluence of the Victoria River and the Creek, the waters were tidal, and that Yarmirr had determined that there could be no native title right to exclusive possession over tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2870">737 Senior counsel then submitted that if a creek flowed through an area over which the claimants had exclusive rights, it would follow that they had exclusive rights to the bed and banks of that creek as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2871">He then indicated that he had arranged for his junior to conduct some urgent research in order to ascertain what the leading authorities dealing with native title had to say about "the notion of flowing water".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2872">738 After a short break, senior counsel indicated that he could find no authority dealing specifically with this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2873">However, he did refer to several consent determinations in which there had been some reference to tidal waters in the context of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2874">739 The discussion ended at that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2875">The following day I returned to the question of access by amateur fishermen to the waters of the Creek and asked whether, on the claimants' case, their native title rights extended to closing off any fishing by anyone in those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2876">Shortly thereafter, I again asked senior counsel whether he wished to say anything further about the tidal waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2877">The transcript is instructive:
 
 "HIS HONOUR: Do you want to say anything further about flowing waters, running waters, or tidal waters?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2878">
 
 MR PARSONS: I just turned to the Control of Waters Act, and Sites in Water, and so forth, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2879">No, your Honour, as my learned junior reminds me, our claim doesn't extend to waters of any kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2880">
 
 HIS HONOUR: I thought it extended to Timber Creek?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2881">
 
 MR PARSONS: To its beds and banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2882">We don't make a claim to the running waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2883">
 
 HIS HONOUR: I see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2884">
 
 MR PARSONS: If that's of assistance to your Honour, and my learned friends, and my instructions that we make no claim to running waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2885">
 
 HIS HONOUR: I misunderstood, because I had assumed that you had originally made a claim to go for the Victoria River and Timber Creek, but you abandoned the claim in relation to Victoria River, but that you maintained a claim in relation to Timber Creek, then in your submissions, you excluded from the claim that part of Timber Creek that involved, on the evidence, tidal water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2886">
 
 MR PARSONS: Tidal water, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2887">
 
 HIS HONOUR: And in fact, we had a long dialogue with Mr Johnson yesterday about precisely that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2888">Is this a new position you've taken, Mr Parsons?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2889">I mean, have you reflected on the matter, or is it -?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2890">We've wasted a lot of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2891">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, I think perhaps we ought to - I understand your Honour's - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: You might get some instructions over lunch?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2892">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, I'll get those instructions again, your Honour, but I indeed perhaps ought to talk to - yes, indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2893">We'll talk a bit further about that, and I'll be much clearer about that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2894">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Mr Johnson, are you taken by surprise by what Mr Parson's is saying?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2895">
 
 MR JOHNSON: Rather, your Honour, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2896">I just noticed - my junior is actually just checking, and noticed the application refers to the - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: It might need an amendment to the application, and the proposed determination, if you are now abandoning any - - - 
 
 MR JOHNSON: Sorry, "to the land and waters" was actually what was in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2897">
 
 HIS HONOUR: You'd better have a think about this over lunch, Mr Parsons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2898">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, I'm sorry, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2899">In fact, I did have the application that my learned junior is reminding me, yes, the claim I think here refers to as Timber Creek and its beds and banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2900">So, yes, I do apologise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2901">Of course, I've moved on a bit, but anyway, we ought to --- I'll talk to - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Well, reflect on that over lunch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2902">We'll resume at 2.15, and 
 you can tell me what your final position with regard to the actual waters at Timber Creek is, and do any final tidying up that you might wish to do, and then I'll hear from Ms Webb and Mr Johnson, if necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2903">
 
 MR PARSONS: Thank you, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2904">
 
 HIS HONOUR: In Mr Johnson's case, if you abandon Timber Creek, I suspect he won't have very much to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2905">I might be wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2906">Alright, we'll adjourn until a quarter past two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2907">" 
 

740 After the luncheon break, senior counsel returned to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2908">The transcript reads as follows:
 
 MR PARSONS: "I've sought instructions over lunch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2909">My instructions are, your Honour, that we've never sought by claiming the Timber Creek, and its beds and banks, to maintain a claim of exclusivity to the H 2 O.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2910">Now, the reason for that is - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Normally, when there's a - when somebody says they have property over a creek or river or whatever, what they really mean is they have property over the land that's underneath the flowing water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2911">That's the historical, common law view of the matter, isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2912">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, I understand so, and more particularly, the reason --- Mr Levy instructs that this is a matter that's been agitated for some time, that in fact, Ward, in the, I think, certainly the Full Court, probably the High Court, the Full Court judgment, talked of the Ord River above the dam, which is demonstrably not tidal, but found in respect of it non-exclusive Native Title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2913">So we would - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: What's the content of those rights?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2914">
 
 MR PARSONS: I presume there would be rights to - frankly, I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2915">I mean, it's in the - I would only be guessing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2916">
 
 HIS HONOUR: But how do they differ from anybody else's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2917">
 
 MR PARSONS: The rights to the H 2 O don't differ from any one else's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2918">I think that's the essential point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2919">
 
 HIS HONOUR: In other words, the right to fish is the same right to fish that everyone's got.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2920">
 
 MR PARSONS: I believe so, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2921">
 
 HIS HONOUR: There's no right to stop anybody else from fishing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2922">
 
 MR PARSONS: There is no right to prevent any one else from fishing, that is there's no claim of an exclusive right in the H 2 O by the Native Title applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2923">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Well, what is the claim in relation to Timber Creek?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2924">
 
 MR PARSONS: So, the Timber Creek claim is to the beds and banks of the river, the exclusive rights in effect of that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2925">And to the - those rights to the H 2 0, which would include the harvesting of fish, the drinking water - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Do you mean fishing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2926">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, fishing, drinking, using it - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: But they're no different to anybody else's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2927">
 
 MR PARSONS: They're using it for ceremonial purposes - no, in the sense that it's using the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2928">No, I can't see - I mean, we can use it for - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: I just don't understand this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2929">I'm sorry, Mr Parsons, I'm trying to understand it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2930">I'm required under the Act to identify the nature and kind and extent of Native Title interests that you claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2931">I don't understand what you're claiming in relation to the H 2 O, as it were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2932">
 
 MR PARSONS: I suspect the answer is, your Honour, nothing more than that which we already have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2933">
 
 HIS HONOUR: What do you already have?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2934">
 
 MR PARSONS: The rights of any other person to use the waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2935">
 
 HIS HONOUR: So, you want to be treated like everybody else?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2936">
 
 MR PARSONS: Well, your Honour, can I answer in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2937">What I haven't got access to at the moment is what, in fact, the formulation of words by the, I presume, the Full Court in Ward were with respect to the Native Title rights in the Ord River above the dam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2938">
 
 HIS HONOUR: But whatever they were, you want?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2939">
 
 MR PARSONS: Yes, indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2940">And - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Assuming they're different from what everybody else can do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2941">
 
 MR PARSONS: Indeed, if there's anything other than that which is precisely that which everybody else can do, then, yes, that's what we claim, but the difficulty I have is that, as Mr Levy tells me over lunch, not only is it the Ward Full Court judgment in respect to that particular river, there's also apparently a recent determination in front of your Honour, and the rest of the Full Court in Ward with respect to the Keep River, which is also a similar determination, and there's also another judgment of - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Consent determinations fall into a different category, don't they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2942">
 
 MR PARSONS: Indeed, indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2943">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Because, although one has to be satisfied that the statutory criteria are met, there's no debate about any of the issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2944">There's no dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2945">There's no evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2946">There's nothing to worry about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2947">
 
 MR PARSONS: Sorry, I understand that was simply doing nothing more than taking up that which was, by law, permitted by the first judgment, so the answer to my problem, I'm sorry, your Honour, is in that judgment.</sentence>

 HIS HONOUR: Why don't I give you the chance to reflect on that aspect a little bit further, and you can, when you've thought about, and looked at any cases and so forth, let counsel for the other side have a short note, and let me have a note about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2949">
 
 MR PARSONS: Most grateful for that indulgence, your Honour, and we'll certainly take that up, and can I just - two other matters that occurred to me over lunch is, in the judgment of Justice Selway in Gumana, the Blue Mud Bay case, His Honour spoke in paragraph 70, and paragraph 185 of the rights of access to free flowing water, birds and fish and so forth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2950">
 
 So, His Honour actually talks in there - and I've just been referred to these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2951">Perhaps if I can read it, it might be of some assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2952">Again, I'm grateful to your Honour's invitation, and I'll certainly take up, but for example, His Honour said in paragraph 70: 
 
 
 
 If Land Rights Act did confer upon the applicants the power to exclude from the intertidal zone, that right would not include the ownership of the water or of the fish within it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2953">In the ordinary course a grant (including statutory grant) over an area of land includes the right to the exclusive use of the air space above it, and the land below it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2954">See Thomas reference, and see noted the law journal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2955">But this does not mean that the owner of the land owns everything physically on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2956">In the normal course, a person cannot sensibly be said to own free flowing water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2957">What the owner has is a right to control access to that water, and to use it for his or her own purposes, similarly in relation to fish and other ferae naturae, Goodman reference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2958">
 
 
 
 So, yes, indeed, we'll take your Honour's invitation up that we can see that Justice Selway had examined issues of relevance, and I'm sorry we have to detain your Honour further, but given we're going to in any event set up the two - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: I really would like this question of the precise nature of the claim, if any, to Timber Creek, be clarified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2959">At the moment, I'm a state of confusion about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2960">
 
 MR PARSONS: Indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2961">
 
 HIS HONOUR: So if it's to be abandoned, then there should be an amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2962">If it's not to be abandoned, then I need to know exactly what you say the incidents of the right in question are.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2963">
 
 MR PARSONS: Indeed, and just so that the fundamental approach of the Land Council is clear, those instructing me, is that they're not seeking to challenge the - or set that aspect of it up as test case in any other way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2964">It's doing nothing other than complying with the law as we apparently understand it from Ward, so what we need to do is establish that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2965">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Do I understand from what you've said also that your clients have no intention whatsoever of preventing, or placing limitations upon, those who fish in and around Timber Creek from continuing to do so, or is that not their position?</sentence>
<sentence id="s2966">
 
 MR PARSONS: That would be exceeding my instructions, I think, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2967">I simply don't have instructions as to those who fish there, and what, if anything, my clients say about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2968">I'm just not in that position to be instructed about it, and I think in the normal course, I think these things would be worked out over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2969">
 
 HIS HONOUR: Alright, thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2970">" 
 

741 It seems plain from the transcript that senior counsel for the claimants was somewhat uncertain as to precisely what his clients' position was regarding the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2971">That is regrettable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2972">It is clear that both senior counsel for the Northern Territory, and counsel for AFANT understood Mr Parsons to have resiled entirely from any claim to the waters of Timber Creek that would have enabled his clients to prevent access to those waters by anyone seeking to fish in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2973">It seemed to them, and it seemed to me as well, that the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters, which had featured heavily in the earlier submissions, had been all but abandoned, and that the claimants were now no longer certain of their true position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2974">742 The next step in this unfortunate saga was the filing of further written submissions by the claimants regarding what they described as "the non-tidal waters" of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2975">Curiously, it took some four and a half months for those further submissions to be filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2976">They were prepared by counsel other than Mr Parsons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2977">The author of those submissions had not been participated in the trial of these proceedings and, it may be inferred, was retained in order to carry out this specific task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2978">743 The further written submissions are dated 13 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2979">They are lengthy, and prolix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2980">They range over a number of matters, some of which were not the subject of evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2981">They also raise a number of issues that had not previously been addressed in oral or written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2982">744 Put simply, the further written submissions contend that the position taken by the respondents, that the existence of riparian rights in others in relation to the flowing waters of a river, stream or creek precludes recognition of a native title right to exclusive possession, cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2983">745 After a short excursus into Blackstone's treatment of riparian rights, the further written submissions seek to resile from any concession that Mr Parsons may have made that no native title rights to exclusive possession can be maintained over flowing water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2984">The submissions then introduce into the case a discussion of the effects of statutory intervention in relation to rights in water, ranging back to the Control of Waters Ordinance 1938 (NT) and the Water Act 1992 (NT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2985">It goes without saying that none of this legislative material had been referred to, in any significant degree, during the course of oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2986">746 The further written submissions argue that the respondents' case assumes the existence of riparian rights in others, as had been the case in Yarmirr .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2987">These riparian rights derive from common law, and encompass both rights to fish, and rights to navigate the sea freely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2988">According to the respondents, such rights are inconsistent with any possible native title right to control access to the tidal waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2989">747 The further written submissions challenge this contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2990">They argue that, for the claimants' native title rights to be affected by the riparian rights of others, there first have to be riparian owners, whether upstream or downstream, in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2991">They say, correctly, that there is no evidence of the existence of any such owners in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2992">For that reason, they contend that the Court can, and should, find that the claimants have exclusive rights to the waters of the Creek, both tidal and non-tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2993">748 The further written submissions then argue that any acts of extinguishment arising out of past pastoral leases should be disregarded in relation to the waters of the Creek by reason of the operation of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2994">749 They next deal with an argument put on behalf of the respondents that the public right to fish (and, it might be said, freely to navigate tidal waters) precludes recognition of a native title right to exclusive possession over at least that part of the Creek that is tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2995">Indeed, they go further, and challenge the very existence of a public right to fish in tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2996">750 The further written submissions refer to Gumana (at [61]-[69]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2997">In that case, the principal claim was for a determination of native title in respect of an area in and around Blue Mud Bay in northeast Arnhem Land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2998">The second claim involved a challenge to the power of the Northern Territory to issue commercial fishing licences in relation to the inter-tidal zone, and the adjacent sea within two kilometres of the low water mark of land that had been granted to the applicants under the Land Rights Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2999">751 As to these two claims, Selway J found that the applicants had a native title right of exclusive possession in relation to the "land" other than the inter-tidal zone (by which his Honour meant, in essence, tidal waters), and a "non-exclusive" native title right in relation to the sea and the inter-tidal zone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3000">Selway J followed Yarmirr , as explained in The Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 298 per Cooper J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3001">In Gawirrin Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia (No 2) [2005] FCA 1425 (" Gumana (No 2) "), Mansfield J, after the death of Selway J, gave effect to his Honour's judgment by making appropriate orders, and formulating the determination of native title consequent upon Selway J's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3002">752 The further written submissions filed in the present case append a copy of the applicants' written submissions in Gumana .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3003">Those Gumana submissions contain what purports to be a general account of the common law, including a reference to the significance, or otherwise, of the restraint in Magna Carta on the King's writ of defensione riparia as being somehow connected to the protection given to rights to fish as a constraint on prerogative power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3004">However, they note that in Attorney-General of British Columbia v Attorney-General of Canada [1914] AC 153, Viscount Haldane LC observed that this was perhaps "a matter of historical and antiquarian interest only".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3005">753 The further written submissions filed in these proceedings continue:
 
 
 "39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3006">In answer to both questions, however, in Attorney-General (British Columbia) v Attorney-General (Canada) Viscount Haldane LC explained that the right to navigate and the right to fish both have their origin in common practice from time immemorial to navigate the seas and to use a navigable river as a highway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3007">Thus, in Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries Brennan J, after reviewing the authorities, spoke of "the right of fishing in the sea and in tidal navigable rivers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3008">
 
 
 
 
 
 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3009">Hence, it is not correct to assume, as the respondents do, that a public right to fish applies wherever waters are tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3010">The better view is that the geographic reach of each of the right to fish and the right to navigate is one and the same, and if a body of water is not navigable, in the sense that it not the sea or an arm of the sea, it cannot be subject to a public right of fishing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3011">
 
 
 
 
 
 41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3012">When the authorities speak of a public right to fish in tidal waters of a river, the right is said to operate so far up the river as the tide in the ordinary course of things flow and reflows, and it will be a question of fact whether there is a real perceptible and sufficient ebb and flow of the tide so as to render waters tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3013">If, in the ordinary course, the tide flows and reflows, that gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the waters are navigable, and as Bayley J explained in R v Montague : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The strength of this prima facie evidence arising from the flux and reflux of the tide, must depend upon the situation and nature of the channel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3014">If it is a broad and deep channel, calculated for the purposes of commerce, it would be natural to conclude that it has been a public navigation; but if it is a petty stream, navigable only at certain periods of the tide, and then only for a very short time, and by very small boats, it is difficult to suppose that it ever has been a public navigable channel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3015">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Again, the evidence may not be conclusive as to whether any part of Timber Creek is tidal and navigable in order to decide that the common law public rights have relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3016">
 
 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3017">If it is possible to conclude that the common law rights of the public to fish and navigate have application in relation to any part of Timber Creek, on the authority of Commonwealth v Yarmirr the existence of those rights is inconsistent with the continuation of a right in the holders of native title to say who may enter the area where those rights have applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3018">
 
 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3019">On that basis, a question arises as to whether s 47B requires the consequence identified in Yarmirr to be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3020">" (footnotes omitted) 
 
 
 

754 The further written submissions conclude:
 
 "50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3021">In summary: 
 
 
 
 
 (1) The respondent's first argument that common law riparian rights afford a basis for denying recognition of a native title right to exclusive possession of a river, stream or creek does not direct one to the proper inquiry as to inconsistency between rights under traditional law and custom and other rights in respect of an area of land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3022">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) When that inquiry is undertaken, there is no relevant inconsistency between riparian rights, whether those rights arise under common law or statute, and a right under traditional law and custom to exclusive possession of a river, stream or creek but, in any event, the question does not arise on the evidence in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3023">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) Even if statutory regimes relating to the management or regulation of water resources extinguished a right under traditional law and custom to exclusive possession of a river, stream or creek, the extinguishment is of no different character to that brought about by the grant of pastoral leases, and in each case the extinguishment is required to be disregarded under s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3024">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (4) The second argument advanced by the respondents assumes the existence of common law rights of the public to fish and navigate the waters, or part of the waters, of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3025">The assumption depends on establishing that the relevant part is tidal and navigable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3026">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (5) If that assumption can be made good, a question arises whether the consequence of the inconsistency between those public rights and a right under traditional law and custom of exclusive possession in respect of that part of the Creek is required to be disregarded under s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3027">While the answer given by Selway J in Gumana v Northern Territory is that the consequence is not to be disregarded, that answer is, with respect, wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3028">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Both legal arguments advanced by the respondents must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3029">If it is accepted that the rights of the applicants under traditional law and custom include the right to be asked permission and speak for country, the determination of their native title rights may be expressed as a right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment to the exclusion of all others, and there is no basis for qualification of that right where that country includes land covered by water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3030">" 
 
 
 

755 Not surprisingly, the further written submissions were objected to in the strongest terms by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3031">The Northern Territory complained that they departed radically from the way in which the claimants had presented their case throughout these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3032">It noted that even as late as the applicants' closing submissions, senior counsel had insisted that the claimants "make no claim to running waters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3033">Indeed, he had stated even more emphatically, "we have never sought by claiming Timber Creek, and its bed and banks, to maintain a claim of exclusivity to the H 2 O".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3034">That was said to be the very antithesis of what the further written submissions now sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3035">756 Regrettably, the heated responses of the respondents led to two further lengthy submissions being filed on behalf of the claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3036">In the first, counsel denied that the claimants had in any way modified their position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3037">He said:
 
 "No claim is made for a right in flowing waters to the exclusion of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3038">What the applicants claim is a right to exclusive possession of the bed and banks on either side of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3039">That carries with it a right to control access to the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3040">" 
 

757 In the second of the two submissions, described as a "Revised Note on Draft Determination of Native Title Rights in the View of the Operation of Section 47B", counsel asserted a "right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the waters of Timber Creek to the exclusion of all others".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3041">On this occasion, he acknowledged both a public right to fish, and a right to navigate in tidal waters, which, he submitted, should be dealt with as "other interests" to which the non-extinguishment principle applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3042">758 The "Revised Note" states:
 
 " E INCIDENTS OF NATIVE TITLE: TIMBER CREEK 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3043">The applicants do not contend that they have exclusive rights in waters flowing in Timber Creek, but rather, that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) where an area of land is covered by water, and there is a right to exclusive possession of the land, no relevant qualification is, by virtue of that circumstance, required in respect of the statement of the right; and 
 
 
 
 (b) if there is a right to possession of the bed and banks on each side of Timber Creek, that carries with it a right to control access to the land and waters of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3044">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3045">The incidents of a native title right to exclusive possession of the bed and banks on each side of a waterway, or the activities that may be done under that right, are: 
 
 
 
 (a) an exclusive right to fish in non-tidal waters, and a non-exclusive right to fish in tidal waters, subject to valid regulation by laws such as the Fisheries Act 1988 (NT); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a non-exclusive right to access, take and use water subject to valid regulation by laws such as the Water Act 1992 (NT); 
 
 (c) the right to decide who else may access the waterway, subject to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the rights of members of the public to exercise rights of fishing and navigation in tidal waters, subject to valid regulation by laws such as the Fisheries Act 1988 (NT); 
 
 (ii) valid rights of access conferred on others by law, such as the power conferred on the Controller of Water Resources by s 20 of the Water Act 1992 (NT).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3046">
 
 
 
 If there is a right to exclusive possession of the bed and banks, and the proposition at 1(a) is accepted, it is not necessary to delineate what may be done under that right, and the native title rights may be expressed in the manner suggested for at A.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3047">" (Footnotes omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3048">) 
 
 
 

759 It should be noted that counsel acknowledged, in the Revised Note, that the result for which he contended would require the Court to decline to follow both Gumana , and Gumana (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3049">760 These further written submissions provoked an even lengthier, more detailed, and extremely hostile response from the Northern Territory, and a similarly terse written submission on behalf of AFANT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3050">761 The Northern Territory submitted with, I think, considerable force, that the claimants' submissions regarding native title over the waters of Timber Creek had been "dominated by confusion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3051">It pointed out that during closing submissions, Mr Parsons had initially suggested that there was now no longer any claim to the waters of Timber Creek, and that the only rights sought were those similar to those contained in the Ward "consent determination" ( A-G (NT) v Ward ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3052">That consent determination expressly eschewed any right to exclusive possession of tidal waters, and did not suggest that such a right could be gained "through the back door" by claiming exclusive possession of the bed and banks of any rivers or creeks, and the right to control access to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3053">762 That position cannot easily be reconciled with the later submissions filed on behalf of the claimants where they seemed to be asserting exclusive rights to the waters of the Creek, both tidal and non-tidal, albeit indirectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3054">763 The Northern Territory submitted that the claimants had assumed, wrongly, that a body of general evidence led in relation to their connection with, and activities upon, the land in the claim area would automatically apply to a proprietary claim to tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3055">Though the claimants had led evidence of their own fishing activities in the Victoria River (which, as has been seen, was excluded from the claim area), and of some significant sites in the waters near the mouth of the Creek itself, there was almost no evidence of any traditional law and custom that might give rise to a finding of exclusive possession of tidal water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3056">Indeed, it was submitted that this may be because the notion of property over flowing water would be as difficult to reconcile with Ngaliwurru and Nungali traditional law and custom, as it would be with the common law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3057">764 The Northern Territory's second major point in answer to the claimants' revised case regarding the waters of the Creek was that s 47B could not be called in aid in relation to those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3058">That was because the section required "occupation" of the area in relation to which the application was made as a precondition to its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3059">The Northern Territory submitted that tidal water could not be "occupied", at least in the ordinary meaning of that term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3060">765 Finally, the Northern Territory submitted that it was not a question of whether the public right to fish in, and to navigate, tidal waters brought about an "extinguishment" of native title, but rather whether the existence of such rights prevented native title from being recognised in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3061">In the absence of any indication that the rights now asserted by the claimants in relation to the tidal waters of the Creek would have been recognised by the common law of Australia, or that such rights existed at the time of sovereignty, no such rights could be recognised under the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3062">766 The Northern Territory's submission relied upon the following passage from Gumana (No 2) (at [41]-[43], per Mansfield J): 
 
 "In Attorney-General (NT) v Ward [2003] FCAFC 283 ; (2003) 134 FCR 16 at 25 ( Attorney-General (NT) v Ward ), the Full Court (Wilcox, North and Weinberg JJ) recognised that native title holders cannot obtain exclusive water rights with respect to free flowing or subterranean waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3063">Their Honours felt it appropriate to make explicit reference to water rights to avoid any possible dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3064">In this matter the applicants contend that it is unnecessary to do so given the findings in the reasons for judgment to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3065">
 
 In determining the appropriate form of determination, it is important to recognise, as his Honour intended, that the native title rights and interests over the land and inland waters, should be expressed so as to include the exclusive right to control access to water on that part of the claim area (it being contained within the claim area over which there is such an exclusive right) and to use and enjoy that water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3066">The factual issue as to the existence of such exclusive rights was ventilated by the pleadings and in the course of evidence, and resulted in the findings to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3067">
 
 In my view, his Honour's intentions as discernable from the reasons for judgment are consistent with the expression of par 4 of the applicants' proposed determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3068">It does not mean that they have some additional or unique form of right in respect of subterranean or flowing water on that part of the claim area within the defined section 'land and inland waters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3069">It means simply that, in respect of that part of the claim area they have the exclusive right to control access to the water within that part of the claim area and to use and enjoy it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3070">It is apparent from the reasons for judgment that his Honour was not seeking to create some new or additional right to 'possess' flowing or subterranean water in a way which extended beyond that recognised in other authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3071">I do not think the proposed par 4 of the proposed determination has that meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3072">The term 'the land and inland waters' is defined by par 1(a) of Schedule A as a geographical area but not in terms indicating some special and peculiar interest in the waters on that part of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3073">In my view par 4 appropriately reflects the reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3074">" 
 

767 To make the Northern Territory's position absolutely clear, it was submitted that if, contrary to its primary contention, native title were found to exist in relation to the claim area, (and at least in relation to land, the rights and interests possessed included a right to exclude others), the most that could be said in relation to tidal water, was that any native title rights would be non-exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3075">768 The Northern Territory also relied upon the following passage from Gumana (No 2 ) (at [28]-[31]):
 
 "His Honour's reasoning on this topic firstly recognised that the prerogative rights of the Crown with respect to the foreshore (the area between the mean high and low water marks) were subject to the separate common law rights of the public to fish and to navigate in the water above that land (at [61]-[65]), and to the arms of the sea (at [66]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3076">The next step was to reach the provisional view that the public rights to fish and to navigate in the foreshore and in the rivers and estuaries of Blue Mud Bay were abrogated by the land grants under the Land Rights Act [67]-[73].</sentence>
<sentence id="s3077">However, as noted above, his Honour then felt bound by Yarmirr FC to conclude at [80]-[87] that the grants under the Land Rights Act did not abrogate the public rights to fish or to navigate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3078">In all that discussion, his Honour recognised that the public right to fish and the public right to navigate in the foreshore and the arms of the sea were separate public rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3079">That is also apparent in his Honour's consideration of whether the licences under the Fisheries Act 1988 (NT) are different in nature from the public right to fish (at [90]-[92]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3080">That being so, there is no reason to think that his Honour intended to limit the public right to fish by reference to the navigable waters of the foreshore or of the arms of the sea simply because, by definition, the public right to navigate is confined to the navigable waters of the foreshore or of the arms of the sea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3081">
 
 I do not find in the reasons for judgment cause to conclude that the common law public right to fish in tidal waters was confined to tidal navigable waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3082">His Honour at [63] relied upon four authorities for the proposition that the prerogative rights of the Crown were subject to the common law public right to fish (and the common law public right to navigate).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3083">The first of those cases was Harper v Minister of Sea Fisheries [1989] HCA 47 ; (1989) 168 CLR 314 where Brennan J at 329-331 described the public right to fish as extending to tidal waters generally, although at one point his Honour used the expression 'tidal navigable waters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3084">His Honour's views were agreed with generally by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ at 325, and by Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ generally at 336.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3085">In New South Wales v Commonwealth [1975] HCA 58 ; (1975) 135 CLR 337, Stephen J at 423 referred to Hale's De Jure Maris as stating that the shore between 'the flux and reflux of the tide' was subject to the public right of fishing, and Jacobs J at 489 also referred to the 'public rights of fishing in tidal waters'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3086">Anderson v Alnwick District Council [1993] 1 WLR 1156 at 1166-1170 also referred to the public right to fish as extending to 'areas of tidal waters' without confining that right to navigable tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3087">So too did Burchett J in Minister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey (1993) 47 FCR 151 at 168.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3088">
 
 It is correct, as counsel for the applicants pointed out, that the public right to fish is said to have resembled in origin the right to navigate the sea and navigable rivers (see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3089">Attorney-General for British Columbia v Attorney-General for Canada [1914] AC 153 at 169).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3090">It is also correct to point out that his Honour in the reasons for judgment did not seek to distinguish between the extent of tidal waters affected by the public right to fish and those affected by the public right to navigate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3091">Counsel put that, if there is a coincidence in their extent, because by definition the public right to navigate can only be in tidal navigable waters, the public right to fish was intended also equally to be so confined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3092">
 
 However, for the reasons given, in my view the reasons for judgment indicate that the public right to fish as identified by his Honour was exercisable in the inter-tidal zone, including tidal waters, whether those waters are navigable or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3093">The public right to navigate is necessarily confined to tidal waters which are navigable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3094">" 
 

769 AFANT joined with the Northern Territory in submitting that this case had been conducted throughout upon the footing that it was critically important to ascertain to what extent the waters of Timber Creek are tidal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3095">During the course of evidence given on site, the Court had been taken to the bank of the Creek near an area known as Policeman's Point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3096">That area was at the northern end of the Creek, very near its junction with the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3097">It had been obvious that at least part of the Creek was subject to the ebb and flow of tides, and that the tidal area extended a distance of at least 200 to 300 metres from that junction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3098">AFANT submitted that it should be inferred that the Creek was a flowing waterway, at least during certain parts of the year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3099">770 AFANT further submitted that the discussion in the Revised Note regarding riparian rights was "essentially nonsensical".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3100">This was because such rights, by definition, would have to enure to those who had access to the Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3101">It was submitted that there was no principle that confined the "public right to fish" to tidal waters that were also navigable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3102">The only requirement was that the waters be "tidal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3103">771 Alternatively, AFANT submitted that the evidence in this case made it clear that amateur fishermen often used their boats to travel along the lower (northern) parts of the Creek, in the course of fishing, and looking for bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3104">It followed that the relevant parts of the Creek were not merely tidal, but also navigable, if that additional element were necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3105">FINDINGS REGARDING WATERS OF TIMBER CREEK 
 
772 The claimants' case regarding the waters of Timber Creek was presented in a manner that was not altogether helpful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3106">As the Northern Territory submitted, the position taken by Mr Parsons, in his closing address, cannot readily be reconciled with the later submissions filed on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3107">Those later submissions contained a good deal of irrelevant material, and introduced arguments that were not based upon any evidence led before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3108">773 I confess that I am still far from certain as to what Mr Parsons intended to convey when he said, repeatedly, in his closing submissions that the claimants did not maintain any claim in relation to what he called the "H 2 O".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3109">I am confident, however, that Mr Parsons intended to posit that a distinction should be drawn between tidal and non-tidal waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3110">He at all times acknowledged that there is a public right to fish in tidal waters, and that native title cannot impinge upon that right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3111">He submitted that native title can exist over non-tidal waters, and seemed to be saying that native title over such waters can be "exclusive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3112">774 The question whether the claimants have in fact resiled from that position, and now seek exclusive native title over the waters of the Creek might be significant if I had concluded that their native title rights and interests exist to the exclusion of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3113">However, as previously indicated, the evidence does not support a finding of exclusivity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3114">That makes much of the debate surrounding this issue somewhat sterile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3115">775 That said, the evidence supports a finding that the claimants have native title, under their traditional laws and customs, which allow them the right to fish, and to gather and take resources from the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3116">Insofar as those waters are tidal, these rights go no further than would be encompassed by the public right to fish in such waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3117">Insofar as those waters are non-tidal, the rights are non-exclusive, just as they are in relation to the land component of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3118">The claimants have no right to prevent others from exercising similar rights in those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3119">Members of AFANT, and others, can continue to fish in the non-tidal waters of the Creek because the native title rights and interests that exist in relation to those waters are non-exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3120">776 In effect, therefore, the claimants' right to fish in the tidal waters of the Creek is coextensive with the public right to fish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3121">It may be slightly different in relation to the non-tidal waters of the Creek, though the right does not enable the claimants to control access to those waters in any general sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3122">It might, however, permit the claimants to control access during specific times, as for example when undertaking any ceremonial or ritual activities in relation to those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3123">However, that right exists only to the extent necessary to enable such activities to be carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3124">777 I should perhaps add, for the sake of completeness, that contrary to the claimants' later submissions, I accept that the public right to fish in tidal waters exists as part of the common law of this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3125">That right appears to have been guaranteed at least since Magna Carta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3126">See generally: New South Wales v Commonwealth [1975] HCA 58 ; (1975) 135 CLR 337 (" Seas and Submerged Lands Case ") (at 419-20, per Stephen J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3127">I also accept that being a public, and not a proprietary right, it is amenable to abrogation or regulation by a competent legislature: Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries [1989] HCA 47 ; (1989) 168 CLR 314 (at 330, per Brennan J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3128">778 If it were necessary to consider the effect upon native title over the waters of the Creek of pastoral leases granted in the claim area, I would conclude that such acts of extinguishment would not necessarily be inconsistent with the exercise by indigenous people of their ordinary activities in relation to those waters: Arnhemland Aboriginal Land Trust v Director of Fisheries (NT) (2000) 170 ALR 1 (at [31], [52]-[53], per Mansfield J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3129">The same would be true of any supposed inconsistency between a public right to fish, and a non-exclusive native title right to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3130">779 If my conclusion that any native title rights over the waters of the Creek are "non-exclusive" is wrong, and that the true position is that these rights are properly to be regarded as operating to the exclusion of all others, the end result, so far as the claimants are concerned, will nonetheless be no different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3131">In that event, the pastoral leases that were granted over the claim area will have extinguished those rights, at least insofar as they are exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3132">The reason is simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3133">Section 47B will not be available because the condition that the waters of the Creek be shown to have been "occupied" at the time that the claimant application was made will not have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3134">There is a difficulty with the notion that the waters of a creek can be "occupied".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3135">However, even if one takes a broader view of that term, as required by the Full Court in Alyawarr , and accepts the possibility that in some cases there may be sufficient "use" of the waters, in the ways described in Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409, to constitute "occupation", the evidence in the present proceedings does not go far enough to meet those requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3136">Occasional fishing, whether from the banks of the Creek, or from a boat on the Creek, and infrequent head wetting ceremonies, do not, in my view, connote "occupation" in any relevantly acceptable sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3137">780 Accordingly, whatever analysis is adopted in relation to the waters of the Creek, members of the public have a right to fish in those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3138">Insofar as the waters are tidal, that right was initially conceded by the claimants, but the concession was later retracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3139">Having regard to the authorities, the concession was properly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3140">In relation to the non-tidal waters of the Creek, the right to fish exists on a different basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3141">No claimant, despite their native title rights in relation to those waters, can exercise those rights to the exclusion of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3142">781 I find, therefore, that AFANT's members are in no way precluded by any native title determination that this Court may make from continuing to enjoy unrestricted access to recreational fishing in the waters of Timber Creek, whether by boat or from the banks of the Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3143">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
 
782 The claimants have established that, at the time these applications were brought, the land in the claim area was "occupied", in the sense contemplated by s 47B of the NT Act , by one or more of their number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3144">They have also established that the land was not covered by an existing freehold estate or a lease, or by a proclamation under which it was to be used for public purposes, or for a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3145">They have therefore satisfied the requirements of s 47B , save in relation to the waters of the Creek, and Lots 16, 22, 33, 35 and 37, each of which was acknowledged to be outside the ambit of that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3146">783 Lot 16 is "Special Purposes Lease 00494" owned by the Conservation Land Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3147">Lot 22 is "Crown Lease Term 01923" owned by MR Millwood Pty Ltd. Lot 33 is "Occupation Licence 03317" owned by the Timber Creek Community Government Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3148">Lots 35 and 37 are each described in the Tenure History Folder as "Administrative Parcel[s]" and are owned by the Northern Territory Department of Lands, Housing and Local Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3149">It is for these reasons that these five Lots do not fall within the scope of s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3150">784 It follows that any acts of extinguishment that would otherwise have been brought about by past pastoral leases must be disregarded save in relation to the five Lots just discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3151">The position in relation to those five Lots is complicated, but it seems that native title in relation to them has been extinguished by past pastoral leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3152">However, it may be that the extinguishment will be only partial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3153">It will be necessary, unless the parties can reach agreement, to hear further argument regarding these Lots before any final native title determination is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3154">785 I find that (subject to the five Lots referred to above) there should be a determination of native title in favour of the Ngaliwurru and Nungali Peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3155">All of the elements necessary to ground such a determination have been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3156">The three applications before the Court name the persons on whose behalf each application is made, or otherwise describe them sufficiently clearly so that whether or not a particular person is a member of the native title claim group can readily be ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3157">Each application therefore meets the requirements of s 61(4) of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3158">I also find that each application is made with the authority of the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3159">786 I find that none of the applications is made in respect of any area where a determination of native title has already been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3160">None of the applications is therefore precluded by s 61A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3161">787 As foreshadowed, I find that none of the applications is made in respect of an area where a "previous exclusive possession act" has been done, such that a claimant application must not be made that covers any of the area: see s 61A(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3162">I find that s 47B operates to overcome any restriction, based upon any such "previous exclusive possession act", upon the making of any such application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3163">788 I find that, to the extent that the claims related to areas subject to any "previous non-exclusive possession act", and each application nonetheless asserts rights of "possession, occupation, use and enjoyment ... to the exclusion of all others", those applications are not barred by s 61A(3) because any such "previous non-exclusive possession act" must similarly be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3164">789 These findings do not enable me, at this stage, to proffer a draft determination of native title in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3165">790 An application for a determination of native title must adequately define the native title group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3166">Section 225 provides that any determination of native title must set out the persons or group of persons who are to hold the common or group rights comprising the native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3167">Both these requirements raise the difficulty of identifying the members of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3168">791 Section 56 of the NT Act overcomes this difficulty in the case of native title determinations by permitting the native title holders to nominate a prescribed body corporate to hold the land in trust for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3169">It is not always necessary to have native title held on trust by a body corporate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3170">Section 56(2)(c) provides that the common law holders can elect to hold their native title personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3171">It will be a matter for the claimants, in this case, to determine whether they wish to proceed to nominate a prescribed body corporate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3172">792 In addition, having found that the claimants have established the existence of non-exclusive native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area, it will be necessary to hear the parties regarding the orders that should be made, and the precise form that any native title determination should take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3173">793 To assist the parties, I can indicate that I propose to make a determination that is broadly to the effect that native title exists in the areas of land and waters claimed to be depicted upon an agreed map, and described in an agreed schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3174">In that determination, the terms "land" and "waters" should bear the meanings given by s 253 of the NT Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3175">794 The persons who hold the communal, group and individual rights will be the indigenous persons identified as members of the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3176">795 In relation to the land in the claim area, the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests of the native title holders that are possessed under the traditional laws and customs are, subject to the traditional laws and customs that govern the exercise of the native title rights and interests by the native title holders, non-exclusive rights to use and enjoy the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3177">As presently advised, I would prefer to avoid the use of terms such as "possess" and "occupy", particularly having regard to the observations of the High Court in Ward HC about the difficulties associated with the use of terms such as "possession" in the context of non-exclusive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3178">That would not preclude a determination in the form approved by the Full Court in A-G (NT) v Ward to which reference was previously made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3179">796 If that form were followed, the incidents of native title should then be spelt out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3180">These would be expected to include the right to hunt on the land, to gather and use its natural resources, including food and medicinal plants, and to have access to and use natural water on the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3181">They would also be expected to include the right to live on the land, to camp, to erect shelters and to move about the land, and the right to engage in cultural activities on the land, to conduct ceremonies, to hold meetings and to participate in cultural practices relating to birth and death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3182">They would include the right to have access to, maintain and protect sites of significance on the land, and the right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the land by other indigenous people who recognise themselves to be governed by aboriginal traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3183">797 I emphasise that these native title rights and interests do not confer exclusive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3184">They do not confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the land or waters on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3185">798 In relation to the waters in the claim area, the native title rights and interests that are possessed under the traditional laws and customs are, subject to the traditional laws and customs that govern the exercise of the native title rights and interests by the native title holders, rights to use and enjoy those waters, though not to the exclusion of all others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3186">The rights that can be spelt out more particularly will include the right to fish, and the right to gather and use resources within the area covered by those waters, as well as the right to engage in cultural activities and conduct ceremonies in or on those waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3187">799 I should emphasise that these are merely preliminary thoughts as to the form that any final native title determination should take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3188">A determination in that form would accord generally with the consent determination made in A-G NT v Ward , which also involved non-exclusive native title rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3189">It would also accord generally with the native title determination made by Mansfield J in Alyawarr at first instance, and subsequently varied by the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3190">It must be remembered, however, that in Alyawarr , the evidence supported a finding of exclusive native title in relation to that part of the determination area identified as the Town of Hatches Creek, whereas in the present proceedings, the evidence is to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3191">It is would also be useful to consider the native title determination ultimately made by the Full Court in De Rose (No 2) , which involved non-exclusive native title, and avoided the use of terms such as "possess" and "occupy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3192">800 I propose to direct that each party to these proceedings file and serve an outline of contentions regarding the orders that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3193">It would be helpful if a draft native title determination, consistent with these reasons for judgment, were to be appended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3194">If the parties are able to reach agreement on some aspects of the proposed determination that would obviously be of great assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3195">801 Finally, I should express my appreciation to the parties and their legal representatives for the helpful and cooperative spirit in which these proceedings were conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3196">The case was handled in a highly professional manner, with all sides co-operating to ameliorate the challenges of taking evidence on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3197">I certify that the preceding eight hundred and one (801) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.</sentence>

 SCHEDULE C 
 SITE VISITS 1, 2 and 8 MARCH 2005 
 
 DAY 1, TUESDAY 1 MARCH 2005 
 
 The hearing commenced at the Timber Creek Community Government Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3199">After opening addresses, the Court adjourned for several site visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3200">The procedure followed was that witnesses would give evidence at each site concerning its significance, and the relationship between the applicants and the area in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3201">The witnesses were then cross-examined by counsel for the Northern Territory and AFANT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3202">The witnesses called on the first day were Alan Griffiths, Jerry Jones and Josie Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3203">Site 1: Wirip Ngalur Katpan (site behind Wayside camping ground "Dingo Dreaming"); 
 
 The first site visited, Wirip Ngalur Katpan, was a "Dingo Dreaming" location at Timber Creek, behind the Wayside Inn, which was the local camping ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3204">Alan Griffiths approached the creek and called out in the Nungali language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3205">He then conducted a "head wetting" ceremony at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3206">He explained that the ceremony took place at this spot because it was the place of the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3207">He then said that a "whitefella" had attempted to build a bridge here without permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3208">Jerry Jones said that if newcomers did not go through a head wetting ceremony, the Dingo Dreaming would cause death and illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3209">He said that this was what had happened to the man who built the bridge, Maxie Duncan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3210">He explained that Mr Duncan had died suddenly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3211">Under cross-examination Mr Griffiths explained that the Dingo Dreaming was his mother's father's Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3212">He said that the dingo had travelled Miriuwung country, near Kununurra, to that place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3213">As the dingo moved through different countries, it spoke the language of whatever country it happened to be in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3214">Site 2: Karani --- Missing rock behind the house 
 
 The Court and the parties drove west along the Victoria Highway for approximately 3.5 kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3215">Mr Griffiths indicated a place half way up the hillside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3216">The Court Officer photographed the scene, and informed the Court that Mr Griffiths had said that this was the place where "a rock was missing, behind the house".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3217">Later, at site 5, Mr Griffiths told the Court that the rock had been part of the Spider Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3218">It was now missing, but had formerly been located on the south side of the creek, next to the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3219">Site 3: Karani --- Spider Dreaming made hole in ground near tree 
 
 The convoy proceeded further west along the highway, and again stopped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3220">Mr Griffiths then pointed to another place and told the Court that the site was a hole in the ground, near a tree, made by the Spider Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3221">Site 4: Wayatpayi --- Wirip's helmet 
 
 Once again, the convoy proceeded further west along the highway, and again Mr Griffiths stopped to point out a place he described as "Helmet Hill".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3222">Later, Mr Griffiths told the Court that this was the hat, or helmet, of the "Wirip", or dingo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3223">He said that he still used the hat for corroborees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3224">He said that the ceremonies were not recorded in any written form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3225">He tapped his head, and said that ceremonies were kept there, and passed on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3226">Site 5: Ridge / cleared area 
 
 The Court was then taken to a cleared ridge area twenty metres from the Victoria Highway turn off, towards the Telstra tower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3227">Mr Griffiths could not tell the Court the name of this site as it was his cousin's sister's place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3228">He explained the Dreaming of the barramundi hunting the Wirip and the rock wallaby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3229">He had learned this Dreaming from his "grandfather", Old Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3230">He said that gravel had been scraped or cleared from this area on the site of the Wirip Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3231">Mr Griffiths had been informed of this by Mr Jones who had telephoned him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3232">Mr Griffiths told Mr Jones to tell the person removing the gravel to stop because he was disturbing the Wirip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3233">Mr Griffiths was asked who he consulted when decisions of that kind had to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3234">He said Jerry Jones, Jo Lewis, Sammy Darby and "all the mob".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3235">Mr Griffiths then described the process of "Winan" and how bamboo spears and boomerangs were carried by foot across the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3236">He characterised winan as "fifty-fifty", and showed the Court a yellow rock from which was derived paint for corroborees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3237">He also produced a flint that could be used for a spear and demonstrated how he lit fires, a practice that he had learned from Lamparangana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3238">He said that he had taught his grandsons that same practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3239">Mr Jones then gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3240">He said that he "grew up here", and that he still did the same winan that had been done for generations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3241">He said that he taught his grandsons that winan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3242">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the Dingo Dreaming at this location involved the same dingo as had come from Miriuwung, and had been discussed at the head wetting ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3243">He said that a different dingo from Bullock had traversed a different part of the land, to which he pointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3244">In re-examination, Mr Griffiths was asked who else he consulted when making decisions such as the one relating to the removal of gravel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3245">He answered, "my mob" which he described as including his sons and grandsons, Jerry, Sammy, Jo and William.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3246">Site 6: Kulungara 
 
 The Court was next taken to a vantage point overlooking the town a little further up the road on the way to the Telstra tower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3247">Mr Griffiths said that Winan came through here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3248">Mr Jones pointed out places of interest in both English and Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3249">For example, he said that Makalamayi was located at the juncture of Timber Creek and Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3250">Josie Jones, Mr Jones' wife, gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3251">She said that she knew all of the places that her husband had mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3252">She had learnt them when she was ten years old from "the first mob", being her parents and her mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3253">She said that she had passed on that knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3254">She pointed to a tree, which she said was used to make didgeridoos.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3255">She pointed to another tree, which she described as "billygoat plum" in Nungali, and to a third tree, which she said was ironwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3256">It was used for making fighting sticks, and digging yams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3257">The roots were used for waxing the sticks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3258">Under cross-examination, Mrs Jones said that she was taught these stories for this country from the first mob.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3259">The languages used had been Nungali and Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3260">She was taught by Violet Paliti, her mother's mother, and by her father's mother and her grandmother's sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3261">Doris Roberts gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3262">She said that at site 5, she had found a white stone used for making paint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3263">That paint, she said, was used for dancing and painting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3264">She still used the paint from stones such as these in the ways she described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3265">Finally, Mr Griffiths pointed to a tree, which he said was used to make marks on the skin of the chest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3266">Young people still did this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3267">George Jones came forward to show the markings on his chest that he said had been made in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3268">Site 7: Telstra tower lookout on point 
 
 On approaching this site, Mr Griffiths called out, in Nungali, the word "Yakpali".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3269">He pointed out Kuminyiyung, a hill to which the Wirip had gone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3270">He described the Dreaming of two snakes --- a cheeky snake, and a quiet snake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3271">They had fought over poison in their teeth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3272">He said that his grandfather had told him that the hill, Kuminyiyung, had poison in it from the snakes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3273">In this area, miners had mined for diamonds without permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3274">Mr Griffiths said that he had stopped them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3275">He was asked whether he told his children about the Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3276">He replied, "yes, they already know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3277">" He described another Dreaming, that of the humpyback monster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3278">Mr Jones pointed to various sites from the lookout including the Myatt community where he and his family lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3279">He said the Lewis family lived there, as did Roy Harrington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3280">He pointed to another community, Kulardi .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3281">He said that he knew the same stories as Mr Griffiths, learnt them from his elders and taught them to his sons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3282">Under cross-examination, Mr Jones said that the humpyback monster spoke only Nungali, and no other languages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3283">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths explained in more detail about the cheeky and quiet snakes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3284">He agreed that the snakes spoke Nungali but said that if they travelled to other countries, they could speak the language of the Dreamings of those countries too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3285">Mrs Jones gave evidence that she knew the same stories and the places that her husband had referred to at this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3286">She had learnt them from the old people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3287">She pointed to places in the area where she used to hunt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3288">She said that she obtained "tucker" from a palm she identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3289">A little further back towards the convoy of cars, away from the edge of the ridge, Mr Griffiths described how he and his friends used to catch birds and kill them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3290">They made a circle of stones, which was still visible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3291">A man would lie under branches in the middle of the circle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3292">He would have a stick and poke it up through the branches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3293">On top of the stick would be a feather to attract attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3294">They would then make smoke from the stones, attracting the birds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3295">When the birds arrived, the man underneath would reach up and grab them, breaking their necks for food.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3296">He said that this practice is not followed to anything like the same extent now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3297">Somewhat sardonically he noted that the younger generation hunted with rifles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3298">DAY 2, WEDNESDAY 2 MARCH 2005 
 
 Site 1: Bridge across Victoria River 
 
 On approaching this site, Mr Griffiths called out "Yakpali" in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3299">He said that this meant "country" in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3300">He said that this site was the place of the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3301">The dingo came to the river; the barramundi called out to him to "turn back, it's my home".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3302">The barramundi spoke Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3303">The dingo then went to the place that had been identified to the Court on the previous day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3304">Mr Griffiths said when the army had proposed building the bridge across the Victoria River, about three years earlier, it created a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3305">However, he had allowed them to build it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3306">Originally the army wanted to knock out the bank of the river at this site, but this was the place of the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3307">Mr Griffith's said that "in the early days", people did not ask permission to build on land that was the site of a Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3308">He said that the army ought to ask permission to build structures like the bridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3309">In any case, he had allowed it to be built, and the army had paid him compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3310">He said that he distributed the money to "all the Timber Creek mob and my mob", who he named as Jerry Jones, Georgie Jones, Christopher Jones, Stephen Jones, Kenny Griffiths and Kim Griffiths, and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3311">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said the name of the barramundi was "Marna".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3312">It came from Jaminjung, and travelled to Ngaliwurru country, finishing at Yanturi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3313">He said that this was his Dreaming, given to him by his grandfather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3314">In re-examination, Mr Griffiths said that Old Lamparangana had brought him to this site and told him about the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3315">He said that he could not reveal the stories because there were women present, but that he would disclose them at a later hearing that would be attended by men only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3316">Mrs Jones then told the Court that the Griffiths and Jones families, Doris Roberts' family, Larry's family, "all them mob" had been involved in the decision about the bridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3317">She said that she knew the story of the dingo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3318">She supported Mr Griffiths' account of how the dingo had come to this place, and then to the site of the head wetting ceremony held on the previous day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3319">Mrs Jones then showed the Court some eucalyptus leaves, which she said were bush medicine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3320">She demonstrated their use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3321">She showed the Court other leaves, which she called "Manyanyi" in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3322">These leaves were used for rubbing on skin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3323">She said that she had shown her children how to use them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3324">Under cross-examination, Mrs Jones said that the Wirip Dreaming was not hers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3325">However, she said that the Barramundi Dreaming was her Dreaming, and that it had been given to her by her father's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3326">Finally, Mrs Roberts showed the Court some wild rockmelon, which she called "Wanput" in Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3327">She said that she could tell the difference between those that were ready for eating, and those that were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3328">She said that when ripe, the fruit was eaten whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3329">Site 2: Jalalawuti (flat rocks on banks of Victoria River) 
 
 Mr Griffiths said that this site was called "Jalalawuti".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3330">He told the Court that the Dreaming for the site was the meeting of the shark, the stingray and the catfish from the east, and the barramundi from Makalamayi in the west.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3331">As the barramundi approached, the shark said to him, "this is my home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3332">You go back where you came from.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3333">" However, the barramundi did not want to "go that way" so they started fighting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3334">The flat rocks in this area were part of the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3335">In "early times", people had tried to take some of the rocks from the site to build a pub.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3336">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the shark had come from Makalamayi and that it remained constantly at this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3337">He said that the Shark Dreaming was in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3338">He said that he had acquired the Shark Dreaming from his mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3339">Mr Griffiths was then asked about "ngurlu" (totemic relationship or skin).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3340">He described his ngurlu as "ninipi", a little bird.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3341">He said that he acquired it from his mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3342">He said that "kuning" had the same meaning as "ngurlu".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3343">Mr Griffiths then said that the stingray was from Yanturi and spoke Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3344">He said that the catfish had travelled along the same path as the stingray, and also spoke Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3345">However, the shark, the stingray and the catfish could all speak both Nungali and Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3346">In re-examination, Mr Griffiths said that this site was a registered sacred site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3347">He said that it had become registered following the major land claim in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3348">Sammy Darby gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3349">He said that he could see a crocodile on the far bank of the river eating some food, possibly a kangaroo, or maybe a fish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3350">He knew the stories that Mr Griffiths had just relayed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3351">He had learnt those stories, and about the sites in question from Old Darby when he was about ten years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3352">Jo Lewis then gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3353">He too had heard all of the stories that Mr Griffiths had told.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3354">He had learnt them from his grandfather, Old Mutpuyula (Jo) and Old Jack Depot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3355">He said that he had walked around Makalamayi, Kulmariniyung, Paralji, Jalalawuti, Turtpurinyi, Tilwarini, and Purumpirinyung with his grandfather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3356">He said that there were many indigenous people in those parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3357">Under cross-examination, Mr Lewis said that both his father's father and his mother's father used to take him walking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3358">He said that he spoke both Nungali and Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3359">His mother's father was from Jaminjung country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3360">In the Timber Creek area, there were people from Nungali, Ngaliwurru and Jaminjung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3361">William Gulwin gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3362">He said that he had been taught by his uncle, Mr Alan Griffiths, about the Dreamings when he was aged about nine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3363">Mrs Jones gave evidence to say that she too knew the stories from this place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3364">She had learnt from the old people in Timber Creek about the barramundi, the shark, the Stingray and the Catfish Dreamings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3365">The old people had shown her how to hunt and would tell her the stories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3366">She had passed them on to her children and grandchildren.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3367">Chris Griffiths gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3368">He said that he was still learning the stories from his father, Alan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3369">He did not fish in this spot regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3370">He could see the crocodile on the other side of the river in the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3371">When asked how he could distinguish a crocodile from a log at that distance, he explained that he had learned how to do so from his father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3372">Site 3: Makalamayi 
 
 On approaching this site, Mr Griffiths called out something that was indecipherable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3373">He said the name of the place was Makalamayi, and that the juncture of the Victoria River and Timber Creek was called Jalmin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3374">He pointed to the middle of the river and said there had once been a long hollow log there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3375">He had learnt about it from his grandfather and passed it on to his mob.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3376">He said that when his grandfather passed away the log had disappeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3377">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that he had learnt about Makalamayi from his mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3378">Mrs Jones then confirmed that the name of the place was Makalamayi and that the name of the log was "Jalmin".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3379">She said that she had learned about it from the old people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3380">She said that from that point she could see the big hill called "Karnaryulumin", "Turutpurinyi", "Tilwarini", a little creek that ran to the waterhole, and "Kuninkiyung", which was a fishing spot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3381">She said that old people used to fish there, on the other side of the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3382">She said that the other side of the river was "Lawi country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3383">Makalamayi extended down to the crossing that used to be used for foot crossings to Bradshaw station before the bridge was built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3384">Under cross-examination, Mrs Jones said there was a Shark Dreaming at Karnaryulumin and also at Turutpurinyi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3385">She had walked around there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3386">There was also a Shark Dreaming in Kuninkiyung.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3387">She said that the name Lawi came from a Dreaming about a small wallaby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3388">Both Ngaliwurru and Nungali were spoken in Lawi country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3389">When asked whether the fishing spot had a Shark Dreaming, Mrs Jones replied that it did and that her people still fished there today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3390">When asked how far up Timber Creek the tides went, she replied about two hundred metres from the juncture of Timber Creek and Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3391">She said that Aboriginal people fished for turtles in Timber Creek, and that white men also fished there, but in their case, for bait fish and "tanyan" (cherrapin).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3392">In re-examination, Mrs Jones said the tides went approximately as far as the police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3393">The Court then moved down to the bank of Timber Creek, almost at the juncture with Victoria River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3394">Mrs Roberts and Mrs Jones picked wild gooseberries and bush tomatoes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3395">Mrs Jones said she first started eating bush tucker at about the age of six.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3396">Mr Alan Griffiths then pointed to a paperbark tree, which he said was used for making traditional hats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3397">Site 4: Tilwarini (water hole with water lilies and head wetting ceremony) 
 
 Mr Griffiths conducted a second head wetting ceremony for all newcomers to this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3398">He said that it was called "Tilwarini", and was the site of the humpyback monster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3399">Head wetting was done here for the same reason as at the site of the first head wetting --- for the Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3400">The Dreaming had left something here, and head wetting had to be done "so country will know you", otherwise a person could suffer illness or death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3401">As a boy, Mr Griffiths had camped at this place, in order to get his head wet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3402">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the Dreaming at this site differed from the Dingo Dreaming at the site of the first head wetting ceremony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3403">He said that the humpyback had made a toilet here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3404">He had conducted a head wetting ceremony for some of his grandchildren on this day because this was the first time they had been to this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3405">Mr Griffiths said that it was unusual for members of his family to fish at this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3406">In the wet, there was sometimes more water at the water hole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3407">Sometimes, they might catch small perch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3408">In addition, cherrapin might be caught at this location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3409">Mr Jones then gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3410">He was asked how he knew his way to this place and replied that he had known about it from the time that he was a child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3411">His granddaughter had gone through a head wetting ceremony that day because she had never been to that site before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3412">She was only four years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3413">His other grandchildren had been through a head wetting at this location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3414">He said that he knew the Humpyback Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3415">He said it was a very important Dreaming, and that he had learnt it from his elders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3416">If Mr Griffiths had not been present, it would have been his role to call out to the monster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3417">Under cross-examination, Mr Jones told the Court of the path that the monster had travelled, finishing at Maiyalaniwung, Violet Paliti's country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3418">He said that if a person travelled to Maiyalaniwung for the first time, he or she would have to go through a head wetting ceremony there too because it was a different country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3419">The country had to "get to know you".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3420">Mr Jones said that he came to this area often to get honey from the cave, yam and water lily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3421">He did not like whitefellas coming here from the town to get their bait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3422">They got their cherrapin closer to the township.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3423">He said:
 
 "If we don't do it, why --- you know, why have you been doing it?...</sentence>
<sentence id="s3424">you can't just walk into any European's little block of land and do what you want to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3425">And why they go onto Aboriginal land and do what they want to do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s3426">" 
 

 Mrs Roberts then collected some lily root, which she described as "nati".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3427">She said that it could be eaten as is, boiled or roasted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3428">The fruit from the lily flower could be eaten as is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3429">Mrs Jones showed the Court a fruit like a grape which she said was called "kiringiltji" or "kumpunyu" in Nungali.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3430">She had a smaller white version called "margarin".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3431">She showed the Court a rock called "marta" in Nungali that she said made babies strong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3432">She would burn the rock on a fire, smash it up into a powder, mix it with some water to make a paste, and put it on the baby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3433">Site 5: Lirimin (Centipede Dreaming) 
 
 Mr Griffiths approached a rectangular stone protruding from the ground by approximately a foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3434">He explained that this was a sacred site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3435">An elder had told him that he was not allowed to touch the stone, otherwise he might get sick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3436">He was not even permitted to put his hand on the stone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3437">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that he could mark a dead person's name in charcoal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3438">He said no one was buried at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3439">It was simply a Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3440">The stone had been put there in the dreamtime, and he had been shown it by his grandfather 
 
 Mr Jones gave a similar account of the significance of the stone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3441">He explained that the barbed wire fence around the site had been erected by the Sacred Sites Authority five or six years earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3442">This was because the cattle had damaged the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3443">Originally, there had been a grazing licence over the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3444">Pat Jatjat, Mr Griffiths' older sister, then gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3445">She said that she had grown up on VRD and had heard the Centipede Dreaming from her grandfather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3446">William Gulwin said that he knew this place as "centipede" in English and "limirin" in Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3447">The Court then moved several metres to a flatter rock embedded in the ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3448">Mr Griffiths said it was the head of the centipede.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3449">He pointed to two eyes in the rock to indicate the head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3450">He said he was first shown this rock when aged about four.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3451">An elder had told him to look out for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3452">He said that when he died, his grandchildren would look after it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3453">He explained that his wife was from Miriuwung country so he had been forced to leave Mr Jones in charge of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3454">Site 6: Ritual ground 
 
 The Court arrived at a place marked out by a rock which Mr Griffiths described as the "main ring place" used for a "ceremony for kids".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3455">He said that people from pastoral leases such as Bradshaw, Daly River, Legune, Kildurk, Waterloo, VRD and Coolibah used this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3456">He noted that no women had gotten out of the cars to see this site because it was reserved for men.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3457">The boys who were initiated here were ten or eleven years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3458">He pointed to his grandson, Sidney, who was ten years old, as an example of how old a boy would be at initiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3459">He said a corroboree was conducted here when Old Pankaman got sick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3460">He had a photograph of a painting that he had painted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3461">He said the rock had been there before he was born.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3462">Under cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the people that he had named from the pastoral leases were from Jaminjung, Ngaringman, Karangpuru, Ngangomeri and Ngaliwurru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3463">He also said that the last time a children's ceremony had been conducted at this site was about thirty years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3464">He elaborated further on the corroboree done for Old Pankaman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3465">He said that this was not Pankaman's country but that he had become sick in this area so that was where the corroboree was done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3466">Then his spirit went away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3467">However, he did not die.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3468">He was still alive and living at Stokes Range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3469">In re-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the fact that no kids ceremony had been done here for thirty years did not mean it was not an important site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3470">He said that he and his family were still obliged to look after it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3471">Indeed, he said the site was still used as a place for punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3472">Mr Griffiths was also asked whether he had a song for the Centipede Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3473">He said that he did; and that his grandfather had given it to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3474">He sang it for the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3475">He said "kudjingka" was the word for song, and "yarinti" was the song for the centipede "when he bite you".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3476">He said he had kudjingka in his head, and that songs were not written down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3477">Finally, under further cross-examination, Mr Griffiths said that the Centipede Dreaming was his own, given to him by his mother's father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3478">His mother's father had also given him the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3479">If anyone "had" those songs, they could sing them, provided they asked his permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3480">Site 7: Old cemetery site 
 
 The last site to which the Court was taken was the old cemetery site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3481">Mr Jones began by indicating a stone, which he said was his mother's mother's grave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3482">Her name was Holly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3483">He said that some stones could not be seen because of the grass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3484">He said that about sixty to seventy people were buried at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3485">He pointed out old tracks in and out of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3486">Further along, Mr Jones pointed to the grave of Tiger Wajaka from Stokes Range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3487">He had been a police tracker, before Mr Jones' time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3488">Mr Jones then pointed out an old mattress frame used for carrying the bodies to this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3489">He said the bodies were wrapped in calico for burial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3490">He pointed to a cave and said that Old Lamparangana was buried there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3491">His said that Lamparangana's skull was still in that cave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3492">Mr Jones next pointed to some glass embedded in the ground and said that women used glass to cut their legs to obtain blood that was painted onto the foreheads of the corpses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3493">The Court then arrived at a burial site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3494">There were rocks in a ring shape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3495">A billycan had been left there and Mr Jones explained that this was to give water to the dead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3496">Only a son-in-law or a brother-in-law could dig a grave or bury a dead person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3497">The same rule existed today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3498">Mr Jones gave the names of other people who were buried at this site: Johnny, Dina (Mrs Jones' grandmother), Bullita Jack, Depot Jack, Polly (his grandmother), Sandy (Mrs Jones' mother's father), Jacky Jacky (Violet Paliti's father) and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3499">Mr Jones explained the term "poison cousin".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3500">He said there were certain people in one's family who you could not talk to or sit next to; for example, one's mother-in-law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3501">He said that burials were still conducted at Myatt because burial had to take place at a registered site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3502">He also said that burials had to be done at the "right" place --- a person had to be buried to "go back" to his or her own country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3503">Mrs Jones confirmed that Old Lamparangana was buried at this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3504">She referred to him as her "mapiju", her "father uncle".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3505">She named other people buried here: Walamawuk and Pankaman, who were two sisters, Sandy (her mother's father), Lapir, Old Tiger Wajaka, Old Charlie and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3506">When asked whether these people were relatives, Mrs Jones answered, "Yes, relation, all Nungali people.</sentence>

 Site 1: Muruning (One Mile) 
 
 At the conclusion of Mrs Paliti's evidence, the Court visited One Mile community, a short drive from the centre of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3509">Evidence was given regarding this community, whose aboriginal name was "Muruning".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3510">That name was taken from the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3511">Sammy Darby was among those who lived there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3512">He described some of the bush tucker around his home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3513">He identified a green plum called "jamuru".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3514">He said that by the trees on the creek, he could get bush apple when it turned orange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3515">Women collected bush yam along the creek beds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3516">Yams were from there from the beginning; they were left there in the dreamtime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3517">He said there were also sugarbag trees by the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3518">Site 2: Murlun (Half Mile) 
 
 The Court then visited a smaller community, closer back towards the centre of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3519">The name of the place was "Murlun".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3520">Once again, the Court was shown bush tucker that was collected and eaten, and told about the fish that were available from the waters of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3521">There was evidence that the creek ran all year round, even in the dry season.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3522">Site 3: Kunuma (Blowfly Dreaming site at Boab Tree) 
 
 The Court was taken to a place at the rear of the caravan park in the centre of town, near the creek itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3523">Mr Griffiths explained how the little Blowfly Dreaming was near the big boab tree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3524">That Dreaming continued even thought the tree was gone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3525">He called the tree "kunama".</sentence>
<sentence id="s3526">Pointing out bush tucker, he identified a fig tree ("jalwa") and flying fox ("warpa"), which he said he still ate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3527">Whitefellas thought they were poison, but, in reality, they were really very tasty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3528">Explaining more about the Blowfly Dreaming, Mr Griffiths said that the fly had stopped the dingo at this site and told him it was his home, and that the dingo should turn back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3529">He sang the "kudjingka", or song, of the dingo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3530">Thereafter, the dingo had run back to the site that the Court next visited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3531">Site 4: Wirip Ngalur Katpan (site where Dingo Dreaming ended at pool) 
 
 Mr Griffiths took the Court past the place where newcomers had undergone a head wetting on the first day of the trial at the site of the Dingo Dreaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3532">He said that this was the place to which the dingo had returned when the blowfly turned him back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3533">It was still a part of Timber Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3534">The water used to be clear before the bank was built up at the site of the head wetting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3535">There had been a rock visible at this site, but when the bank was built, it backed up the water so that it covered the rock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3536">Mr Griffiths pointed out more bush tucker at this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3537">He said there were bush yam, fig trees and leichhardt trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3538">The leichhardt tree had yellow fruit in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3539">There was also a creeper that was good for eating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3540">He said that the yam had been left by the humpyback.</sentence>
