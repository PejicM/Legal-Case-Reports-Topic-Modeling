1 This matter involves both an appeal against a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") and an application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to add a further ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal's decision rejected the appellant's application for a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The ground of appeal is that the Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the Tribunal's decision was affected by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The alleged error, it is said, is manifested in three ways which can be described compendiously in the following manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In light both of the findings the Tribunal made and of what it was prepared to accept of the appellant's account of events, its conclusions that the appellant did not have "a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ... political opinion" indicated that it incorrectly interpreted and applied the constituent elements of that formula in the Refugees Convention as incorporated by s 36 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant, nonetheless, accepts that the Tribunal's initial formulation of the law relating to who is a "refugee" --- it was contained in the now almost boilerplate version given in Tribunal decisions --- is unobjectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 My own view is that to the extent that the Tribunal is alleged to have misinterpreted or misapplied the terms "well-founded fear" and "persecution", the appeal does no more than invite me to enter upon questions of fact and degree which, as is well accepted, are for the Tribunal to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The alleged error in interpreting or applying the terms "for reasons ... of political opinion" involves a misreading of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In any event the Tribunal had a separate reason for disposing of the application and this was that State protection was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal arises in an unusual way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">After both the decisions of the Tribunal (of 3 December 2003) and of the Federal Magistrate (of 13 April 2005), the appellant became aware of an article jointly authored by the Tribunal member who heard and rejected his application, in which it was argued that torture may be licit in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">That article, jointly authored by Mirko Bagaric (the Tribunal member) and Julie Clarke, is entitled "Not Enough Official Torture in the World?</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Circumstances in which Torture is Morally Justifiable" and was published in the University of San Francisco Law Review in Spring 2005 (see (2005) 39 USFL Rev 581).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The new ground of appeal for which leave is sought alleges in consequence of what is said in the Article, that (a) it should be inferred that the Tribunal member did not properly interpret the protection given against persecution under the Migration Act ; and (b) there is a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal was or may have been biased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 I have refused leave to amend because I am satisfied that in the particular circumstances of this matter having regard (i) to the nature of the claims made by the appellant in his application to the Tribunal and (ii) to the particular burden of the article in question, the proposed ground does not have a reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">BACKGROUND AND THE APPELLANT'S CLAIMS TO REFUGEE STATUS 
 
6 The appellant is a Sinhalese national of Sri Lanka who arrived in Australia on 16 August 2002 and applied (together with his family) for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">A delegate of the respondent Minister having refused to grant a protection visa, he sought review of that decision by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The following account of his claims before the Tribunal is in pr&eacute;cis form and is taken from the brief statement of those claims in the appellant's written submissions to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 The appellant is a strong supporter of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ("SLFP").</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He therefore experienced discrimination, as did his family, from the rival United National Party ("UNP").</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 The appellant became a member of the Sri Lanka Police Force and was eventually transferred to the anti-terrorist unit attached to the Criminal Investigation Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In 1994 he became an officer in the Search Unit of the President's Security Division ("the PSD") and in 1995 was an officer in charge of the Search Unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This involved him in daily contact with and responsibility for the security of the President of Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On one occasion he discovered a suicide bomb jacket in the Parliament and hand grenades close to the President's house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 The appellant also campaigned on behalf of the People's Alliance ("the PA") in the 1989 and 1994 elections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">11 During the 1994 election campaign he received threatening calls from his political enemies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Stones were thrown at his house and windows broken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">His father was attacked and assaulted and received serious injuries to his head and hands which put him in hospital for more than a week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">12 During the 2001 election the UNP came to power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Persons involved with the UNP made threatening calls and wanted to take revenge on the appellant for an attack on UNP supporters for which they believed he was responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">13 In May 2002 the appellant was severely assaulted by 3 masked people who beat him with clubs close to his home and made political threats to him at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He reported the matter but the police not having any evidence as to identity could not do anything about the assault.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Threats against the appellant continued for political reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">14 The appellant came under pressure from one of his superiors to make changes in the police records in order to clear the name of that superior.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant was reluctant to do that but was in fear of consequences the senior officer could cause him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That senior officer was arrested but is at present released on bail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 The appellant decided to leave the country "in order to escape from the hands of my enemies and to save my life and my family".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">His chief sources of fear were political opponents who were behind threats and the assaults upon his father and himself and the former superior officer in Security, though he claimed as well that he also feared the LTTE (the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) because he apprehended some of their members when working in the police force before his transfer to the PSD in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
16 The Tribunal rejected the claim that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason by either the former director of the Security Division or by the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">These conclusions are not in issue in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">17 It was accepted that the appellant was a supporter of the SLFP and had been relatively active and quite prominent since 1983.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Tribunal also accepted "that he has experienced some level of mistreatment and harassment because of his political activities, the most serious incident being the assault in May 2002 ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">18 The Tribunal reviewed general information concerning the situation in Sri Lanka relating to political violence but concluded that:
 
 "Even though the applicant has been previously assaulted and has had some property damaged and has received threats (most of them being indirect) regarding future harm, this does not indicate that he has a well founded fear of persecution ... the applicant (and his father) has received many threats over a long period of time, yet they have not been carried out --- with the exception of the assault and property damage on the accused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">This provides me with a strong foundation for confidence that the threats are not a true indication of what may happen to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Rather they are attempts to unsettle the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">" 
 

This paragraph, I would interpolate, is central to the present appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">19 The Tribunal concluded also that the appellant could receive "adequate protection from the police".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">20 The Tribunal further said:
 
 "Finally, even if I accept all of the applicant's material claims ... the harm he fears from UNP supporters does not constitute persecution because it does not have an official quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">" 
 

21 Earlier in its reasons the Tribunal had stated --- conformably with a line of authority adopting and endorsing observations of Brennan CJ in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 at 233 --- that "the persecution must have an official quality, in the sense that it is official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the authorities of the country of nationality": see SZDWR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 36 at [18] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">22 Having referred to the harms the appellant fears from the UNP supporters as not constituting persecution because it does not have an "official quality", the Tribunal went on:
 
 "In this regard, I note the following remarks of Hely J in the Federal Court matter of S K M Habibur Rahman v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 73 (10 February 1999) wherein His Honour considered claims in relation to electoral violence in Bangladesh that appears similar to the situation in Sri Lanka: 
 
 
 
 Despite finding that violence was a pervasive part of the culture of political life in Bangladesh, RRT was of the view, based on the independent evidence, that members or supporters of the Jatiya Party were not subjected to treatment which could be characterised as persecution by members or supporters of other political parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Although RRT accepted that if the applicant returned to political activities upon returning to Bangladesh he could be harmed by members of other political parties, if that occurred, it would be in the context of acts of violence committed by members of all Bangladeshi political parties, and not as a result of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The fact that all political parties are from time to time involved in armed clashes with the police and with each other, as part of the political milieu of Bangladesh, does not mean that there is persecution within the meaning of the Convention, because the violence lacks the selective or discriminatory quality which is inherent in the notion of persecution, and because it lacks the requisite 'official' quality in the sense that it is official, or officially tolerated, or uncontrollable by the authorities of Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">" 
 
 
 

The application was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 
23 It is unnecessary to refer to His Honour's reasons dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The grounds of that application are replicated in the grounds of appeal of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">THE APPEAL 
 
24 Because the Tribunal did accept that the appellant had been assaulted (in 2002), had some property damage and had received threats (mostly indirect) regarding future harm, but nonetheless did not find he had a well-founded fear of persecution, I am asked to infer that (a) it did not correctly interpret or apply the "well-founded fear" component of the definition of a refugee; and (b) it did not consider that a pattern of repeated threats over a long period of time might itself amount to persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">25 Accepting that a jurisdictional error can be inferred from a conclusion reached despite factual findings, this is not a matter in which such an inference can be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Before indicating why this is so it is appropriate to refer to some well accepted principles that are applied when challenging on grounds of jurisdictional error determinations that a person does not satisfy the definition of a refugee for the purposes of the Migration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 (i) Whether particular conduct of which a person is shown to have a well-founded fear is sufficiently serious and significant as to constitute persecution properly understood, is a question of fact and degree for the Tribunal not the Court: VDAU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 32 at [24] ; see also Raheem v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 940 at [31] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">(ii) Whether threats of future harm are genuine and are sufficiently serious as to be capable of amounting to persecution (if intended to be acted upon and not merely to intimidate) are likewise questions of fact and degree for the Tribunal: VBAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212 ; (2005) 216 ALR 307 at [20] - [28] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(iii) Where the Tribunal has correctly formulated the test to be applied, a court should not take the view that the Tribunal did not apply the correct test unless this appears clearly from what it has written: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">(iv) The ultimate question for the Tribunal looks to the future and requires it to consider whether the fear of persecution upon return to the country in question is well founded: M66 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 112 at [13] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">(v) The Tribunal is not required, as an essential part of reaching its conclusion on whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution, to characterise past acts complained of as persecution: Ratnayake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1141.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">What has happened in the past may explain a present subjective fear and be a matter to be taken into account in the predictive exercise of determining whether there is a "real chance" of persecution for a Convention reason if that person is returned: Ratnayake ; Applicant A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 666 at [20] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">

26 Turning to the Tribunal's evaluation of the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution, it is clear that it made no finding and had no need to make a finding that the harm the appellant experienced in the past itself amounted to persecution, although it accepted he experienced the harm claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It equally is the case that the Tribunal made no finding that threats could not amount to persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Rather, having evaluated the threats actually made, it determined that even when coupled with the past harms, these did not sustain a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">27 These conclusions fell well within the Tribunal's proper province.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It made its judgment of the significance, seriousness and, in the case of the threats, the purpose of the conduct in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">As Sundberg J said in Das v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229 at [23]: "That the Court might not itself have taken the same view of the facts as the Tribunal does not establish error".</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">No reviewable error has been disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">28 Distinctly, the appellant claims that the Tribunal misunderstood the "official quality" that may be required in the course of persecution such as to constitute a person a refugee under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I already have indicated that the Tribunal's understanding of what was comprehended by the "official quality" requirement as expressly explained in its Reasons, was orthodox and unobjectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Before referring again to this matter towards the end of its reasons, the Tribunal found that despite his fears of harm at the hands of UNP supporters, the appellant could access and be provided with adequate State protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It is in this context that its comments on "official quality" are to be considered when it indicated that the harm the appellant fears from UNP supporters did not have an official quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">29 On a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, it is apparent that the Tribunal was intending to signify that such violence as occurs between members or supporters of political parties (which was the essence of the appellant's claims about the UNP supporters) did not amount to persecution, first because such violence was not official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the State and secondly, because it lacked the selective or discriminatory quality which is inherent in the notion of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">While each of these reasons was sufficient to justify a conclusion adverse to the appellant, the latter, the State protection finding, was independently dispositive of the appellant's entire claim in the circumstances: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Respondent S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487; SZBOT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 411 ; Applicant VFAH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1018.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">30 I do not consider that the reasons betray the misunderstanding alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">31 The ground relied upon in the Notice of Appeal is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">LEAVE TO AMEND 
 
32 As I noted at the outset, the circumstances in which the question of leave is raised are unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">They relate to the significance to be attributed to publication in the United States in early 2005 of a law journal article jointly authored by the Tribunal member and another person which argued that, in certain circumstances, State-sanctioned torture was morally justifiable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It will be necessary to refer below to the burden of that article, a copy of which has been put in evidence for the purpose of the leave application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">33 The appellant was not aware of the existence of this article at the time of the Tribunal hearing (which pre-dated its publication) or of the Federal Magistrate's decision (which was given at about the time of publication).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It is not, in consequence, a case of evidence not being called before the Federal Magistrate which was then accessible to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">34 The appellant's purpose in relying upon that article is not to enhance further the basis of his claims to refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Rather it is to impugn both the Tribunal hearing itself (on grounds of apprehended bias) and the Tribunal member's understanding of the term "persecution" for the purposes of the Convention and of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">35 So far as the principles governing the grant of leave are concerned, all I need note for present purposes are:
 
 (i) leave to argue a new ground of appeal should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at 319; and
 (ii) in considering whether it is so in the interests of justice, it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds proposed to determine whether they have a reasonable prospect of success: Iyer v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 at [22] - [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">

36 It has not been suggested in this matter that the respondent would be prejudiced by the grant of leave, nor is it said that there is no acceptable explanation for the issue not being previously raised: cf NAJT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 at [166] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">37 The respondent opposes leave primarily on the basis that the proposed grounds have no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">A subsidiary basis for opposition --- based on comments made in the joint judgment in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at [29] concerning the significance of lapse of time --- is to the following effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Given the member's views were published more than a year after the decision in question, it cannot be determined what the member's views may have been at the time of decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">This latter contention is not, in my view, of particular consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The article was published in a law journal in a foreign country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Inevitably that process would have involved delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It is equally clear from the structure of the article, the sources relied upon, and the nature of the debate with which it was engaging, that time was spent in its research and writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is improbable that its central thesis was not entertained by the Tribunal member, if only in rudimentary form, at the time when the appellant's review application was determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The article 
 
38 Given the view I take on the question of leave, it is necessary to refer in a little detail to the burden of the article itself (which runs to thirty-five pages).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">There are two comments I should make about it by way of preface.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The first is that the article's concern is not with torture at large (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">the infliction of severe pain, suffering or torment as such).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Rather it is with a particular sub-species of State-sanctioned or officially authorised torture (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">the State-sanctioned infliction of bodily pain etc for the purpose of persuading a person to provide information to avert a grave risk of loss of life).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I note in passing that the definitions of "torture" in The Oxford English Dictionary , vol XVIII, 278 (2 nd ed) reflect the above differences to the extent of recognising that torture may or may not be inflicted purposively and with State authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">39 The second comment is that the background to the article are the contemporary prevalence of State-sanctioned torture in many countries and its use by States for interrogative purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">40 The following extracts are sufficient to convey the article's tone and tenor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 " (i) [At pp 582-3] We argue that torture is indeed morally defensible, not just pragmatically desirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The harm minimization rationale is used to supplement our argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 While a 'civilized' community does not typically condone such conduct this Article contends that torture is morally defensible in certain circumstances, mainly when more grave harm can be avoided by using torture as an interrogation device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The pejorative connotation associated with torture should be abolished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">A dispassionate analysis of the propriety of torture indicates that it is morally justifiable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 
 (ii) [At p 584] Ultimately, torture is simply the sharp end of conduct whereby the interests of one agent are sacrificed for the greater good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">As a community, we are willing to accept this principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Thus, although differing in degree, torture is no different in nature from conduct that we sanction in other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It should be viewed in this light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 
 Given this, it is illogical to insist on a blanket prohibition against torture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Therefore, the debate must turn to the circumstances when torture is morally appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">This is the topic of this Article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 
 (iii) [At pp 596-7] Broadly, there are two types of normative moral theories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Consequential moral theories claim that an act is right or wrong depending upon its capacity to maximize a particular virtue, such as happiness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Non-consequential (or deontological) theories claim that the appropriateness of an action is not contingent upon its instrumental ability to produce particular ends, but rather follows from the intrinsic features of the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Thus, the notion of absolute (or near absolute) rights, which now dominates moral discourse, is generally thought to sit most comfortably in a non-consequentialist ethic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This section proves that torture is permissible pursuant to both of these ethical theories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It is only consequentialist theories, however, that provide a logical framework within which it is possible to demarcate the circumstances in which torture is permissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 (iv) [At p 607] By drawing comparisons with other situations in which we take the utilitarian option, it is contended that practices such as punishing the innocent and torture are not necessarily unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 The view that punishing the innocent and torturing individuals is the morally correct action in some circumstances is consistent with and accords with the decisions we as individuals and societies as a whole readily have made and continue to make when faced with extreme and desperate circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Once we come to grips with the fact that our decisions in extreme situations will be compartmentalized to desperate predicaments, we do, and should, though perhaps somewhat begrudgingly, take the utilitarian option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In the fact of extreme situations, we are quite ready to accept that one should, or even must, sacrifice oneself or others for the good of the whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 For example, in times of war we not only request our strongest and healthiest to fight to the death for the good of the community, but we often demand that they do so under threat of imprisonment or even death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 
 (v) [At p 611] The only situation where torture is justifiable is where it is used as an information gathering technique to avert a grave risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In such circumstances, there are five variables relevant in determining whether torture is permissible and the degree of torture that is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The variables are (1) the number of lives at risk; (2) the immediacy of the harm; (3) the availability of other means to acquire the information; (4) the level of wrongdoing of the agent; and (5) the likelihood that the agent actually does possess the relevant information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Where (1), (2), (4) and (5) rate highly and (3) is low, all forms of harm may be inflicted on the agent --- even if this results in death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 
 (vi) [At p 612] Torture violates the right to physical integrity, which is so important that it is only a threat to the right to life that can justify interference with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Thus, torture should be confined to situations where the right to life is imperiled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 (vii) [At p 615] The slippery slope argument in the context of torture holds that while torture might be justified in the extreme cases, legalizing it in these circumstances will invariably lead to torture in other less desperate situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 
 This argument is not sound in the context of torture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">First, the floodgates are already open --- torture is widely used, despite the absolute legal prohibition against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It is, in fact, arguable that it is the existence of an unrealistic absolute ban on torture that has driven torture "beneath the radar screen of accountability" and that the legalization of torture in very rare circumstances would, in fact, reduce the instances of torture because of the increased level of accountability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">
 
 Second, there is no evidence to suggest that the lawful violation of fundamental human interests will necessarily lead to a violation of fundamental rights where the pre-conditions for the activity are clearly delineated and controlled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 (viii) [At p 616] Conclusion 
 
 The absolute prohibition against torture is morally unsound and pragmatically unworkable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">There is a need for measured discussion regarding the merits of torture as an information gathering device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This would result in the legal use of torture in circumstances where there are a large number of lives at risk in the immediate future and there is no other means of alleviating the threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">While none of the recent high profile cases of torture appear to satisfy these criteria, it is likely that circumstances will arise in the future where torture is legitimate and desirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">A legal framework should be established to properly accommodate these situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">" 
 
 
 SHOULD LEAVE BE GRANTED?</sentence>

 (a) that when one considers published views of the Tribunal member that torture may be licit in some circumstances, it must necessarily follow that there is a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal, in interpreting and applying the definition of a refugee, which necessarily involves consideration of "persecution", may be biased in the sense of having a mind wrongly open to the possibility that a person may suffer significant injury and yet not be a refugee, because in the mind of the Tribunal member that injury either is not serious harm, or is lawfully inflicted; and 
 (b) the published views of the Tribunal member indicate that because he considers some forms of torture may in some circumstances be licit, he must be taken to have a different notion of persecution from that required by the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

42 The respondent, as I have noted, has contended that the new ground proposed has no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">That is my own view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">43 First, reasonably apprehended bias .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The test of whether the Tribunal member was disqualified from hearing the appellant's application for review on this basis is not in issue between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Both are content for present purposes to rely upon that of Deane J in Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67-68.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It is:
 
 "whether, in all the circumstances, a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material objective facts 'might entertain a reasonable apprehension that [the Tribunal member] might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question' in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">" 
 

Though the subject of the reasonable apprehension need only be of a possibility of bias, that reasonable apprehension must be "firmly established": R v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group [1969] HCA 10 ; (1969) 122 CLR 546, at 553.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In a case such as the present involving the significance to be attributed in the circumstances to expressed views, it is insufficient to demonstrate merely "a sense of unease or a feeling that conventions of discretion and prudence have been breached": Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka , at [90].</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">What needs to be established is a reasonable suspicion that an unprejudiced mind might not be brought to the determination of the appellant's case because of "preconceptions existing independently of the case": Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 372 - because of prejudgment or predisposition: Ex parte Epeabaka , at [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">I will for convenience refer to this as "issue bias".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">44 It is unnecessary here to enlarge at any length upon the rationale and purpose of the rule against bias as it applies to officers and agencies of public government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I need only note that, as with some number of other rules, it serves within its province to maintain public trust and confidence in our officials and agencies by imposing a standard of official conduct aimed at securing disinterested, impartial and unprejudiced official decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In so doing it imposes constraints and limitations on the freedoms and privileges of an official to which he or she would not be subject as of course as a private citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">45 Turning to the present matter, I do not accept that the article in question was capable of firmly establishing the reasonable apprehension contended for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">As I earlier noted, its concern was limited and particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It dealt with State-sanctioned torture for interrogative purposes with the object of averting likely loss of life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It did not advocate more generally torture in its multifarious possible forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">And while it advocated the legalizing of torture within a narrow province, it acknowledged that the infliction of torture beyond that province would continue to involve "a violation of fundamental rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">46 The argument so put is doubtless apt to engender a hostile response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The subject of torture, understandably, touches deeply the belief system of many members of the community and, hardly for some (particularly amongst holders of protection visas), their own experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The present case, though, is not about the acceptability or otherwise of the argument propounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Neither is it about the issue of the general suitability of the Tribunal member to be appointed to, or to continue to discharge, the function of a Tribunal member given that despite their confined scope, his expressed views nonetheless are related to the more general subject of torture which arises regularly in Tribunal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In my view the publication was imprudent and indiscrete for a person occupying the member's position on the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">But that, as I have noted, is not enough to make out issue bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">47 For the bias rule to avail the appellant there must be such a connection between the views expressed in the article and the issues determined by the Tribunal member in the appellant's case as to firmly establish the possibility of an operative preformed judgment in the determination of those issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">I do not consider there to be such a connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The particular sub-species of torture with which the article was concerned was not in issue in the appellant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">There is nothing in the article to suggest that the authors condoned the infliction of torture beyond the discrete area that they would wish to privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">They continue to accept that torture beyond that area would involve a violation of fundamental rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Accordingly, while expressing the views contained in the article may itself engender a sense of unease in the fair minded observer, the article is not capable in my view of satisfying the bias test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The member is not to be disqualified, absent some proper connection between the article and the issues determined by the Tribunal, simply because the burden of the article is likely to attract criticism and condemnation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The rule curtails freedom of speech, but only measuredly so for its own purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">48 Secondly, a different notion "of persecution" from that required by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The appellant's contention here involves little more than a re-packaging of the issue bias submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">There is, moreover, nothing to indicate that the views of the member expressed in the article, are reflected in some demonstrable error of the Tribunal in interpreting or applying the definition of "refugee" in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The article was not relevant to the interpretation and application of the definition given the case before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">49 Accordingly, I refuse leave to amend the Notice of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">CONCLUSIONS 
 
50 I order that the appeal be dismissed, that leave not be granted to amend the Notice of Appeal and that the appellant pay the respondent's costs of the appeal and of the application for leave to amend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">
 
 
 I certify that the preceding fifty (50) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>
