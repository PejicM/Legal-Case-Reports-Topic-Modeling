 INTRODUCTION 
 
3 The plaintiffs ("the Scheme Companies") apply for orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act ") that meetings of their respective creditors be convened for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, approving schemes of arrangement between them and those creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They also seek an order approving the form of the Explanatory Statement for the schemes, and providing for the manner in which the meetings are to be held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">4 The Scheme Companies are insurance companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Their businesses are in the nature of reinsurance and are in run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In broad terms, the purpose of each scheme is to accelerate the payment of reinsurance claims that have been made, or might be in the future, so as to resolve their potential reinsurance now, and to enable their businesses to be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">"CUT-OFF" OR "VALUATION" SCHEMES GENERALLY 
 
5 Schemes such as the present ones are referred to as "cut-off" or "valuation" schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">While there have been several in England in recent years, this appears to be only the second in Australia, the first being the subject of Conti J's judgment in Re Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) Ltd (" MMIA ") (2002) 196 ALR 362.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">6 Three general features of the proposed schemes may be noted:
 
&#8226; first, the liabilities of the Scheme Companies to be subject to the schemes are all reinsurance liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Accordingly, the "Scheme Creditors" will all be insurance companies or similar entities, that can be expected to be commercially sophisticated and knowledgeable, particularly in relation to the reinsurance considerations involved in any assessment of the schemes;
 
&#8226; secondly, the business of both companies has been in run-off for a long time; and
 
&#8226; thirdly, in the case of each Scheme Company there is a clear surplus of assets over liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">7 In my view, the Scheme Companies must establish:
 
 
 a. first , that all reasonable steps have been or will be taken to identify the Scheme Creditors and to bring the proposed schemes to the attention of all of them, and that it seems likely that their efforts in these respects will prove successful;
 b. secondly , that the Explanatory Statement for the proposed schemes provides an adequate description of their effect, and otherwise complies with s 412(1) of the Corporations Act ;
 c. thirdly , that the manner in which the proposed schemes will operate is not so clearly unfair and unreasonable that they should not be allowed to go forward for consideration;
 d. fourthly , that it is appropriate that there be, as proposed, a single meeting of all the Scheme Creditors of each Scheme Company as distinct from meetings of classes of Scheme Creditors;
 e. fifthly , that the way in which the value of Scheme Creditors' claims will be determined for the purposes of voting at the meeting of the Scheme Creditors for each Scheme Company is fair and reasonable;
 f. sixthly , that the proposed schemes comply with the requirements of other provisions of the Corporations Act , including the requirement of s 411(2) that 14 days' notice of the hearing of the application be given to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") and that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the proposed schemes and explanatory memorandum, and to make submissions to the Court in relation to them;
 g. seventhly , that the Scheme Companies have provided or will provide full disclosure concerning the proposed schemes, not only to the Scheme Creditors, to ASIC and to the Court, but also to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA"), and that APRA has also had a reasonable opportunity to examine the documents and to make submissions to the Court concerning them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 
 THE SCHEME COMPANIES 
 NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited 
 
8 NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited ("NRG London") is incorporated in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is an indirect subsidiary of ING Groep NV, a Netherlands incorporated and listed company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">9 NRG London was an active reinsurer until 1991, when it ceased underwriting new risks, and was placed into run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">10 As at 31 December 2005, NRG London had total assets of GBP 164,821,000 and total liabilities of GBP 108,500,000 (giving an excess of assets over liabilities of GBP 56,321,000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">NRG London (Australian Branch) 
 
11 NRG London is registered in Australia as a foreign corporation under Part 5B.2 of the Corporations Act and is licensed as a general insurer under the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ("the Insurance Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Registration of a foreign corporation under the Corporations Act does not create a new legal entity (s 601BM).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">However, because APRA regulates only the Australian operations of NRG London, it is necessary to distinguish between its Australian and non-Australian operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">12 APRA is concerned with the protection of NRG London's Australian policyholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">There is a general requirement under s 28 of the Insurance Act that insurers maintain "in Australia" (as to which see s 116A of that Act) assets at least equal to the value of their liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Prudential Standards made under the Insurance Act require foreign insurers to maintain assets in Australia in excess of their liabilities in Australia, in an amount at least equal to their "Minimum Capital Requirement": Prudential Standard GPS 110 , para 25 and Prudential Standard GPS 120 , para 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">NRG London must, therefore, maintain a balance sheet for its Australian operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The accounts so prepared depict the financial condition of a notional entity referred to as a "branch": see Prudential Standard GPS 110 , para.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">13 The notional division between NRG London's Australian operations and its other operations is reinforced by restrictions that APRA places on NRG London's ability to deal with its Australian assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">NRG London may not reduce its Australian assets (save to the extent of current-year profits) without APRA approval: Prudential Standard GPS 110 , paras.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">6 and 25; Guidance Note GGN 110.1 , paras 20-22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">14 In this way, APRA "quarantines" within Australia assets sufficient to meet NRG London's Australian liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">APRA is therefore able to ignore NRG London's non-Australian assets and liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">NRG London's Australian assets must not be applied, without APRA approval, towards satisfying its other non-Australian liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">(It is possible that NRG London's Australian policyholders may benefit from NRG London's non-Australian operations, in the sense that, at least so far as Australian law is concerned, NRG London remains obliged, and, subject to any contrary requirement of foreign law, able to apply its non-Australian assets towards satisfying its Australian liabilities).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">15 For the above reasons, it is convenient to refer to the "Australian branch" of NRG London ("NRG London (Australian Branch ) ") as if it were a separate legal entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">For the purposes of these proceedings, for example, because the liabilities of NRG London that are to be subject to the scheme are only those "in Australia", it is convenient to refer to them as liabilities of the NRG London (Australian Branch).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">16 NRG London (Australian Branch) was established in September 1973, and was an active reinsurer in the Australian market between 1974 and 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In 1991, NRG London (Australian Branch) was placed into run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Accordingly, it has now been in run-off for approximately the last 15 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">If the NRG London scheme is eventually implemented, NRG London (Australian Branch) will no longer be carrying on business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">17 As at 31 December 2005 NRG London (Australian Branch) had total assets of AUD 21,321,000 and total liabilities of AUD 7,211,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">(an excess of assets over liabilities of AUD 14,110,000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">NRG Victory Australia Limited 
 
18 NRG Victory Australia Limited ("NRG Victory") is incorporated in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It is also an indirect subsidiary of ING Groep NV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">19 NRG Victory was an active reinsurer in the Australian market between 1956 and 1993, writing both life insurance and reinsurance, and non-life reinsurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">20 In 1993, NRG Victory ceased underwriting new risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Unsuccessful attempts were made to sell the company as a composite insurer, and NRG Victory's life business was transferred to Life Reinsurance of Australia Limited pursuant to a scheme under the Life Insurance Act 1945 (Cth) ("the Life Insurance Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">NRG Victory's non-life reinsurance business remained and was placed into run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">21 Accordingly, NRG Victory's business has been in run-off for the last 12 to 13 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">If the NRG Victory scheme is eventually implemented, NRG Victory will no longer be carrying on business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">22 As at 31 December 2005, NRG Victory had total assets of AUD 47,268,000 and total liabilities of AUD 12,905,000 (an excess of assets over liabilities of 34,363,000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">THE PROPOSED SCHEMES 
 
23 With two exceptions, the two proposed schemes are identical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The first exception relates to the way in which the Scheme Creditors are defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The second relates to the value of Scheme Creditors' claims, above which the respective Scheme Companies have a discretion to terminate the scheme and to "revert to run-off".</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Scheme Creditors 
 
24 In each scheme, the Scheme Creditors are creditors of the particular Scheme Company in respect of a "Claim".</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">A person has a Claim against a Scheme Company if the Scheme Company has a liability to that person under a contract of reinsurance, unless the liability falls within the expression "Excluded Liabilities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">25 Each scheme defines Excluded Liabilities differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In the NRG London scheme, Excluded Liabilities are all liabilities of NRG London under contracts of reinsurance that were not written through NRG London (Australian Branch).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">26 In the NRG Victory scheme, Excluded Liabilities are all liabilities under contracts of life reinsurance that were transferred to Life Reinsurance of Australasia Limited by way of the scheme under the Life Insurance Act in late 1993 (mentioned at [18] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Strictly, it is unnecessary to exclude such liabilities, since NRG Victory is no longer liable on those contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">They were expressly excluded "for abundant precaution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Compromise or Arrangement 
 
27 In the absence of the proposed schemes, the Scheme Companies' liabilities to the Scheme Creditors would be discharged in response to the making and assessment of claims over a lengthy period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Under the proposed schemes, all potential entitlements to reinsurance indemnity that a Scheme Creditor has against a Scheme Company will be valued and paid out now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Process by which the Value of Claims will be Determined 
 
28 The first step in the determination of the value of Scheme Creditors' claims is the submission of a "Claim Form".</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">29 Where it has sufficient information to do so, the Scheme Company will pre-complete a Claim Form stating its estimate of the value of the Scheme Creditor's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">If the Scheme Creditor agrees with the estimate, it need take no further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">30 If the Scheme Company has not pre-completed a Claim Form, or if the Scheme Creditor disagrees with the Scheme Company's estimate, the Scheme Creditor will itself complete the Claim Form and submit it to the Scheme Company along with any relevant supporting information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">31 In order to assist the Scheme Companies, the Scheme Adjudicator (see below), and the Scheme Creditors in valuing claims, an "Estimation Methodology" has been prepared by Scott Collings, of Finity Consulting Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Collings is a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He is the actuary appointed by NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory pursuant to s 39 of the Insurance Act and approved by APRA pursuant to s 40 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Estimation Methodology is not a binding statement of the manner in which claims will be valued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It is, however, a statement of what Mr Collings believes is an appropriate actuarial approach to the valuation of most of the claims expected to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Estimation Methodology is set out in Section 5 of the Scheme Booklet to be distributed to Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">32 If the Scheme Company agrees with the value assigned by the Scheme Creditor, that amount will become the value of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">If the Scheme Company does not agree, and discussions do not produce agreement, the question of the value of the claim will be submitted to a "Scheme Adjudicator".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">33 The Scheme Adjudicator will consider all relevant information, may consult with advisers, such as actuaries and lawyers, and will determine the value of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">34 Once the value of a claim is agreed or is determined by the Scheme Adjudicator, the Scheme Company will deduct from that amount any amount owing by the Scheme Creditor to the Scheme Company, and pay the balance to the Scheme Creditor (in the unlikely event that there is a balance owing to the Scheme Company, the Scheme Creditor will have to pay that amount to the Scheme Company).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Reversion to Run-Off 
 
35 If the total amount of all claims exceeds a certain amount, the Scheme Company will have the option of terminating the Scheme and reverting to run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The amount is the amount for which provision for insurance liabilities has been made in the Scheme Company's accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">For NRG London (Australian Branch), that amount is $7,032,000, and for NRG Victory, it is $11,788,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">36 The provision for reversion to run-off gives reassurance that the Scheme Companies will not be rendered insolvent as a result of an unexpectedly high value of Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">37 The most significant potential detriment for a Scheme Creditor is the possibility that the value of a Scheme Creditor's claim will prove to be less than the amount of the indemnity to which the Scheme Creditor would have been entitled if run-off had continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">No doubt Scheme Creditors will take into account this disadvantage, and, on the other hand, the extent of the advantage to them of having money in hand, in determining whether to support the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Identification and Notification of Potential Scheme Creditors 
 
38 A review of the records of NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory has identified many potential Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There remains, however, the possibility that some may not have been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It must be remembered that we are considering insurers that entered into contracts of reinsurance with a Scheme Company prior to 1991 in the case of NRG London (Australian Branch), and prior to 1993 in the case of NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">39 The records of NRG London (Australian Branch) identify only policyholders who have been in contact with NRG London (Australian Branch) since 1 July 1989, in connection, for example, with the payment or receipt of money, the provision of advice regarding premiums, or the notification of a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The records of NRG Victory disclose only the identity of all policyholders who have been in contact with it since 1 January 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">40 Both Scheme Companies have, however, also made inquiries of managers or agents of various underwriting pools regarding the identity of any remaining claimants on the pools.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">41 In summary, all potential Scheme Creditors of both Scheme Companies have been identified except for any who have not had any contact with NRG London (Australian Branch) since 1 July 1989 or with NRG Victory since 1 January 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">42 Most potential claimants on NRG London (Australian Branch) and on NRG Victory are Australian insurance companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Other potential claimants are Australian entities that are not authorized insurers (such as government insurance offices and self-insurers), and some New Zealand, Papua New Guinean and Pacific Islands entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">43 In order to ensure that those possible further Scheme Creditors learn of the respective schemes, NRG London and NRG Victory will send copies of the Scheme Booklet to all authorised insurers in Australia, and to all brokers who have, to their knowledge, written business for NRG London (Australian Branch) or NRG Victory, as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">44 NRG London and NRG Victory will also advertise the respective schemes in newspapers in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Those advertisements will provide contact details for potential Scheme Creditors to make inquiries and to obtain copies of the Scheme Booklet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">45 There is a further category of policyholders who may be Scheme Creditors of NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Between 1970 and 1974, NRG Victory accepted general insurance risks in South East Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It appears from the records of NRG Victory that this business was transferred to another company in 1974.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It is not, however, possible to be certain that it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">46 No claims emanating from South East Asia have been made on NRG Victory, and no contact with NRG Victory has been made on behalf of any South East Asian policyholder since at least 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">47 Given the apparent transfer of the South East Asian business to another company, and the lack of any known claims history, it is perhaps unnecessary that any steps be taken to notify potential South East Asian Scheme Creditors of NRG Victory, but in fact the NRG Victory scheme will be advertised in a newspaper in Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Scheme Booklet 
 
48 Because of the similarity between the two schemes, only one Scheme Booklet has been prepared for distribution to the Scheme Creditors under both schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">This does not trouble me: the differences between the proposed schemes are so minor that a potential Scheme Creditor under one scheme will not be confused or misled by the presence in the Scheme Booklet of a discussion concerning the other scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">49 The Scheme Booklet provides a comprehensive statement of:
 
 
 (a) the way in which the schemes will operate;
 (b) the principal advantages and disadvantages of the schemes;
 (c) the financial circumstances of the Scheme Companies;
 (d) the steps required to be taken by potential Scheme Creditors in relation to the schemes, and the meetings at which the Schemes will be considered for approval; and
 (e) the absence of any interest on the part of the directors of the Scheme Companies that may be affected by the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 


 
50 The Scheme Booklet has been provided to APRA and ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Certain parts of the Scheme Booklet constitute the Explanatory Statement for the schemes: see Corporations Act ss 411(1) , 412 (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Estimation Methodology 
 
51 The Estimation Methodology provides for a different approach to the valuation of claims, depending upon whether they are "property damage", "specific incident" or "latent injury" claims, and upon whether the claims are "known" or "incurred but not reported" ("IBNR").</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">52 For property damage claims and specific incident claims that are known, the value will be the Scheme Creditor's estimate of the value of the particular claim, that is to say, the amount recorded by the Scheme Creditor as the expected settlement cost of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">53 For IBNR property damage claims and IBNR specific incident claims, no methodology has been prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">This is because it is considered unlikely that there will be any IBNR claims, and it will be incumbent upon a Scheme Creditor to prove that it has or may have such a claim, and how it should best be valued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">54 For latent injury claims, the valuation methodology applicable to known and IBNR claims will be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">That is because both types of latent injury claims share certain features which make their valuation a similar exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">For example, even once the total damage suffered by an individual as a result of exposure to asbestos is known, there are likely to be questions of "sharing", both as between defendants and as between insurers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">That is to say, because a person may have been exposed to asbestos from different sources and over a lengthy period of time, a Scheme Company may have an exposure only in respect of certain years or certain sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">As a result, liability for any one claim will usually be apportioned between different entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The same considerations apply to IBNR asbestos claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">55 The approach adopted by the Estimation Methodology to the valuation of latent injury claims is to permit the Scheme Creditor a wide discretion as to the way in which it will substantiate its claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Estimation Methodology indicates that information should be supplied to establish such matters as the nature of the exposure, the number of policyholders likely to be affected, and the likely frequency of claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The value of latent injury claims will be determined on the basis of the supporting information supplied by the Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">56 In all cases, there will be no discount applied to the value of a claim as a result of the proposed early payment, provided the claim is projected to settle within five years of the "Valuation Date" (30 June 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">For claims that are projected to settle after 30 June 2011, the value of the claim will be discounted by 5.5% per annum, but only for the period from 30 June 2011 to the date of projected settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Classes of Creditors 
 
57 Subsection 411(1) of the Corporations Act empowers the Court to order a meeting or meetings of creditors "or class of creditors" to be convened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There will be a separate meeting for each Scheme Company's Scheme Creditors (cf Re Safety Fix Pty Ltd [1962] VR 467 at 470), but it is not proposed to convene separate meetings for classes of Scheme Creditors of the one Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">58 Are there classes of Scheme Creditors for which separate meetings should be convened?</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">59 If the answer to this question is yes, the proposed scheme to be considered at the class meetings would remain unchanged: there would be no change in the definition of the Scheme Creditors and there would not be a different scheme for each class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The scheme would be binding on either class only if agreed to by the necessary majority of the meeting of that class: see Corporations Act s 411(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">60 Unless the scheme were to be changed to stipulate that it could proceed as binding on only one class of Scheme Creditors, such as the IBNR Scheme Creditors (see below), the scheme would become binding only if agreed to by both classes at their separate meetings: in effect, each class would have a right of veto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">This would be so, even if, for example, the total value of the claims of non-IBNR Scheme Creditors was quite small compared to the value of the total value of the claims of IBNR Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(In passing, it should be noted that s 411(5) , which provides for an aggregation of the votes cast at separate meetings has no application: that subsection applies to multiple meetings of "creditors" or of the same "class of creditors, not to the separate meetings that necessarily arise from the existence of classes of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">)
 
61 Counsel for the Scheme Companies have fairly raised for the Court's consideration two possible bases for the ordering of separate meetings of classes of creditors:
 
&#8226; first, the distinction between IBNR and other Scheme Creditors;
 
&#8226; secondly, the distinction between Scheme Creditors that are, and those that are not, indebted to the Scheme Company, giving rise to a set off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">62 I turn to the first possible basis of classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Non-IBNR claims are to be valued at the settlement cost placed on them by the Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Therefore, if the circumstances giving rise to the Scheme Company's reinsurance liability under a claim have occurred and been reported, the Scheme Creditor will receive the amount that it would have received in the ordinary course by way of indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Scheme Creditor will be in the same position as it would have been in if the Scheme Company had continued in run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">IBNR Scheme Creditors, on the other hand, would be in a different position than that in which they would have been under a run-off, because their future (and contingent) claims will be valued and they will be paid out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">As Lewison J observed in Re British Aviation Insurance Co Ltd [2005] EWHC 1621 (" BAIC ") (at [83]), "barring a miracle, the valuation will not be the same as the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">"
 
63 The significance of the notion of a "class" of creditors in the present context has been considered in several cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In Sovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd [1892] 2 QB 573 (" Sovereign Life "), Lord Esher MR said (at 579---580):
 
 " The Act says that the persons to be summoned to the meeting (all of whom, be it said in passing, are creditors) are persons who can be divided into different classes --- classes which the Act of Parliament recognises, though it does not define them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">This, therefore, must be done: they must be divided into different classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">What is the reason for such a course?</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It is because the creditors composing the different classes have different interests; and, therefore, if we find a different state of facts existing among different creditors which may differently affect their minds and their judgment, they must be divided into different classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">" 

In the same case, Bowen LJ said (at 583) that a "class":
 
 " must be confined to those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">" 

64 More recently, in Re Hills Motorway Ltd (2002) 43 ACSR 101 (" Hills Motorway "), Barrett J observed (at 104) that:
 
 "The test is thus not one of identical treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It is one of community of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The court must ask itself whether the rights and entitlements of the different groups, viewed in the totality of the scheme's context, are so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The focus is not on the fact of differentiation but on its effects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The extent and nature of the differentiation must be measured in terms of the effect on the ability to consult together in a common interest or, in other words, the ability to come together in a single meeting and to debate the question of what is good or bad for the constituency as a whole and where the common good lies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Only if the differentiation destroys that ability --- the word used by Bowen LJ is 'impossible' --- does class distinction come to prevail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">"

<sentence id="s145">65 In MMIA , Conti J referred (at [18], [19]) to "the class question" in the circumstances of a scheme generally similar to the present schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">His Honour referred to Sovereign Life , Hills Motorway , and Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 241 ; [2001] 2 BCLC 480 at 527, and, applying Bowen LJ's "impossibility of consulting together" test, held that a single meeting of all creditors was appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">66 In BAIC , Lewison J considered (at [83]) that on the facts of that case, policyholders with "known" or "accrued" claims constituted a separate class from policyholders with IBNR claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">His Lordship said (at [92]):
 
 "In my judgment in the particular circumstances of a solvent scheme, where a solvent liquidation is not a realistic alternative, those with accrued claims and those with IBNR claims have interests which are sufficiently different as not to make it possible for them sensibly to consult together "in their common interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In truth, they do not have a common interest at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">" 

67 The decision in BAIC has not, however, been treated as deciding that policyholders with accrued claims must always be treated as constituting a separate class from policyholders with IBNR claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In Re NRG Victory Reinsurance Ltd [2006] EWHC 679 (' NRG Victory '), in which the circumstances were very similar to those of the present case, Lindsay J took the view that there was only one class of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">His Lordship said (at [17]):
 
 "Whether separate classes for ['accrued' and IBNR claims] are truly necessary will depend on a long list of variables such that what is right for one company and one scheme will not necessarily be right for another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Where insurance companies are concerned, much will depend on matters such as the types of business which they covered and in what proportions between those classes of business; whether the business conducted was direct insurance or reinsurance and in what proportions; in what parts of the world, even, that their claimants are to be found; their solvency margins; how recently and when they stopped writing such new business as they used to write; the various times, class by class of business, at which they stopped; how long, accordingly, they have been in run-off and what has been their commutation experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">" 

68 Finally, in Re Sovereign Marine &amp; General Insurance Co Ltd [2006] EWHC 1335 (" Sovereign Marine "), Warren J also emphasised that each case depends on its own facts (see, for instance, [114]), and ordered the convening of a single meeting of creditors to consider a "cut-off" scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">69 BAIC is distinguishable on its facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In particular, the creditors in that case were not, as they are here, all insurance companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Indeed, "about 92 percent of its asbestos liabilities [were] owed to direct insureds": BAIC at [6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">70 In the present case, the following features suggest the appropriateness of convening a meeting of only one class of creditors:
 
 (a) The businesses in question are exclusively in the nature of reinsurance: the Scheme Creditors, all being insurers, can be expected to be commercially sophisticated and knowledgeable and to be able to assess where their best interests lie (in Sovereign Marine , Lindsay J regarded this consideration as a relevant distinction from the facts of BAIC );
 (b) The whole of the reinsurance businesses (being in fact the whole businesses) of NRG London (Australian Branch) and NRG Victory will be subject to the schemes (as opposed to merely a part of those businesses being subject to the schemes);
 (c) The reinsurance businesses of the Scheme Companies have been in run-off for over twelve years (as opposed to a short period of run-off, with corresponding uncertainty about, or instability in, the portfolio's experience).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">(d) Both Scheme Companies have assets significantly in excess of their liabilities (so that all policyholders can be confident of receiving payment in full on their claims).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">(e) It is not expected that there will be many (or any) IBNR claims for property damage or specific incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">It is expected that there will be IBNR claims for latent injuries, but in that case Mr. Collings has given evidence that the approach to determining both known and IBNR claims is similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">That is to say, in each case the approach is to determine the value of the claim in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">(f) There is no suggestion that the value of any of the Scheme Companies' IBNR claims will be unable to be estimated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">

71 In my opinion, so far as the evidence reveals, it will be possible for Scheme Creditors of both IBNR and non-IBNR descriptions to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It is not conclusive that the non-IBNR Scheme Creditors, or some of them, may be expected to think it immaterial to them whether the Scheme proceeds or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">72 For the above reasons, I do not think it appropriate to order separate meetings of IBNR and non-IBNR Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">73 It should be emphasised that if the meetings reveal a relevant problem, it will remain open to the Court not to approve the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Indeed, although the observations made by Lewison J in BAIC related to the convening stage, in fact in that case the meeting of creditors had already been held and the question of the appropriateness of the single meeting as against class meetings was being dealt with at the approval hearing, at which some creditors appeared to oppose the granting of the approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Indeed, in NRG Victory , Lindsay J observed (at [15]): 
 
 "... until the creditors have in fact had the opportunity of meeting and consulting together, it will be exceptionally difficult to be sure whether it will prove impossible or not for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It is a somewhat broad test and there could well be cases where the creditors, given the chance to meet, prove more flexible, cohesive or mutually accommodating than their respective lawyers ahead of the event would have expected and that creditors, even lumped together, find no unfairness and more that is in common between them than might have been thought to be divisive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">" 

74 As noted above, the other basis on which it might be suggested that meetings of classes of the Scheme Creditors are called for is that some Scheme Creditors will have a debt owing by them to the Scheme Companies set off against the value of their Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">One (albeit unlikely) consequence of the application of a set-off is that the Scheme Creditor may be indebted to the Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">75 The fact of the existence of a set-off does not, however, change the fundamental nature of the compromise between the Scheme Company and the Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In all cases, the issue to be decided by the Scheme Creditors is whether they wish to have their claims "accelerated" and valued now, or to call on their reinsurance indemnity in the ordinary course of run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It is by no means "impossible" for Scheme Creditors to discuss and consider that issue in circumstances where some of them will have countervailing amounts set off against their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">76 For these reasons, I think that it is appropriate for only one meeting of the Scheme Creditors of each Scheme Company to be convened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Determination of Value for Voting at Meetings 
 
77 The process by which the value of Scheme Creditors' claims will be determined for the purposes of voting at the scheme meetings is set out in the Scheme Booklet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Where a Scheme Company has sufficient information to make its own determination of the value of a Scheme Creditor's claim, it will pre-complete that Scheme Creditor's Claim Form, inserting an estimated value of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Scheme Creditor may accept that value, or it may reject it and specify a different value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">78 The value of claims for voting purposes will be determined by the Chairperson of the meeting of Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">That decision will be based on:
 
 (a) Information provided by the Scheme Creditor;
 (b) Information available to the Scheme Company from its records; and
 (c) Advice from the Scheme Actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">

79 The advice of the Scheme Actuary, who is the Scheme Companies' authorised actuary, Mr Collings, will ensure that the Chairperson will have available to him or her the advice of a suitably qualified and independent expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That advice will be based upon the principles set out in the Estimation Methodology, referred to earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">80 Finally, any remaining concern will, of course, be able to be raised by a Scheme Creditor at the confirmation hearing or, if it is applicable, pursuant to s 1321 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Compliance with the Corporations Act 
 
81 The proposed schemes do not contravene the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In particular, the proposed Explanatory Statement complies with s 112(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Disclosure to APRA and ASIC 
 
82 Full details of the Schemes have been provided in a timely manner to both APRA and ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In particular, the Scheme Booklet, incorporating the Explanatory Statement and the proposed schemes, has been provided to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">83 Both APRA and ASIC were notified of the date of the hearing, and indicated that they did not intend to appear to oppose the making of the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">CONCLUSION 
 
84 Orders as sought should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I certify that the preceding eighty-two (82) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>

 LETTER FROM THE SCHEME COMPANIES 
 
 NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited (ABN 77 001 160 792) 
 NRG Victory Australia Limited (ABN 47 002 971 477) 
 5 July 2006
 
Dear Scheme Creditor
 Proposed Schemes of Arrangement 
We are writing to you concerning separate solvent schemes of arrangement that NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited (NRG London) and NRG Victory Australia Limited (NRG Victory) propose to enter into with their respective Scheme Creditors pursuant to section 411 of the Corporations Act (the Schemes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The primary objective of the Schemes is to conclude the run-off of all business of NRG Victory and all business of NRG London written through its Australian branch at an earlier stage than would otherwise be possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The NRG London (Australian branch) Scheme will not relate to any business of NRG London that was not written through its Australian branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">This objective will be achieved by establishing an accelerated Claims agreement process whereby all Claims by Scheme Creditors against each Scheme Company, including future and contingent Claims, will be valued, finally determined and paid in full earlier than would be possible through a normal run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">
 Purpose of this document 
 This Scheme Booklet will summarise, amongst other things: 

(a) the advantages and possible disadvantages of the Schemes (Section 2 and in particular Section 2.6 and 2.7); and
(b) the main provisions of the Schemes (Section 3); and
 
(c) background information in relation to the Scheme Companies and the business proposed to be included in the Schemes (Section 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">These summaries are a guide only and should not be relied upon instead of reading the terms of the Schemes set out in Section 6 and the notices of the Scheme Meetings which are due to be held on 15 August 2006 at the offices of Clayton Utz, Level 34, No 1 O'Connell Street, Sydney NSW 2000 commencing at 10:00 am in the case of NRG London, and 10:30 am in the case of NRG Victory set out in Section 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Steps to be taken by the Scheme Creditor 
 
 On or before the Scheme Meeting: 
 
 &#8226; read the Scheme Booklet in its entirety; &#8226; complete and return the proxy and voting form so that it is received no later than 5:00 pm (Sydney time) on 11 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Proxy and voting forms may also be handed in at the registration desk at the relevant Scheme Meeting prior to the commencement of the Scheme Meetings (see Section 2.9); and &#8226; attend the relevant Scheme Meeting(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The Scheme Meetings will be held on 15 August 2006 at the offices of Clayton Utz, Level 34, No 1 O'Connell Street, Sydney NSW 2000, commencing at 10:00 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">

The Scheme Companies will notify Scheme Creditors once the Schemes become effective and will place advertisements in The Australian, The Australian Financial Review, The National Business Review (NZ), The New Straits Times, Papua New Guinea Post-Courier and other national newspapers distributed in the Pacific Islands calling for Scheme Creditors to complete and submit Claim Forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Where the Scheme Company has sufficient information to do so, it will pre-complete each Claim Form sent to any Scheme Creditor known to it at the Effective Date with an estimate of the value of the Claims of the Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It will not pre-complete an amount with respect to IBNR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Once notified that the Schemes have become effective:
 
 &#8226; if you agree with the pre-completed amounts on the Claim Form, you are not required to submit a Claim Form or provide any supporting information; &#8226; if you do not agree with the pre-completed amounts, you are required to complete or correct and submit the Claim Form (with supporting information) by the Claims Submission Date being 11:59 pm, Sydney time, on the first business day falling 120 days after (and not including) the Effective Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 Consequences if Schemes become effective 
 If a Scheme becomes effective between a Scheme Company and its Scheme Creditors, the Scheme Company will, from that date (the Effective Date): 

(a) cease to adjust Claims as they arise in the ordinary course of conducting its Scheme Business; and 
 
(b) seek to agree a "once-and-for-all" valuation of each Scheme Creditor's Claim (including previously unquantified and/or un-notified Claims).</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In order to qualify for payments under the Scheme, Scheme Creditors must duly submit their Claim Form in accordance with the Scheme by the Claims Submission Date, that is, no later than 11:59 pm Sydney time on the first business day falling 120 days after (but not including) the Effective Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Each Scheme Company will endeavour to agree the value of the Scheme Creditor's Claim with the Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">If the valuations of such Claims cannot be agreed, they will be determined by the Scheme Adjudicator in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme, with limited rights of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Claims which are agreed or determined in this way will become Agreed Claims (Pre Set-Off).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Once a Claim becomes an Agreed Claim (Pre Set-Off), set-off and other relevant deductions as described in Section 2.9 will be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The amount of the Scheme Creditor's Claim after such deductions will become the Scheme Creditor's "Final Determined Claim".</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Final Determined Claims will be paid in full at the values so agreed between the applicable Scheme Company and Scheme Creditor, or as otherwise determined in accordance with the applicable Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">In short, each Scheme, will effect a mass commutation between the Scheme Company and its Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Separate Schemes 
It should be noted that each Scheme is in law a separate scheme of arrangement and is independent of the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">As a result: 
 
(a) neither Scheme Company will have any liability or responsibility for the other Scheme Company's liabilities or obligations under the other Scheme Company's Scheme; and
 
(b) it is possible for one Scheme to become effective, even if the other Scheme does not become effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Directors Recommendation 
 The directors of each Scheme Company consider that its Scheme will offer its Scheme Creditors the most effective and economical method for having their Claims against it determined and paid in the shortest practicable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">
 All Scheme Creditors who are entitled to vote at the Creditors' Meetings are encouraged to vote in favour of the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">
Yours sincerely


 Ross Littlewood 
 (agent for and on behalf of NRG London Reinsurance Company Limited, Australian branch and director of NRG Victory Australia Limited) 

 ESTABLISHING THE SCHEMES 
 
 This Section summarises why the Schemes have been proposed, their advantages and disadvantages, and sets out the process for the Scheme Meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Section 3 summarises the terms of the Schemes if they become effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 The primary objective of each Scheme is to terminate the run-off of Reinsurance Contracts written by each Scheme Company much earlier than would be the case if Claims were left to mature in the normal course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Each Scheme establishes a method by which the present and future Claims of the Scheme Creditors will be valued as at the Valuation Date, 30 June 2006, and paid in full at the values agreed or determined in accordance with the provisions of the Schemes, at the earliest possible opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">A scheme of arrangement, such as that proposed here, is a compromise or arrangement between a company or a registered foreign company and its creditors (or any class of them), entered into pursuant to section 411 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">A scheme of arrangement becomes legally binding on a company or a registered foreign company and its affected creditors if: 
 a majority in number representing not less than 75% in value of the creditors, or any class of creditors, present and voting in person or by proxy, vote in favour of the scheme of arrangement at a meeting specially convened with the leave of the Court; 
 
 the Court subsequently sanctions the scheme of arrangement; and 
 
 an office copy of the order of the Court sanctioning the Scheme is lodged with ASIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">
 APPLICATION OF SCHEMES 
 
 Each Scheme is proposed between a Scheme Company and its respective Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 Scheme Creditor is defined in the Scheme itself but, in summary, will be restricted to those persons who have, or may in the future have a Claim against a Scheme Company in respect of a Liability under a Reinsurance Contract written by or on behalf of the Scheme Company other than an Excluded Liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">This will include liabilities under or arising out of: 
 
 all reinsurance contracts written by or on behalf of NRG Victory or NRG London written through its Australian branch; 
 
 in the case of the Australian branch of NRG London, its membership of ANIP; and 
 
 in the case of NRG Victory, its membership of ANIP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">
 
 Excluded Liabilities are defined in each Scheme and in summary are: 
 in the case of NRG London, reinsurance contracts and insurance contracts written by NRG London other than through its Australian branch; and 
 
(b) in the case of NRG Victory, reinsurance contracts which were transferred to Life Reinsurance of Australasia in 1993 (now Hannover Life Re of Australasia Ltd) under the Life Insurance Act 1945 and upon transfer, effectively ceased to be a liability of NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">
 The Scheme Business is described in greater detail in Section 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Each of the Scheme Companies is proposing a Scheme and each such Scheme is, in law, a separate Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">A Scheme Company does not have any liability or responsibility for the other Scheme Company's liabilities or obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Each such Scheme is capable of becoming effective whether or not the other Scheme becomes effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Scheme Creditors should note that once a Scheme becomes effective, it will bind the applicable Scheme Company in respect of which it has become effective and all its Scheme Creditors worldwide, irrespective of whether they were notified of the Scheme and/or the Scheme Meetings or not and/or whether they voted at the Scheme Meeting or not, and if they voted, whether they voted for or against the relevant Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">
 CREDITORS NOT COVERED BY THE SCHEMES 
 
 Each Scheme will: 
 not affect any creditor of a Scheme Company other than a Scheme Creditor; and 
 
 only affect Scheme Creditors in respect of their Claims, net of any deduction or set-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">
 
 Creditors who are not Scheme Creditors will not be entitled to attend or vote at the Scheme Meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">As the Scheme Companies are solvent, the Scheme Companies intend to continue to pay these creditors in the normal course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">
 PERSONS NOTIFIED OF THE SCHEMES 
 
 A copy of this Scheme Booklet has been made available to: 
 
 &#8226; all parties who, according to a Scheme Company's records, have or may have a Claim under an insurance or reinsurance contract written by, or on behalf of the Scheme Company; &#8226; the manager of ANIP, ANIP Pty Ltd, for distribution to such persons as it sees fit; &#8226; all licensed Australian general insurers; and &#8226; all brokers identified as having been involved in placing and/or administering business with a Scheme Company other than in respect of Excluded Liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">
 
 The Scheme Companies would be grateful if those brokers provided with a copy of the Scheme Booklet would inform their clients of the Schemes to ensure that, wherever possible, each and every Scheme Creditor is notified of the Schemes and the action that it is required to take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The fact that this Scheme Booklet has been made available to you does not necessarily mean that you are a Scheme Creditor or that you will be affected by either Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">You may also wish to ask your broker for further details about your possible involvement with the Scheme Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">
 REASONS FOR THE SCHEMES 
 
 Each Scheme Company expects the run-off of its Scheme Business to continue for a considerable number of years and, as a result, believes that its Scheme will be the most effective method of making full payment to its Scheme Creditors in the shortest practicable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Each Scheme will have the effect of concluding the run-off of the applicable Scheme Business earlier than would be the case if it were to continue until all Claims materialise and are agreed and paid in the normal course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Each Scheme Company considers that all of its Final Determined Claims will be paid in full, based on its present financial condition assuming all Claims were to run to their natural expiry and taking into account the anticipated costs of running-off the Scheme Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">There is, however, no absolute guarantee that each Scheme Company will have sufficient financial resources to settle all of its Final Determined Claims in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">As at 31 December 2005, NRG London's net asset position was as set out in the table below:

<sentence id="s289">
 THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF EACH SCHEME 
 
 Each Scheme Company considers that its Scheme will be advantageous to its Scheme Creditors for the reasons including: 
 Early payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The Scheme should enable its Scheme Creditors to have their Claims agreed or determined as Final Determined Claims and paid in full considerably sooner than if the run-off of the Scheme Company was to continue until all Claims mature and are paid in the ordinary course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">If Claims are determined or agreed under the Scheme as Final Determined Claims, they can be paid as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It is anticipated that payments to Scheme Creditors with Final Determined Claims will commence within one month of the Effective Date; 
 
No discount for early payment unless projected settlement date of Claim is greater than 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Administration costs which would have been incurred in running off the Scheme Company's relevant books of business over many years should be reduced materially by the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">In recognition of this, the Scheme Company is committing to pay Claims without discount for the time value of money, provided that the Claim is projected to settle within 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Claims with a projected settlement date greater than 5 years will be discounted, including Claims in respect of latent diseases (further details regarding this are set out in Section 5 dealing with the Estimation Methodology).</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">The same discount arrangement will apply to amounts determined to be owing by the Scheme Creditor to the Scheme Company for the purposes of set-off; 
 
Certainty and costs savings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The Scheme should enable its Scheme Creditors to achieve finality in respect of any Claims regarding the Scheme Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Any concerns which Scheme Creditors may have over the continuation of a Scheme Company's run-off, or over the long-term future solvency of a Scheme Company, will be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Scheme Creditors will also benefit from reduced costs in administering their Claims against the applicable Scheme Company over a lengthy period; and 
 
Proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Each Scheme is designed to enable Claims to be dealt with quickly and without protracted litigation, as each Scheme prohibits (without the prior written consent of the relevant Scheme Company), the commencement or continuation of any proceedings outside the mechanisms of the Schemes, where the purpose of such proceedings is to obtain payment of a Claim, or to establish the existence or quantum of a Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">
 
 In addition to the advantages listed above, each Scheme Company has sought to facilitate the Claims submission and determination process in the following ways: 
 Practical Claims submission process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">A Scheme Creditor may submit and continually revise its Claims up to the Claims Submissions Date (provided that it has not been notified that its Claim has been agreed by the Scheme Company in the meantime).</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Also, Scheme Creditors may elect to incorporate into their Claim Form, the Claims information which they had already included in their proxy and voting form (for the purpose of voting at the Scheme Meetings), by simply checking the applicable proxy and voting form election box on their Claim Form and resubmitting the Claim Form; 
 
Simplified Claims agreement process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Each Scheme will provide a practical and cost-effective process for agreeing all present and future Claims (including those which may not easily be evaluated, such as incurred but not reported losses (IBNR)), by way of a transparent Estimation Methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The Estimation Methodology is set out in Section 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The Estimation Methodology has been developed by Scott Collings, the Scheme Actuary, who is also the approved actuary for the Australian branch of NRG London and NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Mr Collings is a director of the actuarial firm 'Finity Consulting Pty Limited'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Mr Collings prepared the Actuarial Valuation Report of Insurance Liabilities of both the Australian branch of NRG London and NRG Victory as at 31 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 The Estimation Methodology provides Scheme Creditors with guidance on how all Claims (including Notified Outstanding Claims and IBNR) should be calculated and supported for specific types of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">In the event that agreement cannot be reached between a Scheme Company and a Scheme Creditor in relation to a Claim, the Scheme provides for the final and binding determination of that Claim by the Scheme Adjudicator in what is intended to be a fair and efficient manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">
 POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES OF THE SCHEMES 
 
 Scheme Creditors should also be aware of the following possible disadvantages in considering the Schemes: 
 Estimation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The simplified Claims agreement process has been designed to deal with Claims (including Notified Outstanding Claims and IBNR) as accurately and fairly as possible (see the main advantages discussed at Section 2.6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The effect of each Scheme will be to commute and terminate a Scheme Creditor's policy with a Scheme Company in return for a once-and-for-all payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">This process will result in certain Claims being estimated, which creates the risk that Scheme Creditors may receive a different amount (either more or less) in respect of their Claims, than would have been the case had the Scheme Business been run-off in the traditional way; 
 
Failure to submit Claim Form(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">To facilitate the acceleration and payment of Claims, each Scheme provides a mechanism for cutting-off Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">All Claims must be duly submitted on the Claim Form for proportional, non-proportional and IBNR Claims on or prior to the Claims Submission Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Claims notified after the Claims Submission Date will be valued at an amount limited to the value of the Scheme Creditor's Claim which had already been finally agreed by the relevant Scheme Company on or before the Effective Date and which remains unpaid (if any).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Such amounts will be sent to the relevant Scheme Creditor upon a request being made to Ross Littlewood (see page 3 above for contact details).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">For the avoidance of doubt, only amounts which have been pre-completed by the relevant Scheme Company on the relevant Scheme Creditor's Claim Form are considered by the relevant Scheme Company to be "finally agreed" for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">To the extent that a Scheme Creditor has no such "finally agreed" Claim, its Claim will be valued at zero, and the relevant Scheme Company will have no further liabilities to it in respect of its Scheme Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">If a Scheme Creditor wishes to receive payment in respect of any other amounts, it must submit a Claim Form, providing the necessary information in respect of its Claims, prior to the Claims Submission Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Scheme Creditors will not be able to change their Claim Form after the earlier of the Claims Submission Date, and the date they have been notified that their Claim has become an Agreed Claim (Pre Set-Off); and 
 
Impact on Scheme Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The Schemes may result in certain large IBNR Claims being submitted, or further information being provided in respect of known Claims, which may significantly increase the Liabilities of the Scheme Companies in respect of the Scheme Business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Theoretically, this could prejudice Scheme Creditors whose Claims are agreed and settled later than others if this material adverse change impacted on the Scheme Companies capacity to pay any remaining Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">However, the Scheme Companies do not believe this is a significant risk given the significant surplus of assets over liabilities of the Scheme Companies, and the capacity of the Scheme Companies to revert to run-off (described in Section 3.17 below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">
 
 Sections 2.6 and 2.7 above, set out the main advantages, and possible disadvantages, of the Schemes for Scheme Creditors identified by the Scheme Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">It is impossible, however, to address each Scheme Creditor's individual circumstances, and as such, it is impossible to regard this list of advantages and disadvantages as exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Each Scheme Creditor is advised to make its own assessment of how the relevant Scheme would affect its interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Each Scheme Company considers that the main advantages referred to above outweigh the possible disadvantages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">
 ATTENDING THE SCHEME MEETINGS 
 
 If you are a Scheme Creditor, you are entitled to attend and vote at the relevant Scheme Meeting convened for 15 August 2006, in respect of each Scheme Company against which a Scheme Liability arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">The Scheme Meetings have been convened as directed by the Court, for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, approving the Scheme in relation to each Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The Scheme Meetings will be held on 15 August 2006, at the offices of the offices of Clayton Utz, Level 34, No 1 O'Connell Street, Sydney, NSW 2000, commencing at 10:00 am (Sydney time), in respect of the NRG London (Australian branch) Scheme and 10:30 am, (Sydney time), in respect of the NRG Victory Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Each Scheme Company is of the view that all Scheme Creditors should vote at any applicable Scheme Meeting, irrespective of whether they have proportional, non-proportional or IBNR Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Each Scheme Company considers that one Scheme Meeting for its Scheme is appropriate given that, under the Scheme, Scheme Creditors do not give up or acquire rights which are so dissimilar as to make it impossible for Scheme Creditors to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Notice of the Scheme Meetings is included in Section 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">It may also be obtained by email, fax or post by issuing a postal service request to a Scheme Company using the contact details given on page 3 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">
 HOW TO ATTEND AND VOTE AT THE SCHEME MEETINGS 
 
 Scheme Creditors may attend the relevant Scheme Meeting in person or by attorney or by proxy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">An individual appointed as corporate representative to attend a Scheme Meeting on behalf of a Scheme Creditor who is a corporation, partnership or other unincorporated body, must bring with him or her to the relevant Scheme Meeting, a form or appointment executed by the corporation either under common seal, or by a director and secretary, by a partner on behalf of the partnership, or by the individual (as the case requires).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Enclosed with this Scheme Booklet is a proxy and voting form, to be used for voting at the Scheme Meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The proxy and voting form can be used for all Claims against all Scheme Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">A copy of the proxy and voting form can be found in Section 8 of the Scheme Booklet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Each Scheme Creditor should indicate on the proxy and voting form how it intends to vote in respect of each Scheme Company against which it maintains a Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">To assist Scheme Creditors, where the relevant Scheme Company has sufficient information to do so, it will pre-complete the proxy and voting form of known Scheme Creditors, indicating its estimate of the value of the Scheme Creditor's Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">No estimate will be included for IBNR, as the Scheme Companies do not provide for IBNR on a Scheme Creditor by Scheme Creditor basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Any details of Claims provided are intended to assist Scheme Creditors in completing their proxy and voting form and should not be regarded as a complete and accurate list of all Claims of a Scheme Creditor that may be affected by the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The Scheme Creditor may accept this statement of Claims and value, or may alter the details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The proxy and voting form must be returned to the Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Scheme Companies, (re)insurance brokers, agents or intermediaries may be able to assist Scheme Creditors in confirming or identifying Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Further copies of the proxy and voting form are available upon request to the relevant Scheme Company (see page 3 above for contact details).</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Whether or not Scheme Creditors intend to be present in person at the relevant Scheme Meeting, they are requested to complete and sign the proxy and voting form in accordance with the instructions printed on the proxy and voting form to the Scheme Company c/o the person and address specified on page 3, above and the Guidance Notes accompanying the proxy and voting form and return the proxy and voting form as soon as possible, and in any event so that they are received by 5:00 pm (Sydney time) on 11 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Appointing a proxy will not prevent a Scheme Creditor from attending and voting in person at the relevant Scheme Meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">However, a proxy will not be able to vote if the relevant Scheme Creditor attends the relevant Scheme Meeting and votes in person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Proxy and voting forms may also be handed in at the registration desk at the relevant Scheme Meeting prior to the commencement of the Scheme Meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Please note that faxed and emailed forms of proxy and voting forms will only be accepted if they are legible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Each Scheme Company would like as many votes as possible to be cast at its Scheme Meeting (whether in person or by proxy).</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Each Scheme Creditor is therefore encouraged to sign and return its proxy and voting form as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">
 VALUE OF CLAIMS FOR VOTING PURPOSES 
 
 The value to be attributed for voting purposes to a Scheme Creditor's Claim will be determined by the Chairperson of the relevant Scheme Meeting based on the Chairperson's estimate of the Scheme Company's net liability to the Scheme Creditor in respect of the Claim after any deduction, set-off or cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The chairperson will be Nancy Milne (see Section 10.9 for further details) and Ian Hutchinson in her absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">In the event that either Nancy Milne or Ian Hutchinson has a conflict of interest in relation to the determination of any issue the subject of the Scheme Meetings, the Scheme Adjudicator will be the chairperson for the purpose of making any decision or determination in relation to which Nancy Milne or Ian Hutchinson has such a conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The Chairperson's determination shall be based on: 
 the information provided by the relevant Scheme Creditor; 
 
 the information available to the relevant Scheme Company from its existing records; and 
 
 advice from the Scheme Actuary (who will be present at the Scheme Meetings) applying the principles described in the Estimation Methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Account will also be taken of any known deduction, set-off or cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">If the sum of the deduction, set-off or cross-claim exceeds the value of the Claim, the value of the Claim for voting purposes will be zero.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">
 
 For the purposes of voting at the Scheme Meetings, Claims will be converted into Australian dollars at the closing mid-market rate of exchange for the relevant currency, quoted on the Reserve Bank of Australia website, 2 Business Days prior to the Scheme Meetings (being 11 August 2006).</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The Chairperson has the power to reject a Claim, in whole or in part, for voting purposes only if the Chairperson considers that it does not represent a reasonable assessment of the sum due from a Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">The decision of the Chairperson as to the value to be placed on a Claim for voting purposes is final (subject to an overriding decision of the Court at the second court hearing).</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Where the Chairperson has amended a Scheme Creditor's assessment of the value of its Claims for voting purposes, the Chairperson will, if possible, notify the relevant Scheme Creditor of such amendment, and the reasons for the amendment before the Scheme Meetings and, in any event, after the Scheme Meeting but before the second court hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">
 CONSEQUENCES OF VOTING AT SCHEME MEETINGS 
 
 The amount of a Claim admitted for voting purposes will not constitute an admission of the existence or amount of any Claim, and will not bind any Scheme Company or Scheme Creditor, unless the Scheme Creditor accepts the value of the Claim set out in the pre-completed proxy and voting form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Scheme Creditors should note that information and estimates provided in relation to the proxy and voting form may not be protected by legal professional privilege and may be required to be disclosed in any relevant future legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Scheme Creditors should consult their own legal advisers as to the consequences of furnishing such particulars in the event that they are, or may become, involved in any litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">
 SUMMARY OF THE OPERATION OF THE SCHEMES ONCE THEY HAVE BECOME EFFECTIVE 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 This Section describes the main provisions of the Schemes once they have become effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">However, this summary should not be relied upon as a substitute for reading the Schemes (set out in Section 6) in their entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
 PROHIBITED ACTS 
 
 The Schemes will prohibit the commencement (or continuation) of any Proceedings by a Scheme Creditor against a Scheme Company, or its Property, in relation to any Scheme Business, unless the Scheme Creditor has first obtained written consent from the relevant Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Each Scheme will also prohibit Scheme Creditors from commencing or continuing any Proceedings or other regulatory process against the relevant Scheme Company or its Property, for the purpose of obtaining payment in whole or in part, either directly or indirectly, of any Claim, arising in relation to the Scheme Business except: 
 in relation to an Final Determined Claim determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant Scheme where the relevant Scheme Company has failed to make payment of that Final Determined Claim to the Scheme Creditor in accordance with the terms of the relevant Scheme; or 
 
 in relation to an act, omission or decision of a person administering the Scheme, in accordance with section 1321(a) of the Corporations Act (see Section 3.20 and 3.21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">
 CONSEQUENCES OF PROHIBITED ACTS 
 
 If a Scheme Creditor does commence or continue Proceedings against a Scheme Company or its Property after the Effective Date and receives money, Property or any other benefit, it will be treated as having received an advance payment on any Final Determined Claim due to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Consequently, any entitlement to payment in respect of a Final Determined Claim under a Scheme will be reduced to an amount determined by the relevant Scheme Company after taking into account, amongst other things, the money, Property or other benefit received by the Scheme Creditor, as well as any costs incurred by the Scheme Company as a result of the Proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">If any such advance payment to a Scheme Creditor exceeds the amount of its Final Determined Claim, the Scheme Creditor will be required to repay the balance immediately to the relevant Scheme Company to the extent permitted by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">These provisions will operate without prejudice to any rights of action the relevant Scheme Company may have against such a Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">
 INTEREST 
 
 Scheme Creditors will be entitled to receive interest as part of their Final Determined Claim where they are entitled to such interest by reason of contract, statute or other relevant law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Such interest will be calculated from the date provided for in the relevant contract, statute or law, to the day prior to the date on which payment is made in respect of such Final Determined Claim, in accordance with the relevant Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Scheme Creditors will also be entitled to receive default interest (calculated in accordance with the Scheme) on Final Determined Claims, where such Final Determined Claim has been finally agreed or otherwise determined, but remains unpaid by the relevant Scheme Company for 90 days or longer from the date of such agreement or determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">No other interest will be payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">
 CURRENCY CONVERSION 
 
 Claims and Agreed Claims (Pre Set-Off) will be denominated in the currency provided by the relevant Reinsurance Contract(s).</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Where the amount to be applied in set-off against the Scheme Creditor's aggregate Agreed Claim (Pre Set-Off) is payable in a different currency to the currency of the Agreed Claim (Pre Set-Off), the amount to be applied in set-off shall be converted to the relevant currency of the Agreed Claim (Pre Set-Off), at the Relevant Rate of Exchange (as defined in the applicable Scheme).</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Final Determined Claims shall be denominated and paid in the predominant currency in which the Claims arise, unless otherwise requested by a Scheme Creditor (however, each Scheme Company has sole discretion whether or not to agree to such request).</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">
 DISTRIBUTION OF CLAIM FORMS 
 
 Once the Schemes become effective, the Scheme Companies will, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, send notice by post to: 
 all persons who, according to a Scheme Company's records, have or may have a Claim under an insurance or reinsurance contract written by or on behalf of the Scheme Company; 
 
 the manager of ANIP, ANIP Pty Ltd, for distribution to such persons as it sees fit; 
 
 all licensed Australian general insurers; and 
 
 all known brokers and agents identified as having placed Scheme Business with a Scheme Company, or known to be acting on behalf of Scheme Creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Brokers and agents are urged to notify all possible Scheme Creditors of the action that they should consider taking with regard to the Scheme and to advise Scheme Creditors to complete and submit their Claim Forms by the Claims Submission Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">
 
 The Scheme Companies will also place advertisements in The Australian, The Australian Financial Review, The National Business Review (NZ), The New Straits Times, Papua New Guinea Post-Courier and other national newspapers distributed in the Pacific Islands (these being the same newspapers and publications in which the Scheme Meetings are being advertised), calling for Scheme Creditors to complete and submit Claim Forms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">To assist Scheme Creditors, where the Scheme Company has sufficient information to do so, it will pre-complete each Claim Form sent to any Scheme Creditor known to it (at the Effective Date) with its estimate of the value of the Scheme Creditor's Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Scheme Creditors will not be required to submit a Claim Form or provide any supporting information if they agree with the pre-completed amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">No amount will be pre-completed in respect of IBNR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Scheme Creditors will be required to complete or correct their Claim Form, making such amendments or additions to the details as may be necessary, and to submit the Claim Form to the relevant Scheme Company, together with any appropriate supporting information (as described in the Guidance Notes to the Claim Form and in the Estimation Methodology).</sentence>

<sentence id="s535">It was initially called The Victory Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd but changed its name to NRG Victory Australia Limited on 11 December 1991.</sentence>

<sentence id="s538">NRG Victory was originally located in Melbourne, Victoria, but transferred its head office to Sydney in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">
 Operations NRG Victory
 
 The reinsurance business written by NRG Victory falls primarily into the following categories: 
 proportional treaties; 
 
 excess of loss treaties; and 
 
 facultative arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">
 
 The NRG Victory Scheme relates to all non-life insurance business written by NRG Victory since its incorporation in 1956, anywhere in the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The Scheme does not relate to any reinsurance contracts which were transferred by way of a scheme in accordance with Division 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1945 to Life Reinsurance of Australasia Ltd (now Hannover Life Re of Australasia Ltd) in 1993, in accordance with the provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1945.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">Upon transfer, these reinsurance contracts effectively ceased to be a Liability of NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">NRG Victory wrote both life insurance and reinsurance and non-life reinsurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Between 1970 and 1974, NRG Victory accepted non-life risk in South East Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">This business was discontinued in 1974 with the underwriting being assumed by a related company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">In 1986, NRG Victory established a branch in New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">This branch was closed in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">In 1993, the underwriting activities of NRG Victory were affected by the cessation of underwriting activities at a NRG group level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Initially, it was expected that NRG Victory could be sold as a composite company, writing both life and non-life business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">However, attempts to sell NRG Victory were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">As a result, in late 1993, the life business was transferred by way of scheme prepared in accordance with Division 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1945, into a new company, and NRG Victory's non-life portfolio was put in run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">In 1994, the new life subsidiary was sold to the Hannover R&uuml;ckversicherung AG (50%) and E&amp;S R&uuml;ckversicherung (50%) and the administration of NRG Victory, which was now a pure non-life reinsurer, was transferred to Littlewood Services Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">NRG Victory also participated as a member of ANIP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">The pool manager, ANIP Pty Ltd, has provided a list of the policyholders with outstanding claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">NRG Victory's share of those Claims as at 30 June, 2005, amounted to nil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The contractual relationship between the underwriting agent (or pool manager) and the pool members in such a situation is that of principal and agent: the underwriting agent accepts business on behalf of each of the pool members individually, so that each member is bound only to the extent of the line written on his behalf, pursuant to terms of the agency or pool agreement.</sentence>

 ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 This Section has been prepared by Scott Collings, the Scheme Actuary for the proposed Schemes of Arrangement for NRG London (Australian branch) and NRG Victory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Scott Collings is also the approved actuary of the Scheme Companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">This Estimation Methodology applies equally to both Schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">The purpose of the Section is to explain to the Scheme Creditors of each Scheme, the basis on which Claims under each Scheme should be presented, and how Claims will be assessed and determined by the Scheme Actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">The Estimation Methodology provides guidance on the method in which Claims should be presented by Scheme Creditors, and in particular, the supporting information that should be provided with the Claim Form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">The speedy and equitable resolution of Claims will be assisted if Claims are presented in this way and if the assumptions used are considered by the Scheme Actuary to be on a Best Estimate basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">
 TYPES OF CLAIM 
 
 The Estimation Methodology, and the requested supporting information, varies according to the type of Claim as follows:
 &#8226; Property damage Claims --- see Section 5.4 ;
 &#8226; Liability Claims from specific incident (eg a motor accident) --- see Section 5.5 ;
 &#8226; Liability Claims from latent injury (eg asbestos related disease) --- see Section 5.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">The three methodologies are applicable whether the Claim is under a proportional treaty, excess of loss treaty or facultative arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">If a Scheme Creditor believes it has a Claim under the Scheme that is not covered by one of these categories, the relevant Scheme Company should be approached to seek further advice from the Scheme Actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">
 JURISDICTION OF EXPOSURE 
 
 The Schemes apply to all Reinsurance Contracts issued by the Scheme Companies (other than Excluded Liabilities).</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">The vast bulk of the Scheme Creditors are located in Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">The Estimation Methodology therefore applies to Claims arising from Reinsurance Contracts in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">If a Scheme Creditor believes there is a Claim under the Scheme arising in a different jurisdiction (especially relating to inwards reinsurance from the London Market or the United States), the Scheme Company should be approached to seek further advice from the Scheme Actuary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The Estimation Methodology has been prepared so as to set out the type of information and the approach the Scheme Company and the Scheme Actuary would expect Scheme Creditors to follow in calculating and justifying Claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">It does not, however, preclude Scheme Creditors from using other projection techniques, so long as these techniques are shown to be robust and they use assumptions that can be reasonably justified by the Scheme Creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">It similarly does not preclude the Scheme Actuary from using an alternative estimation methodology, should individual claim circumstances warrant such an approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">
 PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS 
 
 Methodology 
 Claims for Property damage may arise under a range of Reinsurance Contracts (including property per risk, property catastrophe, property proportional or liability treaties (in the case of liability treaties indexation would not apply).</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Property damage Claims will be settled on the following basis: 
 the Best Estimate of the outstanding cost of the underlying claim (ground-up loss), taking account of disputes over Liability; 
 
 no allowance should be made for future Claim inflation and no discounting for the time value of money; 
 
 the Best Estimate of the ground up loss should be applied to the reinsurance program in order to estimate the Scheme Company's share after allowance for the Scheme Company's participation in the treaty; and 
 
 the Best Estimate of the ground up loss should be provided by the Scheme Creditor in sufficient detail to enable the Scheme Company to calculate reinstatement premiums where appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Any Claim against the Scheme will be offset against any reinstatement premiums payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">
 
 Supporting Information 
 It will not usually be necessary to provide additional supporting information of an actuarial nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">However the following information should be provided: 
 policy details as required by the Claim Form; 
 
 loss adjusters and/or lawyers' reports in respect of disputed underlying claims; 
 
 the amount being claimed under the Scheme by the Scheme Creditor from the Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">
 CLAIMS FOR SPECIFIC INCIDENT 
 
 This sub-section applies to Claims for personal injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Most such Claims arise under excess of loss treaty reinsurance arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">It applies only to Claims where the incident giving rise to the Claim is a single incident occurring at a specific time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Latent injury claims are dealt with in section 5.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">Methodology 
 Claims will be settled on a Best Estimate basis as follows: 
 known Claims: the value of known Claims should be assessed individually based on the circumstances of the Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The ground-up Claim amount should be assessed as the Best Estimate value of the amount required to settle the Claim at the likely date of settlement; 
 
 IBNR Claims: in general, no payment will be made for IBNR Claims unless the Scheme Creditor can demonstrate a pattern of claim incidence that gives rise to a reasonable likelihood of IBNR Claims arising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">If a Claim is to be submitted for IBNR Claims, then triangles should be provided of both ground-up and excess-of-loss Claim emergence (numbers and incurred amounts) along with the actuarial basis of IBNR estimation; 
 
 inflation: if inflation is allowed for in the Best Estimate then the rate of inflation should be 4% pa unless the Scheme Creditor can justify a different rate applicable to the nature of the Claim; 
 
 indexation: the supporting information should indicate whether the Reinsurance Contract is subject to indexation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">If so, the basis of indexation should be specified and the original and current values of the index number provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Future indexation of the treaty should be allowed for until the anticipated date of settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Future indexation should be at a rate appropriate to the basis of the index; 
 
 discounting: determination of the amount of the Claim should take into account the normal negotiated process of discounting the value of future expenses to be incurred by the claimant (such as future care costs) in recognition of the fact that the underlying claim is to be settled by way of immediate lump sum as opposed to by way of an ongoing stream of expense reimbursement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">The Scheme Company will pay the amount of the Claim so agreed at face value provided the Scheme Creditor expects to settle the underlying claim prior to 30 June 2011.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Where the settlement date of the underlying claim is expected to be some time after 30 June 2011, the Claim will be reduced by 5.5% per annum for the period between 30 June 2011 and the expected settlement date; 
 
 reinstatement: any reinstatement premium payable will be calculated on a basis consistent with the Claim amount and offset in the settlement calculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">
 
 Supporting information 
 
In addition to the information requested on the Claim Form, supporting information should include:
 expert advice on Liability and quantum; 
 
 copy of the indexation agreement and index numbers; 
 
 explanation as to how and why the Best Estimate of the Claim amount differs from the most recent prior reserve advice to the Scheme Company; 
 
 if an IBNR Claim is being made then the Scheme Creditor should provide supporting analysis of the historical development of paid and incurred losses to the policies by underwriting and development year as well as the method and assumptions used to estimate the total Claim amount; and 
 
 the amount being claimed under the Scheme by the Scheme Creditor from the Scheme Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">
 CLAIMS FOR LATENT INJURY 
 
 This sub-section applies to Claims arising from latent injuries such as asbestos related diseases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">For convenience the Estimation Methodology is described in terms of asbestos related diseases, but if another injury type is applicable, the Estimation Methodology applies with the necessary changes in terminology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">

 Methodology 
 
 Latent injury Claims will be settled on the basis of the Best Estimate of the discounted present value of known and future Claims as follows: 
 structure: the estimation should be derived from the best available projection of the underlying disease or injury process, before the application of insurance and reinsurance terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The underlying projections should relate to both the number of persons injured and the average cost of Claims (if possible ground-up) plus costs; 
 
 inflation: the underlying average cost of Claims should be projected from current expected levels using inflation of 6% pa (representing 4% wage inflation and 2% superimposed inflation) unless the Scheme Creditor has adequate justification for a different rate of Claim inflation; 
 
 Liability for Claims: the estimation method should allow for the likely sharing among defendants and insurers, the likely spread of costs over years of exposure and apportionment of reinsurance deductibles and limits according to an established methodology; 
 
 indexation: indexation of reinsurance arrangements should be allowed for, both from commencement to calculation date and from calculation date to expected Claim settlement date; 
 
 discounting: determination of the amount of the Claim should take into account the normal negotiated process of discounting the value of future expenses to be incurred by the claimant (such as future care costs) in recognition of the fact that the underlying claim is to be settled by way of immediate lump sum as opposed to by way of an ongoing stream of expense reimbursement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">The Scheme Company will pay the amount of the Claim so agreed at face value provided the Scheme Creditor expects to settle the underlying claim prior to 30 June 2011.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Where the settlement date of the underlying claim is expected to be some time after 30 June 2011, the Claim will be reduced by 5.5% per annum for the period between 30 June 2011 and the expected settlement date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">To allow reasonable equity with the Claims described in Section 5.5 and to reduce complexity, the settlement date can be approximated by the Claim reporting date in the calculations.</sentence>
