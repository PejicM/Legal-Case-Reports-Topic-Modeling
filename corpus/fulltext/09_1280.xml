<sentence id="s0">
 The applicants are sisters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They are Indian citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They have disclosed that they were previously members of an organisation known as the "Exclusive Brethren", having ceased their involvement with the organisation in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Since then, they have been involved in establishing what they describe as "a pioneering, record-breaking education research organisation" called the "BOSS School" in Mumbai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They claim that, over the past three or four years, they have come into conflict with the Exclusive Brethren and that members of that organisation have committed a range of criminal offences against them and their colleagues at the BOSS School.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Their claims were reported to the Australian Federal Police ('the AFP").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Federal agents considered the claims but declined to take action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicants then had resort to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This proceeding was commenced by an application filed on 31 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In that application, two of the applicants (the third was later joined) sought the issuing of mandatory orders against the AFP, the Commonwealth Government and the Immigration Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondents have moved the Court for orders under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA Act") that the proceeding be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondents filed written submissions in support of their application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The applicants filed detailed written submissions in opposition to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The hearing of the respondents' application was fixed for 5 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">When the matter was called on there was no appearance by any of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Evidence presented by the respondents indicates that Ms Priscilla D'Souza departed Australia on 3 March 2009, and that her two sisters had departed Australia on the morning of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">No forewarning of their departure had been given to the respondents or to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">None of them is the holder of a visa which would entitle her to return to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It cannot, therefore, be predicted when, if ever, they may again be present in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In these circumstances, I determined that the hearing should continue and that I would take into account the written submissions filed on both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The application sought: The respondents contend that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of obtaining any of the relief sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Section 31A of the FCA Act relevantly provides: 
 
 "(1) ... 
 

 
 
 (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: 
 

 
 
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and 
 

 
 
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 

 
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be:
 
 (a) hopeless; or
 (b) bound to fail; 
 

 
 
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 

 
 
 (4) This section does not limit any powers that the Court has apart from this section".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 In Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 , Gordon J noted (at 406) that, 31A was introduced in order to extend "the power of the court to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases".</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The section empowers the Court to give summary judgment in favour of a respondent if it is satisfied that the applicant "has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">This will be the case even if the application cannot be characterised as either hopeless or bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Plainly, s 31A was, as Lindgren J held in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at 310, designed "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment" from the level that had been fixed by the High Court in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-2 and General Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways (N.S.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Although the standard which must be met by a respondent who seeks summary judgment under the FCA Act has been expressed in a variety of different ways, where, as here, an application is made under s 31A, the Court is required to give close attention to the statutory language and to apply that test to the exclusion of all others: see PZ Cussons (International) Ltd v Rosa Dora Imports Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1642 ; (2007) 74 IPR 372 at 375 (per Kenny J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The applicants have filed extensive affidavit evidence in support of their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Much of this material would, had it been objected to, have been ruled to be inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It is not, however, necessary for the purposes of the present application, to rule on the admissibility of any of the evidence on which the applicants sought to rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">This is because the respondents advanced their summary judgment application on the grounds that the Court lacks the jurisdiction to grant some of the relief sought and that, where it has jurisdiction, the relief sought is not, for legal reasons, able to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">MANDAMUS DIRECTED TO THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE 
 The first remedy which the applicants seek is the issue of a writ of mandamus requiring the AFP to commence criminal proceedings for a range of offences against seven persons who are alleged to be members of the Exclusive Brethren.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Court has jurisdiction, under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ("the Judiciary Act "), to deal with a proceeding in which the writ of mandamus is sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The writ is available to compel a public official to perform an act "which the applicant is entitled to have done, and without the doing of which he cannot enforce or enjoy some right which he possesses": R v Arndel [1906] HCA 7 ; (1906) 3 CLR 557 at 566-7 (per Griffith CJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Put more simply, the writ of mandamus requires a public official to perform a public duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The applicants can succeed against the AFP only if the AFP has a duty to commence criminal proceedings against the named individuals for the offences which are nominated in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I put to one side issues such as whether the AFP, as distinct from individual police officers, can be said to have a duty to initiate prosecutions and whether the powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions might impinge on any common law power a police officer might have had to initiate criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I also put to one side the question of the standing of the applicants to apply for an order that the AFP commence criminal proceedings against persons who are not alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct against any of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There is a further question, to which I will return, about the effect of the exercise of ministerial discretion in the decision-making processes which must precede the laying of charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The AFP is established under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) ("the AFP Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Members of the AFP are subject to the administrative direction and control of the AFP Commissioner: see s 37(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The functions of the AFP include the provision of police services in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth: see s 8(1)(b)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Members of the AFP have the same powers and duties as are conferred on a police constable in the place in which the member is acting: see s 9(1)(c)(i) and (v).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The result of this legislative scheme is that AFP officers have the same powers and duties (in relation to the enforcement of Commonwealth laws) as a police constable in the State in which the AFP officer is working would have with respect to State law enforcement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In this way the powers and duties imposed by common law on constables are, subject to any statutory exception, conferred and imposed on AFP officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The presently relevant question is whether any AFP officer is under a common law duty to charge the named individuals with the offences identified by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The answer to this question must be "no".</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Sometimes, persons are dissatisfied by the response which they receive when they complain to the police about what they see as criminal conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Occasionally these disgruntled citizens have sought the issue of writs of mandamus to police officers requiring that the officers investigate allegations, make arrests or commence prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Courts have consistently held that the writ will only be granted in exceptional cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This is because policing powers carry with them a wide measure of discretion such that it usually cannot be asserted, as a matter of law, that a police officer is under any unqualified duty to exercise particular powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In R v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis; Ex parte Blackburn [1968] 2 QB 118 at 136, Lord Denning MR said that: 
 
 "Although the chief officers of police are answerable to the law, there are many fields in which they have a discretion with which the law will not interfere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">For instance, it is for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, or the chief constable, as the case may be, to decide in any particular case whether inquiries should be pursued, or whether an arrest should be made, or a prosecution brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It must be for him to decide on the disposition of his force and the concentration of his resources on any particular crime or area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">No court can or should give him direction on such a matter .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He can also make policy decisions and give effect to them, as, for instance, was often done when prosecutions were not brought for attempted suicide" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The width of the discretionary powers vested in police officers was emphasised by Madgwick J in O'Malley v Keelty [2005] FCA 861 ; (2005) 148 FCR 170.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">His Honour said (at 179-180) that: 
 
 "Organising and assigning priorities in a modern police force are patently complex, difficult, and likely politically controversial matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Courts should exercise very considerable restraint before intervening in such an area ... 
 

 
 
 [A] court cannot and should not compel a police force to investigate every breach of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">There are many mysteries in this world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Some of them involve possible commissions of crime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is not, however, the responsibility of police officers to investigate all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Indeed, the role of the police is not to investigate whether, at large, there has been a breach of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Rather, their duty is to investigate whether there has been a breach of the law for which an identifiable person might be convicted if prosecuted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The requirements of the AFP Case Categorisation and Prioritisation Model are consistent with this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I adhere to what I said in Scott (at [69]): 
 

 
 
 except in the context of a coronial inquiry, one must allow that, if there appears to be no serious prospect of obtaining a conviction, it may be a quite reasonable decision, even in a very serious case, by the relevant police officer(s) not to expend resources or further resources on an investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Among other matters militating against the prospect of obtaining a conviction will often be the lapse of time since the alleged offence" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 

 In Hinchcliffe v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2001] FCA 1747 ; (2001) 118 FCR 308 , the applicants had complained to the AFP that third parties had contravened certain legislative provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">AFP officers examined the circumstances and sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">On being advised that the material disclosed no offence, the AFP advised the applicants that it would take no further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The applicants applied for writs of mandamus to require the AFP to investigate their complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The application was summarily dismissed by Kenny J on the ground that it was bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">This was because the AFP was not under any relevant duty and, in any event, no tenable basis had been shown for the allegation that the AFP officers were in breach of any duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Her Honour quoted with approval the observations of Lord Denning MR in Blackburn .</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She held (at 320) that: 
 
 "I accept that, where a member of the AFP receives a complaint from a member of the public, the member discharges his or her duty to enforce the law, if: 
 

 
 
 (1) he or she gives due and proper consideration to the question whether and in what way an initial inquiry into the complaint should be made; and 
 

 
 
 (2) he or she acts appropriately upon the view which he or she has formed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 
 If the police officer acts consistently with these requirements and declines to investigate a complaint, it follows, as her Honour held, that no duty is imposed on the officer to consider instigating a prosecution against any alleged miscreant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">When the applicants attended to make their complaint to the AFP they were received by Federal agents Mr Nicolas Read and Mr Wade Howell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The group met for approximately half an hour during which time the applicants made various allegations of conduct that they alleged constituted criminal offences under Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">On the following day two Federal agents were assigned by Mr Read to consider the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The speed with which the allegations were examined was unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Federal agent Read considered that the assessment of the allegations should be accorded a high priority because of the seriousness of the offences which had, allegedly, been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">After a detailed consideration by his officers, Federal agent Read concluded that the allegations and materials provided by the applicants did not disclose any Commonwealth offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In those circumstances he determined that no further action should be taken and the applicants were so advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicants, however, seek to turn the expedition with which the matters raised by them were considered to their advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">They submit, without evidence, that the allegations could not properly have been considered in a little over a day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It is to be remembered that all that was considered during that time by the two officers was whether it appeared that offences might have been committed against Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">This judgment fell to be made on the basis of the information supplied by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">There is no reason to doubt that the officers gave proper consideration to the question of whether an initial inquiry should be instituted into the complaints made by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">A bone fide view was formed that no further action should be taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In these circumstances no further duty, enforceable by a writ of mandamus, arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There is another obstacle in the path of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The offences of genocide and crimes against humanity are provided for in Division 268 of Chapter 8 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Code").</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Section 268.121 of the Code provides that proceedings for an offence under Division 268 must not be commenced without the written consent of the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Thus, even if the AFP, on completion of a full investigation, decided that there was evidence that one or both of these offences had been committed, it could not institute criminal proceedings against anybody in the absence of the Attorney-General's consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">A writ of mandamus could not compel the AFP to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The applicants draw attention to the provisions of s 268.121(3) which permit a person to be arrested and charged with an offence under the Division before the necessary consent has been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The applicants contend that AFP officers could be ordered by the Court to arrest and charge the alleged offenders without waiting for the Attorney-General's written consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">That is a doubtful proposition but one which need not be further considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">On the material before them, the Federal agents were in no position to arrest or charge anybody and could not be compelled to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In any event an arrest or the act of laying charges is not the same thing as commencing criminal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In the context of s 268.121, a distinction is drawn between arrest and charging on the one hand and the commencement of criminal proceedings on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The latter step involves the initiation of the curial processes which lead to a trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It can be taken only with the consent of the Attorney-General.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The application seeks the issue of a writ of mandamus requiring the AFP to begin such proceedings, not requiring the charging or the arrest of alleged offenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In the absence of a relevant duty, a writ of mandamus could not be issued against the AFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">This part of the application is bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">ORDERS AGAINST THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT 
 The applicants have sought to have the Court make orders directing the Commonwealth government to apply diplomatic pressure to India to stop what they describe as "the genocide" of BOSS members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">This pressure would be brought to bear through international institutions such as the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations, and by urging other governments to apply pressure on India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Court cannot, at the urging of an applicant, order the Commonwealth government or any officer of the government to take any step unless the Court is empowered to make a particular order and the preconditions for the making of the order have been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It must, therefore, be assumed that when the applicants refer to the making of "orders" against the Commonwealth government they are referring to orders of mandamus which the Court has power to grant under s 39B of the Judiciary Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Under s 39B(1) the Court has jurisdiction "with respect to any matter in which a writ of mandamus ... is sought against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth" (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The respondents contend, correctly, in my view, that the Court may not direct the Commonwealth government to act in the way sought by the applicants because the issues involved are not justiciable and, as a result, are not "matters" in the necessary sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347 at 370, Gummow J said that: 
 
 "... there will be no "matter" if the plaintiff seeks an extension of the court's true function into a domain that does not belong to it, namely the consideration of undertakings and obligations depending entirely on political sanctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Such non-justiciable issues include agreements and understandings ... between the Australian and foreign governments... Those issues do not give rise to "matters" in the sense necessary for the exercise of federal jurisdiction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

This passage was referred to with approval by Black CJ and Hill J in Petrotimor Companhia de Petroleos SARL v Commonwealth [2003] FCAFC 3 ; (2003) 126 FCR 354 at 373.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Issues which are not justiciable and fall outside the proper domain of federal courts include "issues arising out of international relations": see Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment v Peko-Wallsend Ltd (1987) 15 FCR 274 at 307 (per Wilcox J, with whom Bowen CJ agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In Thorpe v Commonwealth of Australia (No 3) [1997] HCA 21 ; (1997) 144 ALR 677 , the plaintiff commenced a proceeding in the High Court seeking declarations that the Commonwealth owed certain obligations to Aboriginal people, that it ought to move the United Nations General Assembly for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice as to the legal rights of Aboriginal people and that the government should negotiate with him about the terms of the foreshadowed resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Kirby J set aside the plaintiff's written statement of claim for want of jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In dealing with the declaration which related to the securing of a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Kirby J said (at 690) that what the plaintiff was: 
 
 "... seeking ... is that this court should set out to control the way in which the Commonwealth conducts Australia's international relations ... [I]n no case that could be cited, nor any that I have discovered in my own researches, has this court purported to intrude in such a way in the conduct of Australia's international activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The reason why no such case could be found is plain enough although the explanation may be advanced in various ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It might be said that the subject matters of the declarations are not the kind of "immediate right, duty or liability" grounded in a legal norm which would present a "matter" to enliven the jurisdiction of this court under the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">This was the Commonwealth's primary argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">But it might also be said that the issues presented by the declarations lacked "judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving" a justiciable issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Traditionally in this country, as under like constitutional provisions in the United States, the courts have been extremely reluctant to pass upon the conduct of international relations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 
 Later in his reasons, his Honour said (at 692) that if a plaintiff invites a federal court to perform functions other than those properly exercisable by the judicial branch of government: 
 
 "... it matters little in practical terms whether the court, facing an objection, rules that it lacks jurisdiction for want of a "matter" engaging its powers, or that it says that any such "matter" would be non-justiciable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In either event, the court's duty is plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It should stop the proceedings forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It will thereby send the parties to the other branches of government, or to other public fora, in which they can make their complaint".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 
 The applicants, in the present case, invite the Court to direct the Commonwealth government to adopt and prosecute a particular policy which is designed to influence the conduct of another sovereign government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">They wish the Commonwealth to engage other sovereign governments and international institutions in an attempt to have the Indian government act in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The conduct of Australia's international relations falls within the province of the executive government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In the absence of legislative restraint it is a matter for the government to determine the issues which it chooses to raise with foreign governments and the manner in which it will pursue those issues with foreign governments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The choices which the government makes in dealing with international relations are a matter for it and are not justiciable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">They do not give rise to "matters" with which the judicial branch may deal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In my view, the Court thus lacks jurisdiction to entertain this part of the applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">MANDAMUS DIRECTED TO THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT 
 The applicants applied for protection visas under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">A delegate of the Minister rejected their applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">They appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">In this proceeding they apply for a writ of mandamus to direct the Immigration Department to grant the visas which the Minister's delegate has already refused to grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Under the Migration Act , visas are granted by the Minister or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Immigration Department has no power to grant visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Department has no duty enforceable by a writ of mandamus or otherwise to issue protection visas to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">For that reason alone the application is bound to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The application would also have failed had it been directed to the Minister or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">This is because the application would necessarily involve the Court directing the Minister or a delegate how to exercise power conferred on them under the Migration Act , and to do so in a way in which they, having considered the applicants' applications, have determined not to be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">This would be tantamount to judicial review of the decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The applicants invoke the original jurisdiction of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">That jurisdiction is circumscribed by s 476A of the Migration Act , in respect of decisions (including decisions to grant or refuse visas) made under that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Court does not have original jurisdiction in relation to decisions made regarding applications for protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As a result, the Court cannot accede to the applicants' application insofar as it relates to the grant of protection visas to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">DISPOSITION 
 The application should be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Judgment should be entered for the respondents against each of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The applicants should pay the respondents' costs of the proceeding, including the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">NOTICES OF MOTION 
 While the proceeding has been pending in the Court, the applicants have filed a number of notices of motion which have not yet been heard and determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">These notices of motion have been brought in the proceeding but have sought relief which extends far beyond that sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">These notices of motion have, for example, sought the issue of the writ of mandamus to the Commonwealth to require it to issue provisional arrest warrants for the arrest of a number of Indian judges, and to compel the Commonwealth to petition the United Nations Security Council to take certain action in India in relation to the BOSS school and those associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Had these notices of motion sought to amend the application so as to include claims for relief of this kind, the applications would, inevitably, have been refused for the same reasons which have led to the respondents succeeding in obtaining judgment pursuant to s 31A of the FCA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In the event, as the application has been struck out, there is no proceeding within which the motions may any longer be pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
