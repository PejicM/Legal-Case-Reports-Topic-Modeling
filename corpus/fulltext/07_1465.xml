 Introduction 
 
1 Mr Rivera is presently incarcerated pursuant to the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act') at Parklea Correctional Centre ('Parklea').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr Rivera has been in custody since 19 September 2002, pending an extradition request by the United States of America ('the USA').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 4 September 2002, a NSW magistrate issued a provisional arrest warrant under s 12 of the Act for Mr Rivera's arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 12 November 2002, the USA presented a request to Australia for Mr Rivera's extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 16 December 2002 Magistrate O'Shane ('the Magistrate') determined under s 19 of the Act that Mr Rivera was eligible to be surrendered to the USA in relation to the extradition offence of murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Section 19(9) of the Act provides that where a magistrate determines that the person is eligible for surrender to the extradition country in relation to the extradition offence, the magistrate shall, relevantly, by warrant order that ' the person be committed to prison to await surrender '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On the same day, the Magistrate issued a warrant under s 19(9) of the Act ('the commitment warrant') committing Mr Rivera to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre ('the Remand Centre') to await surrender, or release under s 22(5) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr Rivera sought, unsuccessfully, to review the Magistrate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 In August 2006, the Minister for Justice and Customs determined under s 22 of the Act that Mr Rivera be surrendered to the USA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A challenge by Mr Rivera to that decision was dismissed by a Judge of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An appeal to the Full Court was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Rivera has filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the Full Court decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 Mr Rivera was moved from the Remand Centre to Parklea in June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 Mr Rivera seeks a writ of Habeas Corpus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He seeks a declaration that his detention at Parklea is unlawful within the meaning of s 53 of the Act, damages for unlawful imprisonment while in custody at Parklea and an order that he be transferred from Parklea back to the Remand Centre or, alternatively, to Villawood Detention Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He also seeks an injunction restraining the respondents from removing him from custody at the Remand Centre if he is transferred there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 Mr Rivera seeks pro bono assistance under Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 Each of the respondents moves for dismissal of the proceedings under Order 20 Rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The respondents do not challenge the jurisdiction of the Court, which is conferred by s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 Mr Rivera, in bringing these proceedings, asserts that the Commonwealth has ' overall responsibility ' for the determination of his extradition case and that the State acts as its agent in facilitating his detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That is not disputed by the respondents for the purposes of these applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He has commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and in the Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission ('HREOC') in connection with conditions of his custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He makes a number of allegations in his affidavit filed in these proceedings giving details of various matters, such as the lower standard of access to legal materials in Parklea than that made available at the Remand Centre and inability to gain access to all of his personal belongings on transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">9 Mr Rivera asserts that being held in a "correctional" centre rather than a "remand" centre where prisoners are unconvicted is inconsistent with article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ('the Covenant') which, he says, provides that unconvicted prisoners will be separated from convicted prisoners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is also, he submits, contrary to s 53 of the Act for him to be placed in a correctional centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">10 He also asserts in his affidavit, without any supporting factual material, that the transfer is an abuse of process designed to disrupt his various legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Rivera remained at the Remand Centre until June 2007, despite 5 years of constant legal proceedings commenced by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">This assertion is made without a foundation and I see no basis for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 Mr Rivera does not seek to be released from custody but wishes to be transferred back to the Remand Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Habeas corpus 
 
12 The Commonwealth and the State note that there is no challenge to the legality of the warrant and contend that an order in the nature of habeas corpus will only issue if the detention is shown to be unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">That is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">There is no arguable case that Mr Rivera's incarceration is unlawful and Mr Rivera does not suggest that it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">His challenge to the Magistrate's decision has been exhausted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">13 Habeas corpus is not available to remedy perceived inadequacies in the conditions of custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Habeas corpus is not available to impeach collaterally the correctness of a judgment or order made by a court of competent jurisdiction which is not shown to be a nullity (Re Officer in Charge of Cells, ACT Supreme Court; ex parte Eastman [1994] HCA 36 ; (1994) 123 ALR 478 at 480 per Deane J; Re Stanbridge's Application (1996) 70 ALJR 640 at 642-3 per Kirby J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">14 There is no arguable case for a writ of habeas corpus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The holding of Mr Rivera under a regime of correction 
 The Act 
 
15 Section 53 of the Act provides:
 
 The laws of a State or Territory with respect to: 
 
 
 
 (a) the conditions of imprisonment of persons imprisoned in that State or Territory to await trial for offences against the law of that State or Territory; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the treatment of such persons during imprisonment; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the transfer of such persons from prison to prison; 
 
 
 
 
 apply, so far as they are capable of application, in relation to persons who have been committed to prison in that State or Territory under this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 

16 Section 53 makes specific provision for the transfer of persons from prison to prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">17 Mr Rivera has not been able to point to a deficiency in the statutory authority to imprison him at Parklea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As s 53 provides, it is the laws of NSW with respect to the conditions of imprisonment of persons on remand awaiting trial which regulate Mr Rivera's imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Section 53 and s 19(9) of the Act, under which the commitment warrant was issued, refer to "prison".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Prison is defined in s 5 of the Act to ' include a gaol, lock-up or other place of detention '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">18 In Cabal v Secretary, Department of Justice (Victoria) (2000) 177 ALR 306 Gray J considered a claim similar to Mr Rivera's concerning treatment and the asserted right by persons awaiting extradition not to be held in the same manner as convicted persons (at [14]---[15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">There it was argued that the Act does not permit a person to be held under a regime of correction but only under a regime of detention and that the term "prison" should be read this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The submission was that the prison in which the applicants were held, a correctional prison, was not a prison within the meaning of the Act (at [16]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There, too, the applicants sought habeas corpus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">19 As noted by Gray J in Cabal (at [21]), "prison" is a term of broad definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as meaning ' a public building for the confinement or safe custody of criminals and others committed by law ' or ' a place of confinement or involuntary restraint '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The common law has accorded the term similar breadth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It encompasses both confinement and custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Justice Gray concluded that Parliament intended, by s 53, to give the term "the broadest meaning".</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">His Honour concluded that ' the intention of s 53 of the Act is to ensure that, so far as practicable, those detained under the Extradition Act will not be treated as convicted criminals, but will be treated according to whatever regime exists in the particular state or territory for persons held in prison awaiting trial ' (at [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In Victoria, there was no distinction between convicted and unconvicted prisoners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Where that was the case, the way in which a person was held under s 53 was not inconsistent with the terms of the Act (at [22]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">His Honour concluded (at [23]) that even though Parliament sought to achieve the object of treating persons awaiting extradition as humanely as possible, there was no occasion for reading down the definition of "prison" to promote that underlying object or purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">20 In Cabal , Gray J concluded (at [33]) that there was no valid argument available to reduce the meaning of the term "prison" in s 19(9) of the Act so as to render it inapplicable to different classes of prison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Similarly, I am of the view that no arguable case for any breach of the Act on this basis has been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The term "prison" applies to the Remand Centre and to Parklea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The NSW Act 
 
21 The relevant NSW Act with respect to the administration of sentences is the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) ('the Administration Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There is nothing in the Administration Act or the Act which imposes any obligation on the NSW correctional authorities or the Commonwealth to accord to Mr Rivera segregation from convicted persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">22 The Remand Centre is a maximum security correctional facility, one of three correctional facilities which make up the Silverwater Correctional Complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It operates for prisoners on remand, or awaiting transfer, or attending Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Most inmates leave the Remand Centre within the first few months of arrival.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">This is either because they obtain bail and are released or they are classified and transferred to the centre of classification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Parklea is a correctional centre that houses remand and sentenced maximum and minimum-security prisoners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Each of Parklea and the Remand Centre has, since 2001, been declared a correctional centre pursuant to ss 225 and 226 of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">That is, they have the same prison classification under the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">23 Section 3 of the Administration Act defines "inmate" as a person to whom Part 2 of that Act applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Part 2 applies, as provided, in s 4(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Relevantly, as Mr Rivera does not come within the description of s 4(1)(a) --- (d); Part 2 applies, under ss (e) and (f) to:
 
 
 (e) any person the subject of a warrant or order by which a court or other competent authority has committed the person to a correctional centre otherwise than as referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d), and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) any person in custody who is given into the keeping of a correctional officer under section 250.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 

24 Section 23 of the Administration Act provides for transfers from one correctional centre to another, inter alia in s 23(1)(f): ' because of any other reason specified in the order '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It is not suggested s 23 does not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">While, in practice, Parklea and the Remand Centre house different categories of prisoners, there is no breach of the Administration Act or the Act by moving Mr Rivera from one correctional centre to the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
 
25 Article 10 of the Covenant provides relevantly:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">(a) Accused persons shall, save in exceptional circumstances, be 
 
 
 
 
 segregated from convicted persons and shall be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) Accused juvenile persons shall be separated from adults and brought as speedily as possible for adjudication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 
 
 

26 In Cabal (at [26]) Gray J noted that Australia is a signatory to the Covenant and has ratified it, subject to certain conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">One of those reservations is in Article 10 which provides:
 
 ...in relation to paragraph 2(a) the principle of segregation is accepted as an objective to achieved progressively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 

27 That reservation was in effect at the time of the decision in Cabal .</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There is no suggestion that it has been withdrawn and the parties accept that the reservation is still in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">After considering the Covenant and Australia's obligations in the light of the reservation and the Act in some detail, Gray J concluded (at [28]) that the Act has a clear meaning which cannot be changed simply because one State has changed the manner in which it deals with prisoners awaiting trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">His Honour also held that, even if the actions of one state were such as to place Australia in breach of its international obligations, that would not change the meaning of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Neither the Act nor the Administration Act impose any obligation on the NSW correctional authorities to accord Mr Rivera, or any other prisoner, segregation from convicted persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Even if Mr Rivera's imprisonment at Parklea were a contravention of Australia's obligations under the Covenant, it would be of no assistance to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The terms of the Covenant form no part of the law of Australia ( Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 per Mason CJ and McHugh J at 305; per Brennan J at 321; per Dawson J at 348; per Toohey J at 359-360).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">28 Justice Gray also considered whether the Act must be construed in accordance with the Covenant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He concluded that there was no valid argument available to the applicants in that case, who were legally represented, to reduce the meaning of the term "prison" in s 19(9) of the Act so as to render it inapplicable to prisons for correctional purposes in circumstances where the applicants were imprisoned in the same manner as people convicted for offences (at [33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">29 It follows that this ground is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">30 Mr Rivera asserts that, in the Extradition Treaty between Australia and the USA there is an implied condition that persons awaiting extradition be kept in gaols conducive to their states as unconvicted prisoners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">However, he could point to no article in the Treaty or the Protocol on which to base such an implication, which would be contrary to the Australian statutory regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">31 Mr Rivera also submits that it was an implied condition of his imprisonment that he be able to have access to material available in the Remand Centre but not in Parklea, to prepare for his various legal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">No basis for such an implication has been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Nor is it apparent that he is unable to prepare his cases from Parklea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">32 Mr Rivera also asserts that the Commonwealth cannot delegate conditions of imprisonment to the States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Section 120 of the Constitution and s 53 of the Act are sufficient answer to that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Order 80 
 
33 Mr Rivera seeks pro bono legal assistance to argue this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">First, I should say that Mr Rivera presented his case, both in writing and orally, articulately and with some skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Mr Rivera has been engaged in extensive litigation since his arrest in this country in 2002 in this Court, the Supreme Court of NSW, the High Court and HREOC in over a dozen separate proceedings, many of them of some complexity and conducted by him without the benefit of legal assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">34 I have considered whether it would be in the interests of justice to refer Mr Rivera's present application for pro bono assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I have considered whether there is an arguable basis for any of the matters relied on and have concluded that there is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In the circumstances it is not appropriate to make an order under Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules with respect to Mr Rivera's application for a writ of habeas corpus or the orders sought by him for transfer from Parklea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It follows that the claim for damages for unlawful imprisonment at Parklea and for an injunction to restrain the respondents from removing him from the Remand Centre would also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Conclusion 
 
35 No arguable case has been made out, or is apparent, to support the orders sought by Mr Rivera.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The proceedings should be dismissed under Order 20 Rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The application for an order under Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules should be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Mr Rivera should pay the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.</sentence>
