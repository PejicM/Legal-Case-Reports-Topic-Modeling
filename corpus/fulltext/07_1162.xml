 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 This is an appeal against an order of a Federal Magistrate dated 24 May 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of a delegate of the respondent ("the delegate") to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The appellant is a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China ("the PRC").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He first entered Australia on 17 August 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 28 February 1997, the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa claiming to have a well-founded fear of persecution following his alleged support and involvement with the Chinese Democracy Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 In refusing the appellant's visa application on 19 August 1997, the delegate did not accept on the available evidence that the appellant was of any significant interest to the PRC authorities and did not face persecution upon return to his country ("the Decision").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In drawing this conclusion, the delegate noted the relative ease with which the appellant had exited and re-entered the PRC on at least two previous occasions prior to him entering Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 Notification of the Decision was sent by post to the appellant's home address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It was returned unclaimed several days later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant had, in fact, nominated his post office box as the appropriate contact point for all correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">As a result, the appellant was not notified of the Decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 On 23 August 2005, the appellant informed the respondent of his new address for correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 14 September 2005, the respondent sent a letter to the appellant's new address notifying him of the Decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 An application to show cause why remedy should not be granted pursuant to s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") was lodged in the Federal Magistrates' Court on 22 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The respondent filed a notice of objection to competency alleging that the appellant had not identified a decision which was reviewable under s 476 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellant's application with costs on 24 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
 7 The appellant alleges the Federal Magistrate erred: 
 
 
 (1) in finding that there was no decision giving rise to the possibility of an application to show cause;
 (2) in finding that notification of the Decision was given on 14 September 2005;
 (3) in finding that the delay of over one year between notification of the Decision and the application to show cause was such that the relief should be refused on discretionary grounds; and
 (4) in determining that it was inappropriate for the Federal Magistrates' Court to determine that time had not expired for an application to the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") until the Tribunal had an opportunity itself to consider its own jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 
 8 For the reasons that follow, the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 GROUND 1 --- NO DECISION GIVING RISE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN APPLICATION TO SHOW CAUSE 
 
 9 There are, in my view, a number of answers to the appellant's complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">First, the Decision was and remains a valid decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Secondly, notification of the Decision in September 2005 did not constitute a separate decision and complied with ss 494B and 494C of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Thirdly, the Federal Magistrates' Court did not have jurisdiction in relation to the Decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The first matter requires identification of the provisions of the Migration Act in force on 19 August 1997 when the Decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The third matter requires consideration of s 476 of the Migration Act in force on 22 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 Decision was and remains a valid decision 
 
 10 The Decision was made on 19 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">At that time, the relevant provisions of the Migration Act were contained in Reprint no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 consolidated to 23 April 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">There were two amendments to that Act in the period between the reprint and the Decision: Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">3) 1997 , No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">92 of 1997 and Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Act 1997 , No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">118 of 1997 cl 48 of Schedule 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Neither of the amendments is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">At that time, the Migration Act provided that when the Minister granted or refused to grant a visa, he or she was to notify the applicant of the decision in the prescribed way: s 66(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Significantly, s 66(4) went on to provide that " [f]ailure to give notification of a decision [did] not affect the validity of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">" The Decision was and remains a valid decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 That outcome is not altogether harsh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Since 1992, s 412 in Part 7 of the Migration Act has provided that: 
 
 "(1) An application for review of an RRT-reviewable decision must: 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (b) be given to the Tribunal within the period prescribed, being a period ending not later than 28 days after the notification of the decision ; and 
 ... 
 (4) Regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) may specify different periods in relation to different classes of RRT-reviewable decisions (which may be decisions that relate to non-citizens in a specified place).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">" 
 
 (Emphasis added)
 
 
 The Decision was an 'RRT-reviewable decision' as that term is defined in the Migration Act : s 411 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Upon being notified of the Decision in September 2005, the appellant had a period of 28 days within which to seek a review of the Decision: s 412.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">12 Moreover, notification of the Decision cannot be treated as a separate 'decision' from the Decision for the purposes of s 476 of the Migration Act : Chung v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 442.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">As Conti J said in Chung (at [19]): 
 
 
 
 "For a decision-maker merely to communicate his or her decision to a person to be affected thereby, pursuant to his or her duty so to do, does not involve the making of a decision so to do within s 474(3) , particularly where the decision-maker is subject to a statutory obligation so to do, whether explicit or implicit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">" 
 
 
 
 13 This appeal was conducted by the parties on the basis that ss 494B and 494C of the Migration Act prescribed the methods by which the appellant was to be notified of the Decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Sections 494B and 494C were inserted into the Migration Act by Schedule 3 to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Electronic Transactions and Methods of Notification) Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">They took effect on 10 August 2001 and, as a matter of statutory construction, applied to the notification of the Decision by the Minister in 2005: Pearce DC and Geddes RS, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 5 th ed, para [7.23].</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">14 The appellant was notified of the Decision some 8 years after the Decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The appellant does not dispute he received notification in September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Counsel for the appellant contended that the notification regime in the Migration Act is strict and peremptory and that the Minister failed to comply with ss 494B and 494C .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He concedes the argument is technical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Minister contends that the notification complied with ss 494B and 494C and referred the Court to the decision of Allsop J in Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 at [49] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I adopt the reasoning of Allsop J in Zhan at [47]-[49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In my view, the Federal Magistrate was correct to conclude that there was notification of the decision in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The letter enclosing the decision was sent within three days of its date in the manner prescribed by ss 494B(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The fact that it enclosed the Decision made some years earlier is unfortunate but does not render the notification invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">As noted earlier, upon being notified of the Decision in September 2005, the appellant had a period of 28 days within which to seek a review of the Decision: s 412.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">He did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">15 Finally, the Decision was and is a 'primary decision' within the meaning of that term in Division 2 of Part 8 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Accordingly, the Federal Magistrates' Court had no jurisdiction in relation to the Decision: s 476 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">16 The appeal should be dismissed on this ground alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 GROUND 2 --- NOTIFICATION GIVEN IN SEPTEMBER 2005 
 
17 This ground of appeal substantially overlaps with ground 1 and should be dismissed on the same bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">GROUND 3 - DELAY OF OVER ONE YEAR BETWEEN NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISION AND THE APPLICATION TO SHOW CAUSE 
 
18 This ground of appeal substantially overlaps with ground 1 and should be dismissed on the same bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Federal Magistrates' Court had no jurisdiction in relation to the Decision: s 476 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">19 Even if the Court did have jurisdiction, it would have been appropriate to refuse relief having regard to the delay of one year and the availability of other suitable remedies which had been available to the appellant but not utilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">GROUND 4 - INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES' COURT TO DETERMINE THAT TIME HAD NOT EXPIRED FOR AN APPLICATION TO THE TRIBUNAL 
 
 20 No appellable error has been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It is inappropriate for the Court to pre-empt a decision of the Tribunal as to whether it has jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That is a question for the Tribunal: see Chung at [20].</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 ORDERS 
 
 21 For those reasons, the appeal should be dismissed and the appellant should pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
