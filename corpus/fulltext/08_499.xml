 This is an appeal against an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 1 August 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 5 March 2007 and handed down on 20 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (as the Minister was then known) to refuse to grant Protection (Class XA) visas to the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellants, who are husband (SZKMS) and wife (SZKMT), are citizens of Sri Lanka who arrived in Australia on 10 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 17 October 2006 the appellants lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (as it was then known).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for protection visas on 27 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 1 December 2006 the appellants applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Both appellants made claims under the Refugees Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant husband claimed a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He claimed that as a member of the National Youth Front, being the student wing of the United National Party (UNP), he had worked for a Cabinet Minister, the Prime Minister, and a local politician.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He claimed that throughout this period he received threats to stop working for the UNP, including being beaten and having a gun put in his mouth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On the night of local elections the appellant husband claimed that while he was at the politician's house, political opponents entered the appellant husband's home whilst his then fianc&eacute;e (SZKMT), mother and aunt were at home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They destroyed some items, asked where the appellant husband was and, when the appellant wife who was then his fianc&eacute;e refused to answer, they mistreated her and threatened to kill her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant husband claimed that shortly thereafter he made a complaint to the police and he and his then fianc&eacute;e moved to his sister's house in Kandy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He claimed to have been beaten and have his life threatened by supporters of the People's Liberation Front (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)) when standing at a bus stop with his fianc&eacute;e in Kandy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">When he returned to Columbo he was dragged into a car, had a gun pointed at him and warned that if he continued in politics he would "definitely" be killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant husband claimed that as a result of his fear he became sick and he and the appellant wife moved to her aunt's house in Ganemulla before leaving for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He feared that if he returned to Sri Lanka he would be killed by his "political enemies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The appellant wife also claimed she had a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">She said that at the end of January 2006 she moved into live with the appellant husband at his house in Attidiya, Columbo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In mid-February she was taken by her husband to the mayor's house for a dinner where her husband and the mayor discussed the upcoming local elections to be held on 30 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">She said that in mid-March one morning she saw a lot of people gathered around their house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">When she went outside people started to laugh at her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">She said she was embarrassed to see her name and humiliating things about her character were spray painted on the walls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She said that the words meant that her husband had used her to get votes for the party by "sending me with the politicians".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She said, "I cannot explain how embarrassing and humiliating it was, I walked out there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" She said that the next day people pointed at her and were talking about her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">She said that during the home invasion referred to in the appellant husband's claims, she was asked where the appellant husband was and was threatened that if she told the police about the attack they would rape and kill her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Further, she witnessed the beating of her husband at a bus stop in Kandy and, as a result, she was constantly fearful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The appellant wife claimed that after the husband told her he had been kidnapped and his life threatened, she took him to her aunt's place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">She realised both their lives were in danger so they decided to move to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">She fears that they will both be killed should they return to Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal accepted that the appellants were citizens of Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal accepted that the appellant husband was a member of the National Youth Front of the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal gave no weight to that involvement because of the appellant husband's evidence that not all UNP supporters face harm in Sri Lanka and because the appellant husband consistently claimed that the harm he faced, and still faces, was specifically based on his work undertaken directly on behalf of UNP politicians rather than merely his affiliation with the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal also gave no weight to independent country evidence provided by the appellant in relation to harm caused to members of the National Youth Front.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal found that the appellants were not credible witnesses because the appellants could not provide any evidence to support their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal found the appellants' reasons for the lack of such information "unimpressive and evasive", and concluded that the appellants' claims of persecution were fabricated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal also found that the claims in relation to the home invasion lacked credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Tribunal concluded by finding that, on the evidence, the appellant husband had no ongoing interest in politics in Sri Lanka and that neither appellant had any significant relationship with the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">On 12 April 2007 the appellants applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The appellants claimed that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error because it misunderstood the test of well-founded fear of persecution; breached s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) by not informing the appellants that they failed to provide documentary evidence in support of their claims; and based its decision on hypothetical questions and situations, particularly in relation to the alleged home invasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In written submissions, the appellants also claimed that the Tribunal failed to consider the claim that the wife appellant was threatened with rape and murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Her Honour described ground 1 as "a disagreement with the finding of the Tribunal that the Applicant husband has ' any genuine, ongoing interest in politics in Sri Lanka .</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">'" Her Honour found that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellants held a well-founded fear of persecution because of their failure to provide evidence and the Tribunal's finding that they lacked credibility, which were findings open to the Tribunal on the evidence and the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Her Honour also noted that the Tribunal informed the appellants of its concern regarding the lack of evidence and had adjourned the hearing to allow for the presentation of further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In relation to the second ground, her Honour noted that the Tribunal informed the appellant on several occasions that it required further evidence from the appellants to support their claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Her Honour said there was no obligation on the Tribunal to require particular documentary evidence from the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Her Honour found there was no obligation to raise the issue of a lack of evidence in the Tribunal's letter sent pursuant to s 424A as it was part of the Tribunal's thought processes and not "information": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal conducted a fair hearing under the Act and based its findings on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Her Honour found that the "hypothetical questions" referred to by the appellants merely represented the Tribunal's thought processes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Lastly, the Federal Magistrate held that the appellants' claims that the appellant wife was threatened had been properly considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">However, it was not satisfied that the home invasion was linked to the appellant husband's political involvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Therefore, her Honour noted that the Tribunal could not find the appellant wife had a well- founded fear of persecution relating to a Convention reason arising from those threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On 21 August 2007 the appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Three grounds were raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">First, that the Federal Magistrate erred in not finding the Tribunal came to the wrong conclusion on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Secondly, that the Federal Magistrate erred in law "by reading into the s 424 (sic) letter her own version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">" Thirdly, that the Federal Magistrate erred in not finding the Tribunal based its decision on hypothetical issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">On 25 January 2008 the appellants filed a further amended notice of appeal in which the appellants abandoned their original grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The grounds raised in the further amended notice of appeal are: 

1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Tribunal failed to make findings on material questions of fact in accordance with the Tribunal's obligations under s 430(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The material questions of fact said to be overlooked are particularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Tribunal failed to consider critical integers of the applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Tribunal breached s 425 of the Act in that its invitation to appear before the Tribunal was, in the circumstances of the case, "a hollow shell or empty gesture".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Tribunal erred in finding that the appellants' claims were "fabricated" without first addressing all the appellants' claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 At the hearing the appellants sought leave to amend the notice of appeal in accordance with the further amended notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">They also sought leave to adduce further evidence on the appeal, namely, the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal on 18 January and 14 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The first respondent opposed the application to amend the notice of appeal on the ground that the proposed amendments raised grounds of appeal which were not grounds relied on by the appellants in their application for review before her Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The proposed grounds of appeal do raise issues which were not relied on for the relief sought in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Moreover, the further amended notice of appeal abandons all of the grounds which were relied upon by the appellants before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The result would be, if leave were given to allow the further amended notice of appeal to stand as the grounds of appeal, that this Court would be called upon to consider for the first time an application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision based upon these new grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It would mean that the Appeal Court would be determining issues of fact and considering arguments for itself without the benefit of the opinion of the Court from which the appeal is brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Such a course is self-evidently unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">No explanation has been given for the failure to raise these grounds before the Federal Magistrate, save that the appellants were unrepresented before her Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It was also put that the first respondent would suffer no prejudice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It may be accepted that a person who is unrepresented on an application for judicial review is at a disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Such persons find it difficult to understand the limits of the inquiry on an application for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Moreover, they often find it difficult to articulate the grounds which might give rise to a successful application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The concept of jurisdictional error is not easy for unrepresented parties to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">However, that being said, being unrepresented on the application cannot, by itself, be enough to permit the unrepresented party to raise grounds which were not raised in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Nor is the fact that the Minister will not suffer any prejudice enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Parliament has given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction in relation to applications of this kind to the exclusion of this Court: s 476A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">All of the issues which are sought to be ventilated should be addressed at the trial in that Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Parliament has provided for a right of appeal to this Court and in matters of this kind the appellate jurisdiction of this Court may be exercised by a single Judge: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Indeed, that is the case on this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The High Court has made it plain that, ordinarily, a party is confined in its grounds of appeal to matters which have been raised in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The High Court said in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71: 
 
 It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case has been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 
 In Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 , the majority said at 7: 
 
 It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instances to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">
 
 The appellate process is to correct error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">If a party is entitled to raise issues for the first time on appeal, the appeal court will become de facto the primary court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That is undesirable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It is particularly undesirable where the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is being exercised by a single judge and any right of appeal from that single judge is to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">If a party is entitled to raise an issue for the first time on appeal in this Court, the High Court will be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from judges sitting alone who have not had their decision reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">That must be particularly undesirable from the High Court's point of view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Moreover, to allow new grounds of appeal is to defeat the purpose of the legislation which requires that judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to be within solely the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">If new grounds are advanced on appeal, it effectively means that the jurisdiction is being exercised by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Of course, appeals of this kind are particularly sensitive: Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is particularly important to the party seeking refugee status that that party's claim be considered by the Tribunal in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That said, however, it seems to me that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the appellate jurisdiction that parties be bound by the way in which they conducted their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court: H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 ; (2000) 63 ALD 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">However, the Full Court of this Court has recognised that a residual discretion resides in this Court to allow a party to advance a ground of appeal not advanced before the Court from which the appeal is brought where it is in the interests of justice to do so: Iyer [2000] FCA 1788.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 105 ; (2002) 190 ALR 543 , the Full Court adopted the test propounded by the High Court in appeals to that Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong [1985] HCA 28 ; 60 ALR 68 at 71 that a party is bound by the conduct of the party's case in the Court below except in "the most exceptional circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 , the Court said that leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the trial judge should only be granted "if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">" After referring to the dicta in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; 162 CLR 1 , the Court said that the Court may grant leave if the point which has not been raised in the Court below has merit and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting the point to be ventilated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Rarely will the Minister in an appeal to this Court from a migration judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court be able to point to any prejudice of the conventional kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">That cannot be a reason to allow a party to raise issues not raised in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">In Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 929 ; (2001) 192 ALR 71 , Gyles J said at 86: 
 
 In my opinion, it is wrong to analyse a question which arises here as requiring a balancing of prejudice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Departure from the proper role of appeal in the court system is not simply a discretionary procedural decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Furthermore, in public law matters like this, it can always be said that no actual prejudice apart from costs is suffered by the respondent compared with the prejudice to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It can easily be overlooked that there is a significant public interest in the timely and effective disposal of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">This aspect has particular force in this area of public law, where delays in dealing with applications for protection visas are obviously to be avoided if possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In the present case, there was no bona fide ground of appeal from the primary decision and the litigation should have ended at that point more than 7 months ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">
 
 The Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely disposal of applications for protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">There are other public interests, however, to which regard should be had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There are good reasons why this Court should not be made de facto the Court of original jurisdiction when sitting on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Otherwise its role as an intermediate Court of Appeal will be undermined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The High Court should not be burdened by applications for leave to appeal from decisions of this Court which have not been reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The respondent conceded that I needed to consider whether any of the grounds had any merit before determining whether or not I should allow the application to amend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The concession was rightly made having regard to the decisions of this Court and, in particular, VUAX [2004] FCAFC 158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Adopting that procedure, however, means that in every case where there is an application to raise a ground not previously raised in the Court below, the party seeking to have the ground agitated will by reason of the application itself require the Court to consider the ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It is a curious result when the Court would otherwise discourage such applications but a result which arises because the Court's overriding duty is to do justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The reason for the power to allow a party to raise a ground on appeal for the first time is to do justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The appellants contended in their written submissions that the thrust of grounds 1, 2 and 4 is that there was a failure by the Tribunal to consider all integers of the appellants' claims as contained in their written statements and their evidence at the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Ground 1 identified what was said to be material questions of fact about which there were said to be a statutory obligation to make findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">But the written submissions did not identify the integers of the appellants' claims which were not considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">I attempted to elicit from the appellants' counsel what claim it was that the Tribunal had failed to address but I was unable to obtain a direct answer as to the particular claim which the appellants made which was not addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The appellants' counsel sometimes contended that the appellant wife's claim of fear of persecution arose out of her political opinion and sometimes contended that her persecution arose out of her membership of a social group, being women who go with politicians for the purposes of securing votes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">At different stages he withdrew both contentions but, at other stages, renewed them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In the end result, in my opinion, neither claim was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The only claims on a reading of the appellants' documentary evidence and oral evidence was a claim that she feared persecution by reason of an imputed political opinion, being that of her husband's and a claim that she was a member of a particular social group, namely, the appellant husband's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The appellants' counsel sought to support his submission that the appellant wife had other claims which had not been considered by referring to the transcript of the hearing of the Tribunal on 18 January 2007 and 14 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">That necessitated a further application by the appellants to adduce further evidence on the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Court has power to receive further evidence on appeal: s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The transcript was not relevant in the grounds relied on in the application made to the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It would only be relevant if, of course, leave were given to the appellants to amend their grounds of appeal in accordance with the further amended notice of appeal and further leave be given to allow the appellants to raise issues not raised in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The first respondent opposed the tender of the transcript on the ground that it would not be relevant if I were to rule that the notice of appeal should not be allowed to be amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The appellants' application therefore to adduce further evidence depends upon the appellants succeeding on their application to amend the notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">I will have regard to the transcript to determine whether there is evidence to support the submission that the appellant wife's claims were not considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Tribunal conducted a hearing on 18 January 2007 at which both appellants gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">During the appellant wife's evidence she said that she did not know much about politics in the context of her being present at the dinner with the mayor prior to the 30 March 2006 election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">She was unable to say who had won that election on 30 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">She was asked about the episode in mid-March 2006 when she had said that humiliating things were spray painted on the walls of their house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It was contended that her answers to these questions suggested that she might have been acquiescing in the proposition that she was a person who went with politicians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It was contended that that was evidence of her involvement in politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">She was asked: 
 
 AW: They wanted like you know, where he is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">I didn't say anything, I was scared, I didn't want to just because though [A] is involved politics and they have said he has said all the stuff I always looked out for him I didn't really get involved with him, you know just to encourage him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">They wanted to know because anyway he had got threatened at that time and I forgot to tell you just before the elections as well they had written some stuff on the walls and spray painted that [A] is using me to go out with politicians and you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">M: And he was using you, your husband?</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">AW: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">M: He was using you to go out with politicians?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">AW: Yes, in very bad language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It was so humiliating too for me to go outside even.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Because it was a small area at Dehiwala so everyone knows what's happening around.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 I do not accept that to be a fair reading of her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">I think it is clear from her evidence that she was not acquiescing in the proposition that she went with politicians but agreeing with the Tribunal that that was what was painted on the walls of their house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">That seems to me to be clear by her last answer where she talks about "very bad language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">" That is also consistent with her written complaint to the Tribunal which I think makes it quite clear that she was humiliated by what she said were false claims made about her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I think it is clear on reading her evidence before the Tribunal on 18 January 2007 that she was not making a claim that she held political opinions or was interested in politics such that she feared persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">On 18 January 2007 the Tribunal hearing was adjourned to allow the appellants to comment on relevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">On 23 January 2007 the appellants were sent a letter from the Tribunal pursuant to s 424A inviting them to comment on certain aspects of evidence given at the hearing and explaining that the information was relevant as it went to the plausibility of the appellants' claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">On 5 February 2007 the appellants sent a response to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The hearing resumed on 14 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The appellant wife again gave evidence at the resumed hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">She said: 
 
 Like that day, when you asked me who won the election I didn't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It was that a parliamentary election or presidential election it's known by everyone, it was just a normal local council election so I was not quite interested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Even if it was presidential election after the votes were there, after two or three days I would know who had won and who is the president.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">I was not quite interested about politics I know my situation is totally different to his.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">He is into politics and I am not so after I was with him I experienced a lot of situations where I saw him getting beaten up and I was mistreated which the way I was brought up I was not I have never experienced it and you know because I was with grandmother and you know I experienced a lot of stuff and my parents are not being with me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">And so I get really close to him and I don't want anything happening to him or us, so we decided to stay there as long as we can but later on I told my mum and that's why we decided to come here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">
 
 I think her evidence on both 18 January 2007 and 14 February 2007 make it clear beyond doubt that her claim to a protection visa did not arise out of her political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">She disavowed any knowledge of politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Nor did it arise, as her counsel contended, as part of a particular social group, being women who go with politicians for the purposes of securing vote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In those circumstances, her claim to be a refugee depended on her husband establishing that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Insofar therefore as it is contended that the Tribunal failed to consider an integer of the appellant wife's claim, that contention must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">For completeness, it would be appropriate to consider that aspect in ground 1 which complains about the failure by the Tribunal to make findings on material questions of fact "in accordance with s 430(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">" Section 430(1)(c) provides: 
 
 
 (1) Where the Tribunal makes its decision on review, the Tribunal must prepare a written statement that:
 
 (c) sets out the findings on any material questions of fact; and
 
 ...
 
 
 
 Section 430(1)(c) does not oblige the Tribunal to make findings of fact that a court may consider to be material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">In Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 , McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [68]-[69] that the obligation on the Tribunal is to set out in its written statement its findings on what it considered to be material questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Grounds 2 and 4 address, as was contended by the appellants, the issue as to whether the Tribunal considered all integers of the appellants' claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It follows, therefore, that grounds 1, 2 and 4 which claim that the Tribunal failed to consider integers of the appellants' claims and, in particular, the appellant wife's claims, could not succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Ground 3 complains of the Tribunal's failure to comply with s 425 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Whilst the ground complains that the Tribunal's invitation was a "hollow shell or empty gesture", the ground does not identify in what way it is said that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">56 However, in the appellants' written submissions, it was put that the Tribunal reached its decision by reference to an issue other than that considered dispositive by the delegate, which was that the appellant husband had no significant relationship with the UNP in circumstances where the Tribunal failed to notify the appellant of that possibility which led the appellant to believe that his support and affiliation with the UNP "would not be questioned".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">There are a number of difficulties with this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">First, the premise upon which it is based is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">There was no finding made by the delegate that the appellant husband was a member of the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">There was an observation that that was his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The delegate did not, on the delegate's reasoning, need to make a finding of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Secondly, the appellants were put on notice that their involvement in politics was a live issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In the letter written by the Tribunal to the appellants on 23 January 2007 pursuant to s 424A, the appellants were told that on the state of the evidence before the Tribunal "[t]his could lead the Tribunal to doubt that the household, including [SZKMS], is involved in politics in the manner or to the degree claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">" That letter clearly put the appellants on notice that the degree of their involvement in politics was a matter under consideration which needed to be addressed by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The appellants had an opportunity to address that issue both in response to the s 424A letter and when the hearing before the Tribunal resumed on 14 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The proposed ground of appeal is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">That would be enough to deal with the proposed grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">However, in their counsel's written submissions, counsel raised even further issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It was submitted that the Tribunal erred in failing to address the question of relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Next, it was submitted that the Tribunal erred by misconstruing the test of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Lastly, it was said that any lack of corroboration of the appellants' evidence did not support the Tribunal's findings where there is no obligation in law to adduce corroborative evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It would probably be enough to deal with these further submissions by observing that they do not address either the grounds of appeal in the existing notice of appeal or any of the proposed grounds of appeal in the further amended notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">However, for completeness, I shall address the matters briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">There was no need to consider the question of relocation because a finding was made that the appellants had not established that they had a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The question of relocation would only have arisen if a contrary finding had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The Tribunal did not err by inquiring into whether the appellant had suffered "sustained or systemic" harm in circumstances where it found that the appellant had suffered no harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It did not thereby misconstrue the test of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Lastly, the Tribunal did not purport to suggest that corroboration was required as a matter of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">It simply found that there was no corroborative evidence in circumstances where such evidence should have been available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The application to amend the notice of appeal is rejected because the proposed grounds of appeal were not grounds upon which the appellants relied in their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court and each of the grounds lack merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The application to adduce further evidence is refused because leave to amend the notice of appeal has been refused and, in those circumstances, the proposed evidence is not relevant to any of the existing grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It follows from my refusal to allow the appellants to amend their notice of appeal that the grounds of appeal identified in the existing notice of appeal must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">I shall 

do so even though they were abandoned in the proposed further amended notice of appeal and not addressed in the appellants' submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">
 The first ground of appeal is a restatement of the first ground for judicial review before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It is, as the Federal Magistrate rightly pointed out, no more than a claim to have the Court perform a merits review of the Tribunal's finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Her Honour dealt extensively with this ground in her reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">An application for a judicial review of an administrative decision does not give rise to a merits review of the decision: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The purpose of the review is to determine whether the Tribunal has exercised its power in accordance with its obligations and, in particular, without jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The Federal Magistrates Court and this Court has limited jurisdiction to determine whether the Tribunal has made jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">If no jurisdictional error is shown, then the Tribunal's decision cannot be quashed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is not entirely clear what is meant by the second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Her Honour said in her reasons that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to require the Tribunal to write to the applicant pursuant to the provisions of s 424A requiring particular documentary evidence to be adduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">That clearly was right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">She also said that if the Tribunal was of the opinion that there was a lack of evidence before the Tribunal, that was not information for the purposes of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">That also is clearly right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The second ground must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It is also not entirely clear what is meant by the third ground, although an examination of her Honour's reasons does assist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It was put to her Honour as part of the third ground in support of the application for judicial review that the Tribunal had erred in questioning why it was that the appellant husband was not subject to further attacks after the home invasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Federal Magistrate rejected the argument that such an approach amounted to a consideration of a hypothetical situation or hypothetical issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The Tribunal gave consideration to the issue which it identified in considering whether or not the appellant husband's account was credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">It was not a hypothetical issue but it was a reason in the Tribunal's opinion why the appellant husband's account could not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">In my opinion, none of the grounds of appeal have been made out and the appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The appellants must pay the respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">
