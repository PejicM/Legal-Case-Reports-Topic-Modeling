<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') makes provision for applications for visas and for the consideration by the Minister of such applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Section 65(1) of the Act relevantly provides:
 
 
 
 '65(1) After considering a valid application for a visa, the Minister: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) if satisfied that: 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (ii) the other criteria for it prescribed by this Act or the regulations have been satisfied; ... 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 is to grant the visa; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if not so satisfied, is to refuse to grant the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">' 
 
 


 
2 The relevant criterion for a Protection (Class XA) visa is to be found in s 36(2)(a) of the Act, which provides:
 
 
 
 '36(2) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is: 
 
 


 
 (a) a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; ...' 


 
3 The reference to the Refugees Convention is to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967, and I will collectively refer to the Convention as amended by the Protocol as 'the Refugees Convention'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 Article 1A of the Refugees Convention relevantly provides:
 
 'For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "refugee" shall apply to any person who: 
 
 
 
 (2) ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ... religion ... is outside the country of his nationality and ... owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; ...' 
 


 
5 Proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') are not adversarial but inquisitorial; the Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A Tribunal Member conducting the inquiry is not an adversarial cross-examiner, but an inquisitor obliged to be fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In an application for review before the Tribunal, it is for the applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he wishes to advance, and for the Tribunal to decide whether his claim has been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is not part of the function of the Tribunal to seek to damage the credibility of an applicant's story in the manner a cross-examiner might seek to damage the credibility of a witness being cross-examined in adversarial litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">6 The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark upon (see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs); Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57] --- [58]; see also SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenshi p (2007) 237 ALR 64 at [30]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">7 As was pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553, the relevant provisions of the Act do not require that the Tribunal actively assist an applicant in putting his or her case, nor does it require the Tribunal to carry out an inquiry in order to identify what that case might be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">8 In relation to a hearing before the Tribunal, it is clear that the Tribunal should afford an opportunity to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in respect of the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Procedural fairness does not require the Tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of pre-judgment (per Gleeson CJ, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ( 2006) [2006] HCA 63 ; 231 ALR 592 at [48] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">9 Section 424A(1) of the Act relevantly provides:
 
 '424A(1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must: 
 
 
 (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and 
 
 
 
 
 (c) invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">' 
 
 
 
 

10 In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 which was handed down on 13 June 2007, the High Court gave close attention to the circumstances in which section 424A would be engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">At [22] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Hayden and Crennan JJ drew attention to the 'limited scope of s 424A ' and at [15] and [21] they said:
 
 ' [15] ... Section 424A does not require notice to be given of every matter the tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">... 
 ... 
 
 [21] ... Section 424A has a more limited operation than the appellants assumed: its effect is not to create a back-door route to a merits review in the federal courts of credibility findings made by the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">...' 
 

Importantly, their Honours held at [17] that: 
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The use of the future conditional tense (would be) rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) [was] to be determined in advance --- and independently --- of the tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 
 (Emphasis added)
 

11 At [18] their Honours approved a passage in the joint reasons for judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 477 saying:
 
 ' [18] ... Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word "information": 


 
 
 ...does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc ... 
 


 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">...' 
 
 (Footnotes omitted) 


 
12 At [17] their Honours pointed out that the Tribunal did not operate in a statutory vacuum and that its role was dependent upon the making of administrative decisions upon criteria to be found elsewhere in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They pointed out that the appropriate criterion in respect of a protection visa was to be found in ' s 36(1) ' (sic) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">They proceeded to say at [17]:
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The "reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">When viewed in that light , [the operation of s 424A(1)(a) having to be determined in advance --- and independently - of the tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case] it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellants' statutory declaration would itself be "information that the tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellants' claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">...' 
 
 (Emphasis added) 


 
13 The appellant in this case signed an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa in the name which I will identify as 'L' (family name) and 'G ... Q ...' (given names).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He has been identified for the purposes of these proceedings as SZIVM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The application for a protection visa indicates that the appellant was born in Henan in the People's Republic of China on 29 September 1960.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">14 On 28 February 2005 a passport was issued in the name of 'LGQ'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">On or about 16 August 2005 a temporary business visa was issued by the Commonwealth of Australia, which was endorsed on that passport, allowing entry into Australia for a period of three months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On or about 24 August 2005, the passport was endorsed with a Hong Kong entry permit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">15 On 26 August 2005 the appellant arrived in Melbourne having travelled on the passport to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">16 The appellant's application for a Protection (Class XA) visa was lodged on 5 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 23 November 2005 the Minister's delegate refused to grant a visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">On 23 December 2005 he applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He was invited to, and attended, a hearing before the Tribunal on 15 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">17 On or about 13 February 2006 the appellant forwarded a letter to the Tribunal by facsimile which included an assertion that the appellant's real name was not as indicated on the passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It asserted that his real name was another name and that he was born on 20 August 1972.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He provided names for his wife and asserted that he had a son bearing his surname and a daughter bearing his surname, that surname being a different name from that which was included in the passport and in the application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">18 On 17 March 2006 the Tribunal as then constituted decided to affirm the decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse the application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">That decision was handed down on 6 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">19 On 21 September 2006 Lloyd-Jones FM made orders by consent quashing the decision of the Tribunal of 17 March 2006, and ordering that the Tribunal reconsider the matter according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">20 On 25 October 2006 an invitation was extended to the appellant to attend a hearing before the Tribunal on 7 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A further communication was sent to the Tribunal requesting a rescheduling of the hearing, and on 24 November 2006 the new hearing date of 22 December 2006 was fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">21 In the Tribunal's invitation of 25 October 2006, the Tribunal informed the appellant that it had considered the material before it in relation to his application, but was unable to make a decision in his favour on that information alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He was invited to come to a hearing of the Tribunal 'to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of [his] claims'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He was also advised that he could ask the Tribunal to obtain oral evidence from another person or persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">22 On 22 December 2006 the appellant attended a hearing before the Tribunal, which lasted from approximately 1:35 pm until 3:25 pm on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Thereafter, on 16 January 2007 the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse the appellant's application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">That decision was handed down on 27 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">23 An application for review of that decision was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 3 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was heard by Driver FM on 8 August 2007, his Honour ordering that the application be dismissed and that the appellant pay the respondent Minister's costs in the amount of $5000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">24 On the hearing of the application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, it would appear that an affidavit of S.M.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Bragg was read, which attached a transcript of the hearing in the Tribunal on 22 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The transcript is, needless to say, expressed in the English language and during the course of the hearing of the appeal I have invited the interpreter to interpret large passages from that transcript to ensure that there was no misunderstanding in the mind of the appellant about what was there in relation to the alleged change of identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">25 In the course of his oral submissions, the appellant said that he had asked the Tribunal to make further investigation about his true identity and the Tribunal said words to the effect, 'that is unnecessary'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I have been unable to find anything in the transcript to support the submission that the Tribunal said that further investigation concerning the appellant's true identity was 'unnecessary'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The closest that the transcript comes to dealing with that subject-matter is to be found in that part of the transcript which is reproduced at page 141 of the appeal book in the following exchange:
 
 
 'TM Well why did you wait till 2 days before the hearing and your name if the reason I am asking you this sir is that the fact that you haven't told someone about your claimed name until 2 days before the Tribunal considered your application for review causes me to doubt that information about the name is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">[The reference to the hearing was to the initial Tribunal hearing on 15 February 2006] 
 
 
 
 
 
 A I wasn't there to say that before when I first came but 2 days before the hearing sorry one month before the hearing I told I received something about this hearing and 2 days before I thought if I didn't tell them if I didn't tell then I would still be cheating the Australian government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">So I want to say when this passport was handed in for visa application in China the photo on it was not mine and you can even check that out on the web.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 
 
 TM I am not going to check that out on the web.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">...' 


 
(Emphasis added)

 
26 Following the dismissal by the learned Federal Magistrate of the appellant's application for review of the Tribunal's decision following the second Tribunal hearing on 22 December 2006, the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court on 29 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">27 The grounds of appeal specified in the Notice of Appeal are two in number, and bear a strong resemblance to those specified in the application for Constitutional writ relief filed by the appellant in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The first ground of appeal was expressed as follows:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The applicant claims that he (sic) RRT acted capriciously and arbitrarily and formed its assessment of satisfaction on illogical reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The current Tribunal repeated the error that the previous Tribunal made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The current Tribunal made an incorrect conclusion about the applicant's identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The applicant claimed to be Mr [Z...Y...] but entered Australia using a fraudulent passport showing the name of [L... G...] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Tribunal failed to accept the various documents the applicant has provided to support his true identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Tribunal failed to undertake further examination to verify the applicant's true identity despite the applicant has (sic) asked the Tribunal to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 


 
28 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">That finding was significantly influenced by the late provision to the earlier Tribunal hearing of the claim in respect of identity, to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Tribunal found that the first claim of a different identity was one which was made two days before the earlier Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The Tribunal said:
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Given that the Tribunal does not consider that the applicant is a truthful witness it finds that these documents are not reliable evidence of the facts in/portrayed in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The Tribunal finds that he invented the claim about his identity to assist his application for protection in that it would serve to explain how he managed to leave China on the passport that he presented to the Tribunal in his own name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">' 


 
29 The passport referred to of course was that to which I have made reference earlier in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">30 It seems to me that it was entirely open to the Tribunal to reach the conclusion which it did with respect to the design of the appellant in relation to the submission of the claim in respect of substituted identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">31 The appellant has not correctly summarised what transpired at the Tribunal hearing when he asserted that he had asked for further investigation to be made by the Tribunal about his true identity and about the Tribunal responding with words to the effect that that was unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">32 As has previously been pointed out in these reasons, it was not for the Tribunal to actively assist the appellant in putting his case, and it was for him to advance whatever evidence he wished to advance in support of his claim for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It was no part of the Tribunal's role to undertake an investigation for him in the manner that he suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">33 The second ground of appeal was expressed as follows:
 
 '2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The applicant claims that The (sic) RRT failed to afford the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The current Tribunal failed to give the applicant information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review and the Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to comment on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">By failing to do so the Tribunal breached the Section 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The current Tribunal rejected the applicant's claims about his second daughter who could not be registered in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Tribunal rejected this claims (sic) because the Tribunal thought it was a recent invention by the applicant to assist his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to comment why he had not made such claims earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">' 


 
34 It is abundantly clear from the authorities referred to earlier that it was no part of the Tribunal's responsibility to give the appellant a running commentary on his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It is also abundantly clear that doubts and concerns which the Tribunal may have had about the genuineness of the appellant's claim concerning his second daughter were not matters which came within the reach of s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">35 When I asked the appellant to address me on the second ground of appeal, he indicated that he was not familiar with Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It was apparent to me that he had no knowledge whatsoever of s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">His explanation for the ground appearing in the Notice of Appeal was simply that he asked a friend to have a look at it [referring to the second Tribunal decision] and his 'friend' said that the Tribunal had breached s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I am satisfied that it did not breach that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">36 The Tribunal said in relation to the second daughter:
 
 'The applicant also said at the end of the hearing before the present Tribunal that he has second daughter who cannot be registered in China and cannot get an education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He told this Tribunal that he has told no one else this before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">To the extent that the applicant is claiming that he/his family member is/was persecuted in China for this reason the Tribunal finds that this claim is recent invention to assist his application for protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In the Tribunal's view if this claim were genuine he would have made it before this Tribunal hearing and his oral evidence to the Tribunal is that he did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">There is no plausible evidence before the Tribunal that the applicant has a second daughter as he claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 


 
37 In my opinion it was open to the Tribunal to draw these conclusions in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">38 The Tribunal concluded that it did not accept that the applicant left China and/or fears to return there for the reasons which he claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In his application for a protection visa, the applicant had essentially indicated that in about 1995 he became associated with the underground Christian group in China known as Hu Han Pai, also known as the 'Shouters' group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">His claim had been that he had an involvement in that group for a period of perhaps one year, following which there was a long period when 'we did not practice because the local government kept monitoring us'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The appellant's case was that he had in 2004 re-organised a small group consisting of four people 'all from the company I worked for'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He gave them copies of his Bible and other publications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He says that he didn't know about how the police found out about his group but one day they:
 
 '... came to our company and searched for us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Two of us were detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I and one other member were not in the office and we ran away after hearing the news.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">' 


 
39 The appellant said that he came to Australia on a visitor visa so that the Chinese government could not find him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">40 Not only do the grounds of appeal fail, it seems clear that it was open to the Tribunal on the material before it to conclude that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">41 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Associate:
