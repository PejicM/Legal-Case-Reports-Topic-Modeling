 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In this proceeding, the applicant challenges the Minister's decision to cancel a bridging visa granted to the applicant in May 1997 and the Minister's subsequent decision not to revoke that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The decisions under challenge were made in early June 2005 and on 12 October 2005 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This is not the first time that these two decisions have been the subject of judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">For the reasons I am about to state, I would dismiss his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The applicant arrived in Australia on 1 February 1997 on a Temporary Business Entry (Class UC) visa, subclass 456.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He was subsequently granted a further subclass 456 visa, which expired on 26 May 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The history of the applicant's further visas is a complicated one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 23 May 1997, the applicant was granted a Bridging visa A (Class WA) visa, subclass 010 and also applied for a Business --- Long Stay visa, subclass 457.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A delegate of the Minister refused his application for a long stay business visa on 16 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant unsuccessfully applied to the Migration Internal Review Office, which affirmed the delegate's decision on 7 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The bridging visa granted in May 1997 allowed the applicant to remain in Australia until 28 days after he was notified of the decision of the Migration Internal Review Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 Also in June 1997, Interpol contacted the Australian Federal Police regarding serious criminal offences allegedly committed by the applicant in China before he entered Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">A year later, in June 1998, the Australian Federal Police received an arrest warrant issued by Tianjin Public Security Bureau in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Police passed this information to officers of the Minister's Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 On 8 December 1998, the applicant was granted a Bridging visa A and lodged an application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">A delegate of the Minister refused the applicant's protection visa application on 20 January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant unsuccessfully applied for review by the Refugee Review Tribunal, which affirmed the delegate's decision on 17 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal's decision was set aside by this Court on 18 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The bridging visa granted in December 1998 expired 28 days after the Tribunal's decision, that is, on 14 January 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Assuming (as the Minister's Department did) that the applicant had no other visa than this visa, the applicant became an unlawful non-citizen after 14 January 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 Departmental efforts to locate the applicant failed until 24 February 2004, when the applicant was stopped by the Victorian police for a traffic offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The police notified the Department and the applicant was taken into immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Shortly afterwards, on 27 February 2004, the applicant applied for a Bridging visa E. A delegate of the Minister refused this application on 2 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicant unsuccessfully applied for review by the Migration Review Tribunal, which affirmed the delegate's decision on 12 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 Two days earlier, on 10 March 2004, Interpol issued a "Red Notice" setting out information relating to the allegations made against the applicant by the Chinese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Under the heading "Fugitive wanted for prosecution" the Interpol Red Notice gave particulars of the alleged fugitive, including name, birth, nationality, and physical description, as well as particulars of "judicial information".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The "Summary of facts of the case" under this latter heading read as follows:
 CHINA, Tianjin: On 20 December 1996, [the applicant] and two accomplices kidnapped a 15-year-old boy and killed him as they did not receive the ransom of RMB 1,5000,000 (EUR 145,000) they had demanded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The charge was said to be kidnapping and murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On 23 June 2004, the applicant was informed that a warrant for his arrest had been issued by the Chinese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The applicant remained in immigration detention in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">8 On 23 May 2005, a Departmental officer examined the relevant files and decided that the applicant had never been correctly notified of the decision of the Migration Internal Review Office in September 1998 affirming the delegate's decision to refuse the applicant a long stay business visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A consequence of this failure was that the bridging visa granted in May 1997 was still current.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Accordingly, on the basis of the Departmental officer's decision, the applicant was released from detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">9 On 25 May 2005, Departmental officers interviewed the applicant and issued him with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of the May 1997 bridging visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">After the interview, a delegate of the Minister decided to cancel this bridging visa and the applicant was detained in immigration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On 26 May 2005, the applicant applied to the Migration Review Tribunal for review and, on 7 June 2005, the Tribunal set aside the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">10 In early June 2005, the Minister at the time made one of the decisions challenged in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This was the Minister's decision to cancel the applicant's bridging visa under s 501(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">By a letter dated 9 June 2005, the applicant and his legal representatives were informed of the cancellation decision and were also given, amongst other things: (1) a statement of the Minister's reasons; (2) the Interpol Red Notice; (3) the warrant of arrest issued by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau; and (4) Ministerial General Direction Number 21 --- " Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">11 By letters dated 16 June 2005 and 9 August 2005, the applicant made representations to the Minister under s 501C of the Migration Act as to why the Minister's decision should be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">On 12 October 2005, the Minister made the second decision under challenge in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">This was the Minister's decision not to revoke her decision to cancel the applicant's bridging visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">12 On 26 October 2005, the applicant commenced a proceeding in this Court, which was transferred in the following month to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A Federal Magistrate dismissed the applicant's application to set aside the Minister's decisions on 26 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The applicant did not seek to appeal against this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">13 On 22 May 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided a note that "they will not carry out the death penalty for crimes that the individual whose repatriation has been requested, [the applicant], committed before repatriation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">14 Two years later, on 8 October 2007, the applicant filed an application in the High Court of Australia seeking constitutional writs in respect of the decisions under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">This application was supported by affidavits sworn by the applicant and his solicitor, Ms Psihogios-Billington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On 18 October 2007, the proceeding "including any application for enlargement of time" was remitted to the Federal Court, "to be heard and determined subject to Part 25 of the High Court Rules 2004 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
15 In order to understand the issues that fall for determination, it may be helpful to set out the relevant provisions of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">16 The Minister's decision to cancel the applicant's visa was made under s 501(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This and related provisions read as follows:
 Decision of Minister --- natural justice does not apply (3) The Minister may: (a) refuse to grant a visa to a person; or (b) cancel a visa that has been granted to a person; 
 
 if: 
 
(c) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and (d) the Minister is satisfied that the refusal or cancellation is in the national interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 (4) The power under subsection (3) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
 
 (5) The rules of natural justice, and the code of procedure set out in Subdivision AB of Division 3 of Part 2 , do not apply to a decision under subsection (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 Character test (6) For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if: (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or (b) the person has or has had an association with someone else, or with a group or organisation, whom the Minister reasonably suspects has been or is involved in criminal conduct; or (c) having regard to either or both of the following: (i) the person's past and present criminal conduct; (ii) the person's past and present general conduct; the person is not of good character; or (d) in the event the person were allowed to enter or to remain in Australia, there is a significant risk that the person would: (i) engage in criminal conduct in Australia; or (ii) harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia; or (iii) vilify a segment of the Australian community; or (iv) incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community; or (v) represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of that community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, or in any other way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Otherwise, the person passes the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It is common ground that the applicant does not have a substantial criminal record as defined in s 501(7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">17 The Minister's decision not to revoke her decision to cancel the applicant's visa was made under s 501C , which relevantly provides:
 
 
 (1) This section applies if the Minister makes a decision (the original decision ) under subsection 501(3) or 501A(3) to: 
 
 (a) refuse to grant a visa to a person; or (b) cancel a visa that has been granted to a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 (2) For the purposes of this section, relevant information is information (other than non-disclosable information) that the Minister considers: 
 
 (a) would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for making the original decision; and (b) is specifically about the person or another person and is not just about a class of persons of which the person or other person is a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">(3) As soon as practicable after making the original decision, the Minister must: (a) give the person, in the way that the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances: (i) a written notice that sets out the original decision; and (ii) particulars of the relevant information; and (b) except in a case where the person is not entitled to make representations about revocation of the original decision ... invite the person to make representations to the Minister, within the period and in the manner ascertained in accordance with the regulations, about revocation of the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">(4) The Minister may revoke the original decision if: (a) the person makes representations in accordance with the invitation; and (b) the person satisfies the Minister that the person passes the character test (as defined by section 501).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">(5) The power under subsection (4) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">... (8) If the Minister makes a decision (the subsequent decision) to revoke, or not to revoke, the original decision, the Minister must cause notice of the making of the subsequent decision to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the subsequent decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">... (11) A decision not to exercise the power conferred by subsection (4) is not reviewable under Part 5 or 7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">18 Section 5 defines "non-disclosable information" as, among other things, "information ... whose disclosure would, in the Minister's opinion, be contrary to the national interest because it would ... prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">THE MINISTER'S DECISIONS 
 
19 The Minister gave reasons for the decision pursuant to s 501(3) and (6)(c)(ii) to cancel the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Minister's reason relevantly read:
 CHARACTER TEST 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">On 26 May 1997, an arrest warrant was issued by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau in respect of [the applicant].</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On 10 March 2004, an Interpol Red Notice was issued for the arrest of [the applicant].</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">This notice stated that, on 20 December 1996, [the applicant] and two accomplices kidnapped a 15-year old boy and killed him after they did not receive the ransom ... they had demanded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">My Department also received further information relating to [the applicant's] character, which is protected under section 503A of the [Migration Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is my practice to be guided by the General Direction 21 ... in considering the application of the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The Direction states (at paragraph 1.10) that, in the absence of countervailing factors, a non-citizen is not of good character if they are the subject of unresolved charges involving serious offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I considered [the applicant's] alleged conduct to be very serious, and noted that there was no evidence that he is seeking to address these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">On this basis, I formed the necessary suspicion that [the applicant] is not of good character on account of his past and present general conduct, and that he therefore does not pass the character test by virtue of s 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">NATIONAL INTEREST 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I considered that Australia's international reputation and good standing would be damaged if it provided, or was seen to provide, a safe haven for people who have committed serious crimes in another country, or are wanted to face charges for such crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">On this basis, I was satisfied that cancellation of [the applicant's] visa was in the national interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">20 Under the heading "Discretion" and the sub-heading "Protection of the Australian Community", the Minister stated that she gave "primary consideration to the protection of the Australian community, taking into account the seriousness and nature of [the applicant's] alleged conduct, the likelihood that such conduct might be repeated and whether visa cancellation in this instance would have a deterrent effect".</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As to each consideration, the Minister said:
 (a) Seriousness and nature of conduct 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">[The applicant] has been accused by the [Chinese] authorities of kidnapping a 15-year-old boy and, later, killing him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">This constitutes a crime that I consider to be very serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The nature of [the applicant's] alleged conduct, in the absence of any evidence to indicate that he is attempting to rectify or dispute these allegations with [Chinese] authorities, is such that I gave this consideration great weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">(b) Risk of recidivism 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">I considered that I had insufficient information before me to assess [the applicant's] risk of recidivism, given that he has not been convicted of any criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Accordingly I did not place any weight on this consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">(c) General deterrence 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I considered that I had insufficient information before me to assess whether cancellation of [the applicant's] visa would have a deterrent effect on others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Accordingly I did not place any weight on this consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">21 The Minister also stated that she gave "primary consideration to the expectations of the Australian community", concluding:
 
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Australians would not want their community to be a haven for non-citizens seeking to avoid prosecution for serious crimes in another country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In this regard, I noted that there is no evidence that [the applicant] is attempting to rectify or dispute these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In view of the serious nature of [the applicant's] alleged offences, and given that there is no evidence that he is seeking to contest the allegations in [China], I believe that the Australian community would expect [the applicant's] visa to be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">I gave moderate weight to this consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 

22 Finally, before stating her conclusion, the Minister noted that she gave "some weight" to that fact that: (1) the applicant "does not appear to have any family, business or social ties to the Australian community, and that [her] Department has no evidence of rehabilitation or recent good conduct"; and (2) "the possible engagement of Australia's international obligations in relation to [the applicant], should he ultimately be returned to [China]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">23 The Minister concluded that:
 
 
 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I considered all relevant matters including (1) the evidence set out in the issues paper and its attachments; (2) an assessment of the character test as defined by s 501(6) of the Act; (3) an assessment of the national interest; and (4) the Ministerial Direction under s 499 of the Act and decided to cancel [the applicant's] visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In reaching my decision, I concluded that the seriousness of the charges and the expectations of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
 
24 In relation to the Minister's subsequent decision in October 2005 not to revoke her earlier decision, a statement signed by the Minister said:
 
 
 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I have considered all representations made on behalf of [the applicant] in relation to my decision to cancel [the applicant's] subclass 010 (Bridging A) visa under s 501(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">I have also considered all other relevant matters including (1) the evidence set out in the original issues paper and its attachments, (2) the character test as defined by s 501(6) of the Migration Act 1958, (3) Direction 21 under s 499 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I have decided that: 
 
 ... (c) I AM NOT SATISFIED that [the applicant] passes the character test and, therefore, my original decision to cancel [the applicant's] visa under s 501(3) of that Act is NOT REVOKED.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">THE APPLICATION 
 
25 An amended application was filed, with leave, after the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This amended application reflected the case made by the applicant at the hearing on 31 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">By this amended application, which was filed on 4 August 2008, the applicant seeks judicial review of the Minister's decisions, first, to cancel his visa and, secondly, not to revoke the cancellation decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">To the extent necessary, the applicant also seeks an enlargement of time for the filing of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">26 The grounds upon which the applicant relies are: 
 
(1) the decision of the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa was made for an ulterior or improper purpose because the purpose was to extradite the applicant to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Put another way, "[t]he available material and the circumstances of this case support an inference that the Minister was actuated by the purpose of assisting the Chinese authorities in a form of disguised extradition".</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">(2) there was no evidence to support the finding that the applicant did not pass the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">At most, there were allegations of criminal conduct unsupported by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">(3) the Minister took into account an irrelevant consideration that there was no evidence that [the applicant] was seeking to address these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">(4) the Minister's decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would have made it because the Minister took into account and relied heavily on the fact that there was no evidence that [the applicant] was seeking to address these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(5) The Minister could not, on any reasonable basis, have reached the decision that the applicant was not of good character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">27 The applicant did not pursue an earlier posited denial of natural justice/procedural fairness ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">THE APPLICANT'S SUBMISSIONS 
 
28 The applicant argued, first, that, on the material before the Court, there was "a proper basis for an inference that when the Minister made the decision to cancel the applicant's visa, [the Minister] did so with the intent of returning him to face criminal charges in China".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">If this were the Minister's purpose, then, so the applicant submitted, it was an improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">29 The applicant relied on the following factors as providing the basis for inferring that the Minister's purpose was to return the applicant to China to meet the charges against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">(a) At the time of the Minister's decision, there was no extradition treaty between China and Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">(b) In the Minister's written statement of reasons, it was noted four times that the applicant had not sought to address these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">(c) The decision to cancel the applicant's visa was "solely based on the outstanding alleged charges".</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">(d) The Minister considered, as a relevant matter, that Australia could not be seen to provide, in the Minister's words, "a safe haven for people who have committed serious crimes in another country, or are wanted to face charges for such crimes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">(e) The decision to cancel the applicant's visa was based on "mere allegations without any documentary foundation or proof, such as in the nature of an authenticated or signed warrant, charge sheets, witness statements, forensic evidence etc".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">(f) China had requested "the applicant's removal/extradition to face the alleged criminal charges".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">(g) The decision to cancel the applicant's visa was made, in part, on the basis of present conduct, that is, the applicant's failure to address the allegations through the Chinese legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">(h) The Minister personally cancelled the applicant's visa immediately after the Tribunal's decision setting aside the decision to cancel the applicant's visa under s 116(1)(e) of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal had specifically noted that: (1) the charges against the applicant were serious, but that these were no more than allegations against the applicant, which he had denied; (2) Australia had done nothing to facilitate removal of the applicant to China, although aware of the allegations since 1997; and (3) there was neither an extradition request nor evidence justifying such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">(i) Some time prior to the Minister's decision to cancel the applicant's visa, the executive government had undertaken "an international treaties obligations assessment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The applicant argued that, since there was evidence justifying an inference of improper purpose, then the "onus ... shifts to the Minister to disprove the purpose".</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">30 Secondly, the applicant argued that "[t]he decision that the applicant was not of good character was made on the basis that he had outstanding or unresolved charges" against him and "[t]here was no evidence of any outstanding or unresolved charges".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Instead, according to the applicant, there were merely "allegations supported by scant material of a hearsay nature and unsourced".</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">31 Thirdly, the applicant contended that the Minister took into account an irrelevant consideration when referring, as she did, to the fact that that there was no evidence that the applicant was seeking to address the allegations against him through the Chinese legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The applicant argued that this consideration was irrelevant to the Minister's consideration of the character test and to the exercise of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">32 The applicant contended that there could be no "positive expectation or obligation ... to contact the prosecuting country in relation to an outstanding prosecution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The applicant submitted that such an obligation "would be unfair and unduly harsh, particularly in light of the circumstances", including that: (1) the applicant had "previously represented that China has a ... system of corruption, abuse and unaccountability"; (2) the allegations against him "date back to 1996 and the applicant was first made aware of them in 2004"; (3) the applicant had "not been provided with any brief of evidence or, at the very least, charge sheets"; (4) the applicant had consistently denied his involvement in the alleged crimes; and (5) the applicant had been in immigration detention for the past several years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">33 The applicant sought such extensions of time as were necessary, although conceding that he had given no explanation for the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The applicant argued that, notwithstanding the dismissal of his previous application for judicial review, there were special circumstances justifying judicial re-examination of the Minister's decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">RESPONDENT'S SUBMISSIONS 
 
34 The respondent argued that the Court should not enlarge the time limits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The respondent submitted that the two years' delay between the making of the Minister's second decision in October 2005 and the commencement of this proceeding in the High Court in October 2007 was a "considerable" one, which had not been explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">35 The respondent contended that there were no special circumstances that would justify the Court in holding that the applicant was not estopped from bringing the claims the subject of this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">36 The respondent submitted that the applicant had not made out his case on improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The respondent argued that:
 Provided the purpose of an exercise of power under these provisions remains to regulate ... the entry and presence of aliens in Australia, the fact that exercises of power under these provisions might also take into account other considerations, including the reputation of Australia, will not bring such exercises outside the subject matter, scope and purposes of these provisions and the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The consideration of Australia being used or being seen to be used as a safe haven was a matter going to the regulation of aliens' entry and presence in Australia, and was a consideration within the scope of the provisions and the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">37 The respondent submitted that the Minister's reasons showed that she was actuated by her assessment of the Australian community's expectation that the bridging visa should be cancelled, and not by "the purpose of complying with a request from the [Chinese authorities] to surrender the Applicant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was, so the respondent said, a proper consideration, which demonstrated a proper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">38 The respondent contended that the existence and contents of the Interpol Red Notice meant that the no evidence ground must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The respondent further submitted that s 501 of the Migration Act conferred a broad discretion, which entitled the Minister to have regard to the matters mentioned in her reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Further, the respondent argued that "[t]he contents of the Interpol Red Notice [were] a probative basis for the finding of reasonable suspicion that the Applicant did not pass the character test, and a basis for the exercise of discretion against him".</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The respondent further submitted that:
 The observations of the Minister are not to be judged through a prism of criminal law procedures concerning the Crown's burden of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The question is not whether the reasoning process was 'unfair or unduly harsh', but whether there was a probative basis for the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Interpol Red Notice provided such a basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">39 In supplementary contentions filed with leave, the respondent submitted that it was not open to the applicant to rely on the Wednesbury unreasonableness ground in challenging the anterior process by which the Minister formed her satisfaction of reasonable suspicion that the applicant did not pass the character test, because this ground was directed to the outcome of the discretion and, in this case, it was plainly open to a reasonable decision-maker to cancel the applicant's visa on the basis of the Interpol Red Notice and the arrest warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Further, the respondent argued that the applicant's failure to contests the allegations was a probative matter in relation to each of two particular factors informing the exercise of the Minister's discretion: (a) the seriousness and nature of the allegations; and (b) community expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">CONSIDERATION 
 
40 I commence this discussion by assuming, for the moment, that the applicant could overcome any expired time limits and the estoppel problem, and turn to the merits of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">At the end of these reasons, I examine whether this assumption is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Ground 1 --- Improper purpose 
 
41 The applicant's improper purpose argument was solely directed to the Minister's decision under s 501(3) to cancel the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The applicant's argument was, presumably, that, if this decision were vitiated by an improper purpose, then neither it nor the Minister's subsequent decision under s 501C(4) not to revoke it would stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Alternatively, perhaps, the applicant assumed that, if the Minister had an improper purpose in making the first decision, the Minister's purpose was the same in making the subsequent decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It is unnecessary to explore whether these assumptions should be accepted, because I would reject the case the applicant seeks to make as to improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">42 The nature of the power that s 501(3) confers must be borne steadily in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Under s 501(3) of the Migration Act , the Minister may cancel a visa if the Minister reasonably suspects that the visa-holder does not pass the character test; and the Minister is satisfied that the cancellation is in the national interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">A visa-holder does not pass the character test if, having regard to "the person's past and present general conduct", the person is not of good character: see s 501(6)(c)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">43 In June 2005, the Minister stated that she reasonably suspected that the applicant did not pass the character test, because, having regard to the applicant's past and present conduct, the applicant was not of good character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Minister's statement of reasons made it clear that the Minister reached this conclusion having regard to the fact that: (1) the Tianjin Public Security Bureau had issued an arrest warrant for the applicant in May 1997; (2) an Interpol Red Notice had been issued for the applicant's arrest in March 2004, stating that the applicant was wanted for the kidnap and killing of a 15-year-old boy; (3) further information about the applicant's character had been received (which was protected under s 503A of the Migration Act ); and (4) General Direction No 21 stated in [1.10] that, in the absence of countervailing factors, a non-citizen was not of good character if he was the subject of unresolved charges involving serious offences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The Minister assessed the applicant's alleged conduct as "very serious" and noted there was "no evidence" that he was seeking "to address these allegations through" the Chinese legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">44 It was clearly open to the Minister to consider each of the facts to which her reasons referred and to assess the conduct alleged against the applicant as "very serious".</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The applicant did not challenge the effect of [1.10] of General Direction No 21, being a direction issued under s 499 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">If the Minister had been aware that the applicant had sought to address the allegations via the Chinese legal system and had taken this fact into account, it could scarcely be said that the Minister had acted improperly in so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">It is, therefore, difficult to maintain (as the applicant does) that the Minister acted improperly in merely noting that the applicant had done nothing of this kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Moreover, in this context, it does not appear that this "noting" indicated that the noted matter weighed heavily against the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The "noting" might signify that little could be drawn from the applicant's conduct in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Perhaps, the most that the noting indicated was that the applicant's response to the allegations was not a factor positively militating in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">This "noting" provides no basis for the inference as to improper purpose that the applicant would have the Court draw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">45 The terms of s 501(3) also required the Minister to have regard to whether cancellation was in the national interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Absent anything in the statutory context that might limit the conception, national interest is a very broad conception indeed, which is ordinarily given content by the executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Minister concluded that cancellation was in the national interest because she "considered that Australia's international reputation and good standing would be damaged if it provided, or was seen to provide, a safe haven for people who have committed serious crimes in another country, or are wanted to face charges for such crimes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The damage to Australia's international reputation that might result from allowing a non-citizen to remain in the country plainly falls within the ordinary conception of national interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">An essential purpose of a power such as s 501(3) confers is to regulate the entry into, and presence in, Australia of non-citizens: see Migration Act , ss 4(1) and 4 (4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">If (as in this case) the purpose of the exercise of the power is to bring to an end a non-citizen's presence in Australia, by reference to the very kind of matter to which the provision directs attention, the proposition that the exercise of power was for a purpose other than the statutory purpose fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">46 The Minister's reasons show that there were two considerations to which she gave greatest weight in exercising her discretion: (1) the protection of the Australian community; and (2) the expectations of the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In connection with the former matter, the Minister considered, amongst other things, the seriousness and nature of the applicant's alleged conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In connection with the latter matter, the Minister sought to articulate community expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">It was plainly open to the Minister to take this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The applicant relies on the Minister's articulation of community expectations, which after stating Australians would not want their community to be a safe haven for non-citizens seeking to avoid prosecution, again "noted" that there was "no evidence" that the applicant was "attempting to rectify or dispute these allegations through the [Chinese] legal system".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The applicant also relies on the fact that the Minister made the same comment after again referring to the "very serious" nature of the conduct alleged against the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In this regard, however, I would repeat my observations in [45] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">As indicated above, perhaps the most that this noting indicates is that the applicant's response to the allegations cannot amount to a factor positively militating in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It provides no basis for the inference as to improper purpose that the applicant would have the Court draw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">47 As the respondent acknowledged, the Minister doubtless knew that, if the applicant were removed from Australia, he would be returned to China since he was a citizen of that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It might reasonably be assumed that, on his return, he would be arrested and face the charges to which the Interpol Red Notice referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It does not follow from this, however, that the Minister's purpose in cancelling the applicant's visa under s 501(3) was to effect his extradition to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Unless it can be said that the Minister's purpose in exercising power under s 501(3) was to bring the applicant to justice in China, the exercise of power was not an improper one: see Schlieske v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1988) 84 ALR 719 at 731 per Wilcox and French JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In Schlieske 84 ALR at 731, a case concerned with the lawfulness of a Ministerial deportation order, their Honours said: 
 The golden rule is that the Australian authorities are entitled, notwithstanding their knowledge that a particular deportee is wanted in the country of destination, to do everything which is necessary for the enforcement of the Migration Act ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">But they are not entitled to go beyond that, and in purported exercise of powers under that Act, to take steps whose only purpose is the bringing to justice of the deportee in a foreign country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">At that stage the Australian authorities would not be exercising deportation powers; they would be involved in an unlawful extradition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">48 The reasons that the Minister gave for the decision to cancel the applicant's visa under s 501(3) do not provide any sufficient basis for an inference of improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The cogency and weight of the material before the Minister was for the Minister to assess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Provided there was a probative basis for the decision, it is not open to the Court to second-guess the Minister in this regard and, in so doing, impute an improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Further, the fact that the Minister's decision followed almost immediately on the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal cannot be regarded as indicative of improper purpose since the Minister's powers under s 501 of the Migration Act are separate and distinct from those of the Tribunal: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Gunner (1998) 84 FCR 400 at 408-09 per Heerey, Lindgren and Emmett JJ, approved in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 535 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J; also 565 per Hayne J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The applicant's reference to "an international treaties obligations assessment" is, as the respondent observes, irrelevant in the present connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">49 For the reasons stated, even if the applicant passed the threshold difficulties of delay and estoppel, I would reject the first ground that the applicant advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Grounds 3 and 4 --- Irrelevant Consideration and Unreasonableness 
 
50 These two grounds both focussed on the fact, referred to already, that the Minister's reasons for her decision to cancel the applicant's visa under s 501(3) "noted", on three occasions, that there was "no evidence" that the applicant was seeking to address the allegations as to his conduct in kidnapping and killing a child "through the [Chinese] legal system" (see [5], [17], [18]) and, on a fourth occasion (see [11]), referred to the absence of this evidence in the context of the weight to be given to the seriousness of the alleged conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Accordingly, I deal with these two grounds together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">51 The argument for the applicant focussed on the asserted fact that the applicant had no positive obligation to contact the Chinese prosecuting authorities; the time that had elapsed since the issue of a warrant for his arrest and his being made aware of the allegations against him; his position as an immigration detainee; his denials; and the lack of "a brief of evidence or charge sheets".</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">If the applicant's failure was to take up the matter with the relevant Chinese authorities was not irrelevant, then, so the applicant said, it was "of no probative value" and, thus, the consideration was "unreasonable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">I would reject these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">52 Section 501 of the Migration Act confers a very wide discretion, which permits the Minister to take into account a variety of matters, providing they are within the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Huynh [2004] FCAFC 256 ; (2004) 139 FCR 505 at 523 per Kiefel and Bennett JJ; Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 310 per Tamberlin, Sackville and Stone JJ; Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580 at 595 per Ryan, Lander and Crennan JJ; and Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 106 ; (2005) 142 FCR 402 at 423 per Ryan and Tamberlin JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In exercise of the discretion that s 501 confers, the Minister may consider such matters as the protection of the community and community expectations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">As the discussion concerning ground 1 shows, the Minister had a basis for regarding as relevant the fact that the applicant had not attempted to dispute the allegations with the authorities in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The consideration was not irrelevant in the sense that it did not lie within the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the statutory power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It was for the Minister to determine whether she would have regard to the consideration and, if so, how much weight should be given to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">53 For much the same reason, it cannot be said to have been unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense for the Minister to refer to the fact that the applicant had not sought to dispute the allegations with the authorities in China, assuming for the moment that Wednesbury unreasonableness might cover such a complaint as the applicant makes here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">This is not to say that the applicant had a positive legal duty to take the matter up with the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This would go too far.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">As indicated above, the point being made by the Minister is a narrow one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It may have been a fact militating in his favour had the applicant sought to contest the allegation within the Chinese legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The applicant had not done so and, therefore, this circumstance could not assist him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It was, as I have said, open to the Minister to take this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">54 Further, the Wednesbury unreasonableness ground, as stated by Brennan CJ in Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 36, relies upon the proposition that "when a discretionary power is statutorily conferred on a repository, the power must be exercised reasonably, for the legislature is taken to intend that the discretion be so exercised": see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 650 per Gummow J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Where a body fails to act in this way, the body acts beyond power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I am inclined to accept that, as the respondent submitted, the applicant's challenge is directed to a strand in the process of the Minister's reasoning, as opposed to the actual exercise of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">That is, the nature of the applicant's challenge is not one that falls within the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">55 In relation to these irrelevant consideration and unreasonableness grounds, the applicant raised three other subsidiary arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">First, a question was raised as to whether the Minister had proper regard to the applicant's "past and present general conduct" as s 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Migration Act required him to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The Minster's reasons for deciding to cancel the applicant's visa made clear that she did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">It will be recalled that the Minister stated that she considered the applicant's alleged (past) conduct to be very serious and noted that there was no evidence that he was (presently) seeking to address these allegations within the Chinese legal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The fact that, so far as the Minister's decision was concerned, the most significant conduct was the applicant's past conduct does not detract from this conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">56 Secondly, the applicant contended that the Minister's approach cast a positive burden of proof on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There was no burden of proof as such cast on the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">What the applicant complained of was the product of the statutory regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Under s 501(3) , the discretion to cancel a visa arises when the Minister "reasonably suspects" that the visa-holder does not pass the character test (as set out in s 501(6)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Section 501C(4) then operates so as to require a person whose visa has been so cancelled to satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test before the discretion to revoke the cancellation decision is enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The applicant in this case failed to satisfy the Minister that he passed the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Grounds 2 and 5 --- No evidence or no reasonable basis for finding or deciding that the applicant did not pass the character test 
 
57 These two grounds covered essentially the same argument and, accordingly, I also deal with them together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">As noted above, these grounds relied on the applicant's argument that there was no evidence to support the Minister's finding as to character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">I would reject these grounds for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">58 First, the applicant's argument disregarded the fact that, under s 501(3) , the Minister was merely required to form a "reasonable suspicion" that the applicant did not pass the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The contents of the Interpol Red Notice provided a legitimate basis for this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The Interpol Red Notice referred to a "charge" of kidnapping and murder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Secondly, the applicant sought to assess the Minister's exercise of discretion under s 501(3) by reference to principles applicable within the Australian criminal system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">An assessment of this kind is inappropriate in the present context, which is concerned with an exercise of Ministerial discretion to cancel a visa, having regard to considerations disclosed to the Minister in the course of administering the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Procedures and standards applicable under the Australian criminal law are inapplicable in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">59 For the foregoing reasons, I would reject the challenge to the Minister's decisions that the applicant sought to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">ESTOPPEL 
 
60 As the respondent contended, however, the principle in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 was applicable to this proceeding and, unless there were special circumstances shown, the applicant was estopped from bringing this further judicial review proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It will be recalled that the applicant had previously sought judicial review of the Minister's cancellation and non-revocation decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court on the ground that the decisions disclosed jurisdictional error in that the Minister: (1) failed to take into account a relevant matter; and (2) breached the rules of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Further, the applicant alleged jurisdictional error in that:
 Given the circumstances surrounding the allegations against the Applicant and the absence over a seven and a half year period of any attempt to execute the warrants or initiate extradition proceedings, each of the decisions amounted to a misuse of the cancellation power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">62 A Federal Magistrates dismissed the judicial review application on 26 May 2006, and the applicant did not seek to appeal against the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">In the circumstances, the Anshun principle applied: see Anshun [1981] HCA 45 ; 147 CLR 589 at 602.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The applicant submitted, however, that he ought not be precluded from raising new grounds of judicial review as there were "special circumstances" within the meaning of the Anshun principle to justify him doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">63 These special circumstances included that:
 
(a) There was no special disadvantage for the respondent but there was a significant adverse consequence for the applicant, being "a real risk to his life and liberty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">(b) The Minister did not take into account the applicant's concerns, including his complaints about the application of s 503A, although the applicant had raised them with the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">(c) There was a public interest in ensuring that the process of cancellation was a fair one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">In this case, the Minister's decision was vitiated as a "disguised extradition" or for unreasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">(d) The Minster and/or her department became aware of these serious allegations in 1998 but they were not put to the applicant until 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">(e) The applicant had unsuccessfully sought redress through other legal avenues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">(f) The applicant had been in immigration detention since May 2005 and had been diagnosed as having a major depressive disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">64 For the following reasons, I consider that this submission should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">First, as the Court said in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10 at 20:
 There may be sound reasons of policy for arguing that Anshun estoppel not apply for the benefit of the executive government and its representatives, but only to individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">This is because the executive is a respondent by force of statute or of the Constitution and is not subject to the same psychological burden that may weigh on individual litigants; they cannot be "vexed" in the same way by instigation of subsequent proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">That may be a more appropriate basis, namely that of accepted public policy, to ensure that representatives of the executive government cannot rely on the principle of Anshun estoppel to frustrate, in effect, the intended legislative mandate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">However that proposition does not sit well with the authorities that apply the principle of Anshun estoppel equally to judicial review of administrative action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">65 Secondly, the grounds of review upon which the applicant would seek to rely were available to him when the Federal Magistrate heard the earlier proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">There was no relevant uncertainty in the law, which might explain and justify the failure to raise them at the earlier time: compare BC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 221 at [31] - [37] per Carr, Tamberlin and Conti JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Further, although the applicant's written submissions questioned the application of s 503A, the applicant abandoned this argument at the hearing: see also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450 at [72] - [91] per Jacobson and Bennett JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It is also to be borne in mind that, in the Federal Magistrates Court, although not the subject of oral submissions, the applicant's amended application included a ground that resembled the "disguised extradition" ground, which the applicant sought to raise in this proceeding (see [61] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">66 Thirdly, I do not consider it was open to the applicant to attribute fault to the respondent on account of the respondent's alleged delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">As the factual outline above discloses, the Department was unable to locate the applicant for the four years prior to his meeting with the Victoria Police in February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">In any event, I accept that any delay on the respondent's part had no bearing on the applicant's failure to raise the present grounds in his previous judicial review proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Further, the applicant had legal representation in the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding, a factor which militates the relevance of arguments based on his immigration detention and alleged depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The fact that the applicant had sought and failed to achieve a resolution of his immigration status that was favourable to him had little bearing and did not constitute a special circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">67 Accordingly, the applicant did not, in my view, show special circumstances and he is estopped from bringing the claims that are the subject of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">EXTENSION OF TIME 
 
68 Given that the applicant is estopped from bringing this application, it is probably unnecessary to say much about the time limits made applicable by the order remitting the proceeding to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The applicant applied in the High Court for orders to show cause why writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus should not issue, although he did not include a claim for mandamus in his amended application filed on 4 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The High Court Rules 2004 relevantly limit the time for making application for certiorari and mandamus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Rule 25.06.01 provides that an application for an order to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not issue must be made within six months after the date of the relevant judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Rule 25.07.2 provides that an application for an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue to a judicial tribunal must be made within two months of the date of the refusal to hear or within such time as is, under special circumstances, allowed by the Court or a Justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Assuming that the time limits in rule 25.06.01 and 25.07.2 apply (see Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 234 ALR 114 at 120 indicating that r 25.07.2 does not), they may be enlarged under rule 4.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">69 The application was made in the High Court some two years after the Minister made her decision not to revoke her cancellation decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The applicant conceded that he had given no satisfactory explanation for the delay: see Re Commonwealth; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491 at 495 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Further, the applicant did not proffer any explanation as to why the grounds pursued in this proceeding were not pursued in the earlier proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Just as importantly, as the forgoing discussion shows, the prospects of success on the application are not such as to warrant an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">An extension of time for seeking relief of this kind "can only be granted if it is necessary to do justice between the parties": see Marks 177 ALR at 495.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">An extension of time is not necessary to do justice in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Accordingly, I would refuse the application for an enlargement of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">DISPOSITION 
 
70 For the reasons stated, the application should be dismissed, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Application to enlarge time should also be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">I certify that the preceding seventy (70) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
