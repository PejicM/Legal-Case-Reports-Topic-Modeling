 1 The appellants, a husband and wife, are citizens of India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They arrived in Australia on 29 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 25 February 2003 they applied for a protection visa (class XA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Only the husband made claims to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant wife was included as a member of the family unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">For convenience, the appellant husband shall be referred to as the appellant in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 On 13 March 2003, a delegate of the first respondent refused the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT") for review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 30 July 2004, the RRT handed down its decision affirming the decision not to grant protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 25 August 2004, the appellant filed an application, pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking review of the RRT's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 The Federal Magistrates Court heard the application for review on 2 May 2005 and delivered judgment dismissing the application on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant now appeals from that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 I share the concerns expressed by the learned Federal Magistrate about this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant appears genuinely to fear for his safety if he should return to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The RRT accepted this, but found that there was no Convention reason behind these fears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Federal Magistrate found no error in the RRT's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">For the reasons I am about to give, I find no error in the judgment of his Honour or in the decision of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Appellant's Claims Before the RRT 
 
5 Before the RRT, the appellant claimed that he and his wife left India because of his fear of being persecuted due to an unpaid debt and his political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He explained that he had borrowed a substantial sum from money lenders for his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He was unable to keep up with the payments of this debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 The appellant claimed to be an active member of a political party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He claimed that one of the leaders of the money lenders has strong links with a political party opposed to his own and to extremist groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 The appellant claimed that, after he failed to pay his debts, the money lenders threatened to beat him up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Some months later, they came to his store and beat him severely enough that he required hospitalisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He reported this incident to the police and there were no further assaults at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 With assistance, he obtained a visa for Australia and he and his wife came here leaving their young children in the custody of grandparents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The appellant hoped he would be able to earn sufficient money in Australia to repay the loan but he has been unable to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">His family in India has received threats saying that he will be harmed if he returns to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Decision of the RRT 
 
9 The RRT accepted the appellant's account of his experiences in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It concluded that he had a genuine fear of persecution and there was a real chance he would suffer serious harm were he to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The RRT found, however, that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the persecution he feared was for one the five reasons enumerated (race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group and political opinion) in Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees ("the Convention").</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The RRT was not satisfied that there was "any nexus at all" between the harm feared by the appellant and any Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The RRT therefore concluded that, under s 91R(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1959 (Cth) ("the Act"), the appellant was not eligible for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 The RRT noted that the appellant's own testimony at the hearing supported its conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant was asked directly whether his political activities had anything to do with his problems with the money lenders and he acknowledged that they did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court 
 
11 The appellant appeared in person in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He submitted brief written contentions of fact and law in which he argued that there was a nexus between the harm he feared and his political association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In these contentions, he stated that, although the initial cause of his problems for his difficulties was his debt, the money lenders will use their political affiliations to harm him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">12 His Honour held that the RRT had applied the law correctly and that its findings were open to it on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Accordingly, he dismissed the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Consideration 
 
13 The appellant did not file any written contentions of fact and law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He appeared in person today and reiterated the claims he made before the RRT and the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In particular, he submitted that the money lenders who were pursuing him were connected with political and criminal groups and that he would not be at risk if he were part of those groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The RRT considered these claims and found that there was no relevant connection between the persecution the appellant feared and any Convention reason, including persecution on the ground of political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It was plainly open to the RRT on the evidence to so find.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There is no error of law revealed in the RRT's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">14 The Notice of Appeal purported to raise nine grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">These grounds were not particularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">A number of the grounds are no more than citation of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The appellant has not explained how any these cases are relevant to this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I am unable to discern how they would help the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">15 The appellant also claimed that the Federal Magistrate failed to consider that, given the situation in his country, he would face persecution in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This claim is incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The RRT and, thus, his Honour accepted that there was a real chance that the appellant would suffer serious harm if he returned to his home town and was unable to repay his debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The difficulty, so far as the appellant is concerned, is that his Honour (and the RRT) found that the appellant's claims of harm at the hands of the debt collectors needed to have a relevant nexus with a Convention reason to satisfy the criteria for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">His Honour found no error in the Tribunal's finding that there was no such nexus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I can discern no error in his Honour's judgment in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">16 In his Notice of Appeal the appellant also claimed that he sought to file a transcript of the RRT hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court but his request was not considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">He withdrew this claim today, saying that he made no such request of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">17 For the reasons stated, the appellant has shown no error in the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that there was no error in the RRT's decision and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Associate:
