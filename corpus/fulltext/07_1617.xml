 1.0 Introduction 
 
 1 The applicant Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleges that between January 2000 and October 2004 companies in the Visy Group and certain officers of those companies engaged in price fixing and market sharing with companies in the Amcor Group, contrary to s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondents have admitted liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Court has been asked to impose penalties and make other appropriate orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The parties have tendered an agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This means that the parties agree that, for the purposes of this proceeding, the facts in this statement are not to be disputed: see Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 191.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The parties say that this agreement is not to be taken as an admission to those facts outside the context of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I am not bound to accept facts merely because they have been agreed between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Also I can draw inferences from such of the agreed facts as are accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 Visy and Amcor were the major participants in the market for the supply of corrugated fibreboard packaging (CFP) products in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Between them they held over 90 per cent of that market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 Broadly speaking, the contraventions fall into four categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 First, there was an Over-arching Understanding made in early 2000 under which Amcor and Visy agreed to maintain their respective market shares and not to deal with each other's customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">If a customer did change suppliers, the firm receiving that new customer would provide one of its own to the other by way of "compensation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In effect, there would be a swapping of customers (although the customers were not to know this).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Further, Visy and Amcor would collaborate with each other in order to increase prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 Secondly, there were Annual Price Increase Understandings whereby increases in prices were agreed in each of the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Thirdly, there were Customer Price Understandings whereby prices were agreed in respect of particular customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 Fourthly, there were Compensation Understandings whereby, in respect of particular customers who had changed from one supplier to the other, that supplier would provide another customer or customers in exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It worked this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">If, say, Amcor customer X decided to switch to Visy, Amcor and Visy would get together and decide on a Visy customer, say Y, who would be provided to Amcor as "compensation" for the loss of X.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">When Y's contract came up for renegotiation, Visy and Amcor would exchange details of proposed prices and other terms so as to ensure that the deal offered to Y by Visy was much less attractive than Amcor's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Y would then, as Visy and Amcor intended, accept Amcor's offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 The Commission has not proceeded against those on the Amcor side of this cartel because in late 2004 Amcor approached the Commission and admitted liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Commission applied its Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct, published in 2003, under which the first party to disclose a cartel of which the Commission is unaware will receive an immunity, provided it is not the "clear leader", gives full and frank disclosure, and continues to cooperate with the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In unrelated litigation Amcor had sued former executives and obtained a Court order for a search of their premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Incriminating material, including tape recordings of conversations, was discovered and on its solicitors' advice Amcor approached the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Details of these events will be found in my earlier judgment on an interlocutory application: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 444 at [7] - [52] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 2.0 The CFP market 
 
 9 A vast range of consumer goods are packaged in CFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">They include groceries, beverages, dairy products, fruit, produce, meat, poultry, seafood and confectionery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Returnable plastic crates, shrink wrap and other packaging products compete in segments of the CFP market, but otherwise there are no packaging materials which are reasonably substitutable for, or in close competition with, CFP products in relation to the packaging of the goods mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">CFP is used to make the ubiquitous cardboard box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">10 The type of CFP products and associated services supplied by Visy and Amcor would vary substantially between customers due to differing customer requirements in terms of board paper type, strength, construction, sheet size, design style, print characteristics and method of assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Different board grates were used in the manufacture for supply of CFP products to suit the different applications of the products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Corrugated boxed were supplied in a number of different styles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">CFP products could have printing applied either in a pre-print or post-print process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">11 In most cases CFP products were supplied to the customer's specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In particular industries, some standard sized CFP boxes were used, such as fruit and other produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">However, further value adding could be required such as the individual customer's logo or product information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">12 The CFP services supplied by Visy and Amcor in connection with the supply of CFP products included performance and quality testing, art graphics and printing services, packaging design, performance and cost optimisation, development services, tooling and packaging systems, transport and delivery, warehousing of stock and supply chain cost analysis services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">13 The cost of supplying different CFP products is affected by product type, dimensions, board grade, printing, order quantity, freight and other factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">14 From 2000 to 2004 the value of the CFP market was between $1.8 and $2 billion per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Details of some individual customers' requirements have been the subject of confidential evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">However, it can be said that some of the larger customers would have annual purchases of the order of $20 million or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There were thousands of non-contract customers who contributed approximately $212 million per annum in gross sales, constituting 30 per cent in value of Visy's customers
 15 Visy and Amcor were in competition with each other in the CFP market, except where such competition was reduced or eliminated as a result of the cartel conduct with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 3.0 Visy's CFP operations 
 
 16 The relevant company of the Visy Group is the third respondent Visy Board Pty Limited to which I shall refer hereafter simply as Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Visy manufactures CFP products from both recycled and kraft (ie virgin) paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It has manufacturing plants at Dandenong, Campbellfield and (since 2002) Wodonga in Victoria, Warwick Farm and Smithfield in New South Wales, Carole Park in Queensland; Gepps Cross in South Australia, and O'Connor in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">17 Visy is a vertically integrated operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It purchases packaging paper from another member of the Visy Group, Visy Pulp and Paper Pty Ltd, which operates seven manufacturing establishments in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">They produce annually more than 1 million tonnes of packaging paper, of which 750,000 tonnes is made from recycled paper and 300,000 tonnes from kraft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">18 Since 2000 the Visy Group has increased its production capacity and production of both pulp and paper products and CFP products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">19 Since 1995 Visy increasingly experienced production capacity constraints, particularly in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Transport of products across State borders alleviated these constraints, but this added to distribution costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In 2002 Visy's new Wodonga plant commenced operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This substantially increased Visy's production capacity for Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">20 The best available estimate of market share of CFP supplied is the estimated share by volume per square metre of CFP sheet manufactured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The following table sets out the approximate share of the CFP market in Australia between the financial years 1999 and 2005:

 21 During the period January 2000 to October 2004 Visy supplied approximately 250 to 300 companies that had been customers of the Amcor Group immediately beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The estimated annual sales value of those customers was $75 to $80 million per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">During the same period Visy ceased supplying approximately 100 to 125 companies by reason that they had entered into supply arrangements with the Amcor Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Estimated annual sales value of those customers was $40 to $45 million per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The numbers of customers moving between Amcor and Visy during that period includes customers referred to hereafter as having been transferred as "compensation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">22 Most of Visy's and Amcor's largest customers were supplied under specifically negotiated contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">These contracts specified the manner in which prices would be reviewed during the term of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Typically, prices were held constant for a period and then increased by a specified fraction of CPI increases or cost movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">23 The contracts negotiated between suppliers of CFP and individual customers dealt with a number of practical matters, including technical specifications of each product which for some of the large customers could run to sometimes thousands of different products, order quantities, special palletising requirements, special packaging equipment, delivery, and timing of deliveries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">24 Such matters affected the price to be charged by suppliers of the CFP for the products and services to be supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The charges could be affected by terms as to the period during which prices would be held constant and the manner of the increase, charges for the cost of tooling, volume rebates, discounts for early payment, sign on fees and contribution to capital requirements of a customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Contracts sometimes included a "meet the market" clause by which the customer was entitled to seek prices from another supplier and, if the supplier did not agree to meet that price, the customer could obtain supply from the other supplier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">25 The majority of contracts with customers are renewed or extended with the existing supplier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">However a customer might seek an offer from an alternative supplier under a "meet the market" clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In such a case supply may not change but the method is used to market check the price levels or competitiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">26 If a customer decides to seek an offer or tender from an alternative supplier, the tender process typically lasts several months and requires substantial expenditure, both for the potential alternative supplier and the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">This is because typically the customer purchases a large number of CFP products and the alternative supplier must undertake a process of learning about the customer's requirements and its current products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">27 An incumbent supplier has a number of advantages during that tender process, including the existing commercial relationship, a better understanding of the customer's product requirements, forecasting schedule and order patterns, current equipment on site, less transaction costs for the customer, familiarity with the customer's intellectual property and technology and the operation of the "better the devil you know" factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">28 Costing an offer for a new customer depends on a number of factors including board grades, box design, printing requirements, the number of passes in the separate manufacturing task, minimum quantities for each order, the number of stock keeping units (SKU) that is an individual CFP product with a designated order number, delivery times and waste levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">29 During 2000 to 2003 Visy implemented a general price increase to its non-contract customers once a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Its standard terms and conditions permitted Visy to increase prices on giving 30 days notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Visy would determine the amount and date of the increase and advise its State managers to write to non-contract customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">State mangers had the discretion to determine whether to implement in respect of any particular customer the four general price increases which occurred from 2000 to 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That discretion was in fact exercised on some occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">30 In the two year period to late 1999 both Visy and Amcor had incurred significant net trading losses due in part to a price war between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">From January 2000 Visy adopted some strategies to return the business to profit including cessation of free equipment deals, improved trading terms, increased charges for tooling services and volume focus to shift to retention of large accounts and growth in small/medium accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 4.0 Visy personnel 
 
 31 At the time of the contraventions, the fourth respondent Mr Richard Pratt was a director of Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It is a private company owned by Mr Pratt and his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">As can be seen from the brief description of its operations, Visy is a very large company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Visy Group of which it is a member is larger again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">32 The fifth respondent Mr Harry Debney was the Chief Executive Officer of Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">33 The sixth respondent Mr Rod Carroll was the General Manager of Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">34 Mr Pratt is still a director of Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Debney and Mr Carroll have resigned their respective positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 5.0 Amcor personnel 
 
 35 Mr Russell Jones was the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Amcor Limited, the holding company of the Amcor Group and a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">36 Mr Peter Brown was the Managing Director of Amcor Australasia, a division of Amcor Limited which conducted the business of manufacturing and supplying CFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">37 Mr Peter Sutton was from 1 July to 30 September 2003 Deputy Managing Director of Amcor Australasia and from 1 October 2003 until 6 December 2004 the Managing Director of that division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">38 From 1 February 2000 until 30 June 2000 Mr James Hodgson was Group General Manager, Corrugating, Northern Region, of Amcor Fibre Packaging Australasia (AFPA), a subdivision of Amcor Australasia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">From about 1 July 2000 until 1 October 2004 Mr Hodgson was Group General Manager of AFPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">39 From January to July 2000 Mr Edward Laidlaw was General Manager Sales/Group Marketing Executive of Amcor Australasia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">From August 2000 until September 2002 he was General Manager - Sales and Marketing of AFPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">On 2 September 2002 he was appointed General Manager, Sales - Beverage and Processed Food Packaging of AFPA until 28 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">From 1 March 2003 until 30 November 2004 Mr Laidlaw was Group General Manager, Marketing and Technology of Amcor Australasia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">40 From July to December 2001 Mr Ian Sangster was Regional General Manager, Northern Region of AFPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">From January until December 2002 Mr Sangster was National Marketing Manager for CFP for fresh foods of AFPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He was Acting General Manager, Sales and Marketing of AFPA from December 2002 until August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He then was appointed General Manager Sales and Marketing Australia of Amcor Australasia and remained in this position until October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 6.0 The Over-arching Understanding 
 
 41 Between January and April 2000 Visy and Amcor arrived at the Over-arching Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It contained the following provisions: 
 
 
 (a) Visy and Amcor would permit each other to maintain approximately their then current share of the CFP market;
 (b) Visy and Amcor would not seek to enter into contracts for the supply of CFP with each other's principal CFP customers;
 (c) If, for one reason or another, Visy did enter into a contract for the supply of CFP with a principal CFP customer of Amcor, then Visy would not prevent or seek to prevent Amcor from entering into a supply contract with a customer or customers of Visy in order to replace the share of the CFP market that it had lost as a result of losing the supply contract to Visy;
 (d) The converse would apply when Amcor entered into a contract with a principal CFP customer of Visy;
 (e) Visy and Amcor would, in future, collaborate with each other in order to increase the prices at which they supplied CFP;
 (f) Visy would appoint Mr Carroll as its nominated contact person with Amcor to effect the implementation of the Over-arching Understanding; and
 (g) Amcor would appoint Mr Laidlaw as its nominated contact person with Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
 
 
 42 In these reasons, where there is an account of a conversation, such account is based on the agreed statement of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Unless otherwise indicated, the statement of agreed facts records what was the substance of conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It uses the formula "X said words to the effect that".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It does not purport to be an agreement as to the actual words used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Also it seems unlikely that the term "Over-arching Understanding" was actually used at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">However, the term captures the essence of the understanding which the parties arrived at.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is convenient to use it in this descriptive sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">43 The Over-arching Understanding was arrived at as a result of a series of meetings between Mr Debney and Mr Brown at Mr Brown's home in Glen Iris, Melbourne between January and April 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mr Debney said to Mr Brown that he believed it was not in Visy's interests to continue the price war with Amcor and that Visy intended to increase its CFP prices to more realistic levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He said he wanted the intense competition between Visy and Amcor to cease so that each company could then sell CFP at sustainable price levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">44 Mr Debney proposed that Visy and Amcor would continue to enjoy roughly the current share each had of the CFP market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">They would not poach each other's customers and prices would be increased from their current unsustainable levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Mr Debney said that these proposals were the basic principles which Visy and Amcor should agree to and abide by.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">They should comply with those principles and not take any action which would precipitate a return to price war conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He intended to ensure that Visy abided by these principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">45 Mr Brown said that Amcor would agree to act in accordance with the principles proposed by Mr Debney, subject to Visy also agreeing to so act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr Debney said that Visy would.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">(For the purposes of this proceeding only, Mr Debney agrees with the version of events generally set out in [42]-[44] save and except that he does not agree with the precise chronological sequence of the discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">)
 46 Mr Debney said that he would appoint Mr Carroll to be the Visy nominated contact person between Visy and Amcor on the issues raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Mr Brown said that he would appoint Mr Laidlaw to be the Amcor contact person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">47 In this and other instances of Understandings, the agreed statement of facts says, and I accept, that the Understanding is proved not only by the conversations, but is also to be implied from the conduct which constitutes giving effect to the Understandings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">
 6.1 Giving effect to the Over-arching Understanding 
 
 48 Mr Debney told Mr Carroll that he was Visy's nominated contact person with Amcor and at around the same time Mr Brown told Mr Laidlaw that he was Amcor's nominated contact person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">49 In July 2000 Mr Carroll met with Mr Hodgson and Mr Laidlaw at Rockman's Regency Hotel in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Mr Carroll or Mr Hodgson said to the other that Visy and Amcor had agreed that they would not poach each other's principal CFP customers, that their respective shares of the CFP market would remain at roughly their current levels and each would focus on increasing its prices for CFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">50 Mr Carroll said that he had been appointed as the contact person at Visy with whom Amcor could discuss issues and that Mr Laidlaw should deal with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He said that he would buy Mr Laidlaw a pre-paid mobile phone so that he and Mr Carroll could contact each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Hodgson said to Mr Carroll that Visy and Amcor should agree on minimum floor prices for CFP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Mr Carroll responded that Visy and Amcor should give some thought to the suggestion and talk about it later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">51 Between July 2000 and November 2004 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw met some 30 to 40 times to discuss issues or matters arising from the Over-arching Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">These meetings were held at Rockman's Regency Hotel in Melbourne, the Tudor Motel in Box Hill, the Elizabethan Lodge in Blackburn North, Westerfolds Park on Fitzsimons Lane, Templestowe, the Templestowe Park on Porter Street, Templestowe, the Cherry Hill Tavern in East Doncaster and Myrtle Park on Severn Street, North Balwyn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw also discussed matters arising from the Over-arching Understanding by telephone on numerous occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The telephone discussions were generally initiated from public telephones and received on Mr Carroll's or Mr Laidlaw's mobile telephones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">They had exchanged mobile telephone numbers either at the meeting referred to at [49] --- [50] or soon after.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">(For the purposes of this proceeding only, Mr Carroll agrees with the version of events generally set out in this paragraph, save and except that he does not agree that he and Mr Laidlaw met or spoke on average more than once per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">)
 52 In late 2000 Mr Carroll provided Mr Laidlaw with an Optus pre-paid mobile telephone and the telephone number for it and a new mobile number on which Mr Laidlaw was to contact him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Carroll told Mr Laidlaw he should use the Optus mobile for the purpose of contacting him in relation to the Over-arching Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">53 Between late 2000 and late 2001 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw used their mobile telephones to contact each other to discuss issues arising from the Over-arching Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">54 Later in these reasons there is frequent reference to discussions between Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Those discussions occurred either at the various venues referred to in [51] above or by telephone.</sentence>

<sentence id="s458">In mid-2001 Visy and Amcor arrived at the George Weston Compensation Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">It contained a provision to the effect that Visy would compensate Amcor for the CFP volume Amcor had lost as a result of Visy entering into supply agreements with Inghams and Smith's.</sentence>

<sentence id="s461">211 The George Weston Compensation Understanding was arrived at in discussion between Mr Debney and Mr Brown in June or July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Mr Brown said to Mr Debney that by getting Inghams and Smith's, Visy had recovered more than the volume it had lost as a result of Amcor taking Lion Nathan and Visy would therefore need to compensate Amcor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Mr Debney said to Mr Brown that Visy had recovered more volume from Amcor than it should have and Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw could address this imbalance in their discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">212 Following this discussion, there was a further meeting between Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw in July 2001 in which Mr Carroll said that Visy took Smith's because it wanted Inghams and a second prestigious account as compensation for the loss of the Lion Nathan account, and that Smith's was appropriate and the timing was right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Mr Carroll also said to Mr Laidlaw that he understood that the Inghams and Smith's account jointly represented more than the Lion Nathan account in volume and that he and Mr Laidlaw would need to agree on what Visy customers would be offered to Amcor as compensation for Visy taking that excess volume.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">213 In a series of further discussions between Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw in July and August they each discussed the accounts that Amcor could receive as compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">214 At a further discussion in August Mr Laidlaw said that Amcor would accept the George Weston meat and dairy division account and the OSI (NSW) division account as compensation for Visy taking the Inghams and Smith's accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Mr Carroll said that he would not object and would not react strongly if Amcor took the accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">9.2.2 Giving effect to the George Weston Compensation Understanding 
 215 In the period from September 2001 to March 2002 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw had a discussion in which Mr Carroll told Mr Laidlaw the prices at which Visy proposed to quote for the George Weston meat and dairy division following the expiry of Visy's CFP supply agreement with George Weston on 31 December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">216 On about 8 January 2002 Visy submitted a proposal to George Weston for the continued supply of CFP to George Weston's meat and dairy division at prices above Visy's then current prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">217 On 13 February Visy submitted a revised proposal to George Weston for the continued supply of CFP to George Weston's meat and dairy division at increased prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">The letter offered two options to George Weston.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Option 1 was that existing price levels would increase by 7 per cent effective 1 March 2002 and would remain in place until 31 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Option 2 was that the existing price levels would be increased by 3 per cent effective 1 March 2002 and then by a further 3 per cent effective 1 March 2003 and then remain firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The term of the agreement under Option 2 was to be two years commencing 1 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The Don Smallgoods subdivision of George Weston's meat and dairy division had received a 19 per cent reduction (taking into account a volume rebate, subject to its applicability) from Visy in December 2000 and Visy's prices to George Weston had otherwise been held firm for two years (whereas non-contract customers had received price increases).</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">218 On 25 March Mr Peter Lloyd, National Marketing Manager of Visy, sent an email to Mr Maurice Hibbert of George Weston informing him that Visy wanted to implement the price increases for the continued supply of CFP to George Weston's meat and dairy division with effect from 1 April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">219 On 27 March Mr Lloyd sent an email to Mr Hibbert stating that Visy would increase the prices at which it supplied CFP to George Weston's meat and dairy division with effect from 1 May 2002.</sentence>

<sentence id="s483">224 On or about 15 May 2002 Amcor submitted a revised proposal to George Weston for the supply of the whole of George Weston's CFP requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Amcor's price was based on the use of kraft paper, which is more expensive but stronger and therefore does not require as much paper in terms of weight per metre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Amcor did not need to obtain Visy's prices because George Weston provided Visy's pricing to Amcor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">225 In relation to the prices for CFP proposed by Visy and Amcor, George Weston's representative Mr Hibbert formed a belief in about April or May 2002, on the basis of his review of the proposed prices of Visy and Amcor, that Visy's prices were higher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">226 In about August 2002 Amcor entered into a contract for the supply of the whole of George Weston's CFP requirements.</sentence>

<sentence id="s576">He invited Visy to submit a revised proposal.</sentence>

<sentence id="s578">276 On about 6 February Mr Potter sent to Mr Allen a letter attaching a table purporting to compare Visy's prices for large pizza cartons with those that Potter believed Visy charged Pizza Hut and Domino's for the same product.</sentence>

<sentence id="s592">Mr Carroll said Amcor was seeking to obtain unrealistically high prices from Eagle Boys and would need to lower its prices to finalise the supply agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Mr Laidlaw said that Amcor would consider what Mr Carroll had proposed and try to reach an agreement with Eagle Boys.</sentence>

<sentence id="s605">291 In arriving at the Understandings with Amcor which concerned the fixing of prices, Visy contravened s 45(2)(a)(ii) , as it applies by virtue of s 45A.</sentence>

<sentence id="s607">In arriving at such Understandings, Visy contravened s 45(2)(a)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">By its conduct in applying those Understandings in the case of particular customers, Visy gave effect to the unlawful Understandings and thus contravened s 45(b)(i) and (ii).</sentence>

<sentence id="s619">Decisions of this Court recognise that it is legitimate to avoid double counting where an individual contravenor is an owner of a corporate contravenor: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-777 at [13], Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) (2002) ATPR 41-905 at [27]-[29].</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">I accept this should be so in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">However, Mr Pratt's ownership of Visy has other significance for this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">I shall return to this aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">295 Mr Debney was knowingly concerned in, or a party to, 14 contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">296 Mr Carroll was knowingly concerned in, or a party to, 49 contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">
 13.0 Penalties proposed 
 
 297 The maximum penalties applicable at the time of the contraventions in this case were, in respect of each contravention, $10 million for a corporation and $500,000 for an individual: s 76(1A)(b) and (1B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">In 1993 and 1994 the maximum penalties had been increased to their present level from $250,000 and $50,000 respectively: s 10 of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act 1992 (Cth) and s 46 Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">As from 1 January 2007 the penalties for a corporation may exceed $10 million where the Court can determine the benefit obtained as a result of the contravening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">The maximum penalty is three times the value of that benefit or 10 per cent of annual turnover, whichever is the greater: Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">1) 2006 (Cth), Sch 9 Pt 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">However, these penalties only apply to contraventions committed after 1 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">298 In the case of Visy, the Commission proposes, and Visy does not contest, a penalty of $36 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">It is sufficient to impose one penalty rather than separate penalties for each contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The Commission arrives at the proposed figure as follows: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The single most serious contravention was Visy's arriving at the Over-arching Understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">It should attract a significant penalty, and the Commission submits that a penalty in the vicinity of $7 million is appropriate (in the context of the maximum available penalty being $10 million); 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">The measures subsequently taken by Visy over the relevant period to give effect to the Over-arching Understanding (putting to one side the specific conduct relied upon as constituting the arriving at and giving effect to the 16 sub-understandings admitted by the respondents, addressed in the next three sub-paragraphs) should attract a penalty in the vicinity of $4 million;
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">The four annual Price Increase Understandings (2000 to 2003) were very serious contraventions involving price fixing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">The conduct of Visy in arriving at the 2000 and 2001 Price Increase Understandings on the one hand was, to a certain degree, more serious than its conduct in arriving at the 2002 and 2003 Price Increase Understandings, because the latter understandings were expressly qualified so as to allow each of Visy and Amcor to make "some exceptions [to the implementation of the price increase] of its choosing", whereas the former understandings were not qualified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Visy's contravention in arriving at the 2000 Price Increase Understanding should attract a $2 million penalty, and its contravention in arriving at the 2001 Price Increase Understanding should attract a further $2 million penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">Visy's two contraventions in arriving at the 2002 and 2003 Price Increase Understandings should attract a $1.5 million penalty for each contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">In the case of all four annual Price Increase Understandings, Visy's penalty for giving effect to the understandings should be $1.25 million each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">The total of the penalties which should be imposed in respect of the four annual Price Increase Understandings is therefore in the vicinity of $12 million;
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The Mildura Fruit Co Price Increase Understanding stands outside the contraventions by Visy in relation to the other named customer understandings, as it involves price fixing, and is a more serious set of contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">It should attract a penalty of $2 million, made up of $1 million in respect of arriving at the understanding, and $1 million in respect of giving it effect;
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">The 11 instances of arriving at further understandings in relation to named customers, and giving effect to them, should attract $1 million penalties each, $500,000 being attributable to arriving at the understanding, and $500,000 being attributable to giving effect to the understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Each instance involves a pair of contraventions, independent from the fact that the same conduct constituted giving effect to the Over-arching Understanding;
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">The Over-arching Understanding was largely given effect by Visy arriving at, and giving effect to, the 16 further understandings admitted in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">However, by reason of s 76(3) of the Trade Practices Act , it is not submitted that any further penalties should be attributed to each instance of giving effect to the Over-arching Understanding constituted by the same conduct which constituted the contraventions referred to in the preceding three sub-paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">
 
 
 299 In the case of Mr Debney, the Commission proposes, and he accepts, a total penalty of $1.5 million as follows: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">Arriving at the Over-arching Understanding is in the category of the most serious conduct in the subject of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">A penalty of $400,000 should be imposed;
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Giving effect to the Over-arching Understanding (viewed separately from arriving at the separate understandings) should attract a substantial penalty near the top end of the range: $320,000;
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">His other conduct, arriving at six understandings, should incur a penalty of $130,000 each, totalling $780,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">
 
 
 300 In the case of Mr Carroll, the Commission proposes, and he accepts, a total penalty of $500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">He was a senior Visy executive who had a very substantial role in giving effect to the Over-arching Understanding over almost five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">He was appointed by Mr Debney to have the day to day management of that understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">He was involved in making or giving effect to 15 of the 16 sub-understandings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">301 The Commission accepts that Mr Carroll was appointed to his position by Mr Debney after the latter had arrived at the Over-arching Understanding and at all times he reported to Mr Debney and was acting under his instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">
 14.0 Assessment of penalties 
 
 302 Section 76(1) of the Trade Practices Act provide that the Court may order the payment of such pecuniary penalty as the Court determines to be appropriate " having regard to all relevant matters " including four matters expressly mentioned: 

(i) the nature and extent of the act or omission constituting the contravening conduct;
 
(ii) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravening conduct;
 
(iii) the circumstances in which the act or omission took place; and
 
(iv) whether the contravenor has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">
 303 Decisions of this Court have identified additional relevant factors which can be taken into account (see Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076, at 52,152-52,153; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41-515 at 42,444-42,445): 

(v) the size of the contravening company;
 
(vi) the degree of its power, evidenced by its market share and the ease of entry into the market;
 
(vii) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;
 
(viii) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;
 
(ix) whether the company had a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; 
 
(x) whether the contravenor has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention;
 
(xi) similar conduct in the past;
 
(xii) financial position;
 
(xiii) deterrent effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">
 304 Section 76 imports into the penalty fixing process concepts of moral responsibility long known to the criminal law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">Ordinary sentencing principles apply: Trade Practices Commission v Axive Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41-368 at 42,794, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-628 at 40,891.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">305 The fact that the Commission and the respondents have proffered a penalty agreed as between themselves is relevant, although not of course conclusive, since the responsibility of imposing penalties is conferred by the Trade Practices Act on the Court: see generally Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">
 15.0 Cartel conduct 
 
 306 Cartel behaviour of the kind with which this case is concerned is extremely destructive of the competition on which the prosperity of a free market economy depends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Often the profits can be immense, and the risk of detection slight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Of its nature, cartel behaviour is likely to occur in secret and between parties who seek mutual benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">In the present case, detection occurred purely by chance when Amcor's solicitors, in the course of quite unrelated litigation, stumbled across incriminating material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Even then the present resolution may not have been reached were it not for two additional factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">First, the Commission's immunity policy and, secondly, the fact that there were not only witnesses prepared to give evidence, but also tape recordings of damning conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">307 The progressive increase in the maximum penalties mentioned above shows how gravely the legislature regards this kind of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Price fixing and market sharing are not offences committed by accident, or in a fit of passion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">The law, and the way it is enforced, should convey to those disposed to engage in cartel behaviour that the consequences of discovery are likely to outweigh the benefits, and by a large margin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">308 Critical to any anti-cartel regime is the level of penalty for individual contravenors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">We tend to overlook the fact that corporations are constructs of the law; they only exist and possess rights and liabilities as a consequence of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Heavy penalties are indeed appropriate for corporations, but it is only individuals who can engage in the conduct which enables corporations to fix prices and share markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">309 Many countries with free market economies have recognised this reality by enacting laws which make cartel conduct by individuals subject to criminal sanctions, including imprisonment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">In the United States this happened as long ago as 1890 with the Sherman Act 15 U.S.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">More recently, as shown by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report Hard Core Cartels --- Third Report on the Implementation of the 1988 Recommendation , Paris, 2006, the following countries have laws providing for terms of imprisonment for cartel conduct: Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Norway, Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">310 The Australian Government appointed an expert committee chaired by former High Court Justice Sir Daryl Dawson to report on Australia's competition laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">In April 2003 the Dawson Committee in its report ( Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act ) recommended (Report p 163) that, in the light of submissions made to it and growing overseas experience, criminal sanctions deter serious cartel behaviour and should be introduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">311 On 2 February 2005 the Treasurer, the Honourable Peter Costello MP, announced acceptance of the recommendations of the Dawson Committee and stated that the Government would amend the Trade Practices Act to provide for a term of five years imprisonment, as well as increases in other penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">The Treasurer noted: 
 
 
 Dishonesty goes to the heart of serious cartel conduct, where customers are deceived when purchasing goods or services unaware that the price and supply of those goods and services were determined by collusion, rather than competition .</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">
 


 
 Although, as already mentioned, the Act was amended last year to raise corporate penalties, the Government hasn't yet got around to introducing criminalisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">
 16.0 Visy's conduct 
 
 312 Every day every man, woman and child in Australia would use or consume something that at some stage has been transported in a cardboard box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">The cartel in this case therefore had the potential for the widest possible effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">313 The agreed statement of facts includes the following: 
 
 
 NO ALLEGATION OF LOSS
 374.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">In relation to the conduct of Visy alleged in respect of named customers specified in the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, the ACCC does not allege as part of its case in this proceeding that the conduct, insofar as it is admitted to constitute either making an unlawful arrangement or giving effect to such an arrangement, had any negative financial impact on or caused loss to any of the named customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">
 
 
 314 That statement may be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">The Commission's case sought the imposition of penalties, the making of declarations, the granting of injunctions and other relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">It did not set out to prove that any particular customer of Visy suffered any particular loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">However, that is not to say that the conduct in which Visy engaged was victimless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">The whole point of price fixing and market sharing is to obtain the benefit of prices greater than those which would be obtained in a competitive market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">It must follow that customers pay more than they would in a competitive market, and so suffer loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">The conduct involved here was inherently likely to cause loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">The fact that no particular loss has been alleged in respect of any particular customer cannot alter that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">315 The cartel here went on for almost five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Had it not been accidentally exposed, it would probably still be flourishing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">It was run from the highest level in Visy, a very substantial company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">It was carefully and deliberately concealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">It was operated by men who were fully aware of its seriously unlawful nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">316 It is appropriate to make some allowance for the fact that the respondents have admitted liability and thus saved a great deal of public expense for a trial which could well have lasted six months or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">Traditionally criminal courts are inclined to give less weight to a plea of guilty when it does not result from genuine remorse, repentance or contrition: The Queen v Shannon (1979) 21 SASR 442 at 452-453, Warner, K, Sentencing in Tasmania , 2 nd ed, The Federation Press, 2002, at 3.603.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">Also the weight to be given to an admission of guilt might be less when it comes late, or when it is virtually bowing to the inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">317 I shall say something about remorse in the context of consideration of the individual respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">In the meantime, I note that the principal positive defence pleaded, and maintained until recently, was that any communications between Visy and Amcor were "commercial tactics" against Amcor aimed at "camouflaging" what Visy was doing and a means of obtaining "market intelligence" from its rival (amended defence par 222 (c) and (d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">318 In light of what is now admitted to be the facts, it may be doubted that this John Le Carr&eacute; defence had any prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">Section 45 prohibits contracts, arrangements or understandings containing provisions of a specified kind, whether or not a party harboured a secret intention to cheat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">Moreover, entering into a prohibited contract, arrangement or understanding is a free-standing contravention in itself, whether or not it has been given effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">In any case, a contract, arrangement or understanding can still be given effect even if there is some cheating between the parties (as distinct from cheating the customers, which is the raison d'&ecirc;tre of a cartel) or the cartel does not work as well as some of the parties might have hoped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">319 The corporate culture of Visy in relation to its obligations under the Trade Practices Act was non-existent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">None of the most senior people hesitated for a moment before embarking on obviously unlawful conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">There was in evidence a Visy document entitled "Trade Practices Compliance Manual" dated February 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">It was signed by Mr Pratt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">It bears a distribution list, signed by Mr Debney, with the names of 50 or so personnel covering every State and Head Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">On the front cover it is said: 
 
 
 This is an important document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">It is essential that it be read and understood by you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">Visy Industries requires strict compliance with its policy on the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">
 


 
 The document includes the stern warning that price fixing and market sharing are "strictly prohibited" and that readers of the document "must never make (such) arrangements with a competitor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">Further, it is said Visy personnel 
 
 
 
 should avoid all contact with competitors or their employees other than contact approved by senior management or Visy Industries' Legal Counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">All necessary contact with competitors should be conducted in formal settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">
 
 
 
 I doubt that Westerfolds Park and the Cherry Hill Tavern could be regarded as formal settings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">The Visy Trade Practices Compliance Manual might have been written in Sanskrit for all the notice anybody took of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">320 Parity with penalties imposed in other cases is a relevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">Counsel referred to a number of other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">I do not think it necessary to analyse these in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Ultimately each case turns on its own facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Suffice it to say that the penalty proposed is more than twice the highest previous penalty imposed by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">That is reflective of the fact that this must be, by far, the most serious cartel case to come before the Court in the 30 plus years in which price fixing has been prohibited by statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">321 The penalty of $36 million proposed for Visy is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">I accept the analysis by which the Commission has arrived at this figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">
 17.0 Mr Pratt's conduct 
 
 322 Visy, Mr Pratt, Mr Debney and Mr Carroll through their counsel accepted responsibility for their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">They expressed contrition, accepted the serious nature of the contraventions and accepted that they warranted a very substantial penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">They apologised for their conduct, regretted the circumstances which had occurred and repented their contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">They accepted that they stepped "well over the line of the boundaries prescribed by the Act".</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">However, contrition here probably has a substantial element of regret at being found out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">323 While Mr Pratt's conduct, as revealed in the statement of agreed facts, was limited to the one meeting with the Amcor CEO at the All Nations Hotel, that was of major importance to the operation of the cartel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">It would not be expected that somebody in his position would get involved in the day to day running of the cartel, like Mr Debney or, to a greater extent, Mr Carroll.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Yet he gave his personal sanction to this obviously unlawful arrangement and an assurance of its continued operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">It would not have continued without his approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">324 In a public statement which went out to Visy staff and customers over Mr Pratt's name as Chairman of the Visy Group on 8 October, and after it had become public knowledge that the respondents would admit liability, it was said: 
 
 
 Visy takes its obligations under the TPA very seriously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">The company deeply regrets what happened and its poor appreciation of the complexities and application of the various provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">
 
 
 

Later in the statement it is said:
 
 
 Visy's actions were motivated by a desire to take advantage of our competitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">
 


 
 This appears to be an attempt to revive Visy's defence which, for the reasons already stated, I think to be quite without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">In any case, the statement is hardly consistent with a frank admission of wrongdoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">325 More importantly, there is nothing complex about the law that prohibits price fixing and market sharing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">Mr Debney and Mr Carroll certainly knew about this law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">That is why they met with their competitor in parks and suburban hotels and used pre-paid mobile phones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">There cannot be any doubt that Mr Pratt also knew that the cartel, to which he gave his approval, and in which he has admitted to being knowingly concerned, was seriously unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">326 There is also the factor that the cartel was to operate for Mr Pratt's personal benefit, via his ownership, or part ownership, of Visy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">This was not the case of an employee acting out of some misguided sense of corporate loyalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">
 18.0 Mr Debney's conduct 
 
 327 Mr Debney was a joint instigator of the cartel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">He personally directed his subordinate, Mr Carroll, to operate it (to Mr Carroll's great cost, apart from anything else).</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">From time to time Mr Debney personally participated in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">He was the senior officer of a large company operating in a market which affects the whole community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">His conduct showed no regard for the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">328 The proposed penalty of $1.5 million is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">329 I was informed that Mr Debney's (and Mr Carroll's) penalties will be borne by a Visy entity or a related entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">Such indemnities are now unlawful by virtue of ss 77A and 77B of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">These sections were introduced by the 2006 amendments following recommendations in the Dawson Committee Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">They only apply to contraventions committed after 1 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">330 However, s 199A(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), effective from 1 July 2004, provides: 
 
 
 (2) A company or a related body corporate must not indemnify a person (whether by agreement or by making a payment and whether directly or through an interposed entity) against any of the following liabilities incurred as an officer or auditor of the company: 
 
 
 (a) a liability owed to the company or a related body corporate; 
 (b) a liability for a pecuniary penalty order under section 1317G or a compensation order under section 1317H or 1317HA ; 
 (c) a liability that is owed to someone other than the company or a related body corporate and did not arise out of conduct in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">
 
 This subsection does not apply to a liability for legal costs .</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">
 
 331 Paragraph (a) would not be applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Paragraph (b) is concerned with pecuniary penalties payable under the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">However par (c) would seem to apply to a liability to pay a pecuniary penalty to "someone other than the company" (ie the Commonwealth) under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Unlawful cartel conduct would not be "conduct in good faith".</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">The section would seem to apply to the time when the indemnity is given and not to the time of the underlying conduct which gave rise to the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Anyway, Visy and any other related corporate entity will have to satisfy themselves that any indemnity to Messrs Debney and Carroll is lawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">
 19.0 Mr Carroll's conduct 
 
 332 Although he committed the largest number of contraventions, Mr Carroll's conduct, because of his lower position in the company and the fact that he was not an instigator, is less blameworthy than Mr Pratt's or Mr Debney's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">Nevertheless, he engaged over a long period in knowingly unlawful conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">The proposed penalty of $500,000 is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">
 20.0 Other orders 
 
 333 There will be declarations as to the contraventions, injunctions, an order for a trade practices compliance program and an order that the respondents pay the costs of the Commission of and incidental to this proceeding.</sentence>
