1 This is an appeal from a decision of Lloyd-Jones FM of 2 March 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 4 May 2005 and handed down on 26 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The appellant is a citizen of Fiji of Indian ethnicity who last arrived in Australia on 5 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 22 September 2004, he lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 24 September 2004, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant him a Protection Visa, and, on 21 October 2004, he applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The Tribunal, under the heading, "Findings and Reasons" said: 
 
 The essence of the Applicant's claim for refugee status is that he has a well-founded fear of persecution inFiji because of his Indian ethnicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 As I advised the Applicant during the course of the Tribunal hearing held on 23 February 2005, although I accept that like many other Fijian Indians, he had been robbed, assaulted, beaten, abused, and badly treated by native Fijians between the years 1987 (after the first coup) and early 2003, on his own evidence to the Tribunal, there have been no incidents of note for the past 2 years; he did not apply for a Protection Visa when he was in Australia in September 2003; and independent country information indicates that the situation in Fiji had been stable for the last couple of years and a state of lawlessness no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 
 In the light of the foregoing, as well as the evidence given by the Applicant to the Tribunal that his younger siblings continue to live with his parents at the same address (close to Lautoka) at which the Applicant had lived all his life before his departure to Australia; that neither he nor any member of his family had relocated to another part of Fiji; that no other members of his family have ever left Fiji; and that he had not departed Fiji when (a) he first obtained a Fiji passport in 1998, or (b) applied for refugee status when the opportunity arose when he first visited Australia for 3 weeks in September/October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Although I note the Applicant's explanations for his and his family's failure to re-locate to another part of Fiji, I do not accept these as satisfactory, and they indicate to me that neither the Applicant nor his family genuinely fear persecution in Lautoka or genuinely believe that they are at real risk of persecution because of their ethnicity in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">
 
 After careful examination of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention-related reason in Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 (Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">

4 The grounds of that amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court included the allegation that the appellant was a refugee within the meaning of the Convention, and particulars of that claim included the following: 
 
 
 
 c. The applicant applied for a protection visa on the grounds of persecution because of his race and religion --- areas covered under the definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 d. The Tribunal erred in not considering the applicant's claims because it failed to take into account the precise nature of the applicant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 

5 One of the grounds of his application to the Federal Magistrates Court alleged that:
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">...the transcript of the hearing will show that the Tribunal did not address any specific Convention related issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The applicant had lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in the first instance; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Tribunal persisted in asking why the applicant had not applied for a protection visa when he visited Australia in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In pursuing this line of questinoing the Tribunal displayed bias by not accepting the applicant's explanation provided with evidence that showed that in 2003 he had paid a substantial sum of money to a migration agent to lodge a student visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This was a crucial answer that the Tribunal did not take into consideration and in not considering the reasons given by the applicant, denied the applicant any real chance of presenting substantive rational reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 c. The Tribunal erroneously reached the conclusion that because the applicant had not applied for a protection visa in 2003 meant that the applicant was not at risk of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
 
 
 

6 And a further ground:
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicant's submissions to the Tribunal contained detailed accounts of the serious harm he had suffered; details that the Tribunal refused to take into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">By refusing to even take the claims into consideration the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The persecution which the applicant feared was for one or more of the reasons enumerated in the Convention definition --- race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant came within the definition under race, political opinion and religion, yet the Tribunal did not apply the definition to the applicant's case and in doing so refused to take the applicant's case into consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">... 
 (Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">

7 During the course of the oral hearing before the Tribunal, the appellant produced his passport and driving licence to the Tribunal Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Tribunal asked: 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">You didn't apply for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">You applied for a student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 A. Yeah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 

8 He was asked:
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">You had a passport since 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 
 
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Why didn't you leave Fiji before you did?</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I did .. (not transcribable) .. 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 
 

9 And later:
 
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">... you lodged application for a student visa two days before you left --- and you had been here a month and you didn't apply for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">This is what this is about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 

10 The reaons of the Federal Magistrate set out completely the amended application of the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court, parts of which I have earlier set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">That application was a very detailed application, of more than nine pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">11 The Federal Magistrate in his reasons said: 
 
 
 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Mr Leerdam [Counsel for the Minister] submits that the applicant has not specifically identified what claims the Tribunal did not consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal accepted that the applicant may have been harmed in the past, but found that it did not consider there to be a real chance of persecution in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">There was no need for the Tribunal to identify every claim in relation to past harm which it accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 

12 Later, the Federal Magistrate said: 
 
 
 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The applicant claims that the Tribunal denied him procedural fairness in not determining his claims under the definition of race, politics, and membership of a particular social group .</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Further that the Tribunal had a predetermined conclusion about his case and failed to address definitions under the Convention and his specific claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The applicant submits that these are matters fundamental to the function of the Tribunal under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">By displaying such procedural unfairness, the Tribunal failed to properly determine the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicant questions how the Tribunal could have reached a conclusion without addressing the claims under race, politics and particular social group, which went to the heart of the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 (Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

13 Concerning the claim of persecution because of membership of a particular social group, the Federal Magistrate said:
 
 
 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The applicant submits that he constitutes a particular social group against which the finding of protection ought to have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The applicant submits that he belongs to a particular group of Indo-Fijians who are perceived to be wealthy land owners, which puts them in a vulnerable position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 The applicant contends that by failing to identify this vulnerable group, it is unlikely that the Tribunal would then make a finding of effective state protection for this group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The applicant contends that aspects of harassment and risk of this social group were not considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 
 
 
 
 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr Leerdam submits the applicant's claims were not that he belonged to a particular social group, but that he feared indigenous Fijians because of his Indian ethnicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The applicant also did not claim that he was targeted because he was perceived to be a wealthy land owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The particular social group now claimed by the applicant was therefore not raised before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
 

14 The conclusion of the Federal Magistrate was:
 
 
 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The applicant appeared as a self-represented litigant, however his amended application and submissions had been prepared by Mr Kumar of counsel, who regularly appears in this jurisdiction but withdrew before the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The applicant did not appear to understand the nature of his application or the contents of the documents which were prepared and filed on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He declined to make oral submissions and said he would rely on the documents filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Although there was a considerable volume of material filed for the applicant, their contents were formulaic, vague and in many particulars, repetitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 
 
 
 
 
 37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Mr Leerdam, appearing for the respondents, assisted the Court by addressing the relevant points that arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I am satisfied that none of the gounds raised alleging jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal can be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Consequently, the application should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 
 
 

15 I note that Mr Kumar, who appeared for the appellant on this appeal, said from the Bar Table that the statement in the first sentence in [36] of the Federal Magistrate's reasons was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Whether that statement was correct is irrelevant to the disposition of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">16 The first ground of appeal to this Court is that there was a failure by the Tribunal to consider all of the applicant's claims to warrant protection pursuant to the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In particular, his claim was not limited to his ethnicity (Indo-Fijian).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">His claim also clearly regarded his involvement in politics with the Fiji Labor Party, and asserted a fear of persecution for political or imputed political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">17 It was submitted for the appellant that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal (which are set out above) clearly show that the Tribunal's consideration of the persecution claimed by the appellant was limited to ethnicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There was no consideration concerning the claim of persecution for the reason of political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">18 A further submission is that the Tribunal failed to consider his claim that he was at risk of persecution as a consequence of his membership of a particular social group, being that sub-group of Indo-Fijians who are lessors of Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">19 His original application had contained the statement: 
 
 During this initial attack we were warned by these Fijians that sooner or later they were going to repossess their land and that they should start making plans to 'go back to India'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I was quite badly hurt in this encounter ... 
 

20 The claim is that the Tribunal considered only the ethnicity of the applicant, failed to consider these other claims, and merely relied on general country information regarding "the situation in Fiji".</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">21 It was submitted by Mr Godwin, Counsel for the Minister, that while the Tribunal characterised the "essence" of the appellant's fears as being founded on his Indian ethnicity, this did not mean the Tribunal was excluding from consideration the other bases he gave for his fears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">22 Counsel submitted:
 
 The conclusion of the RRT was based upon the actions of the appellant and his family which the RRT considered were inconsistent with actions of persons fearing persecution in the area where they lived (Lautoka).</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">This conclusion applied to persecution for whatever reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 

23 In NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1, the Full Court (Black CJ, French, and Selway JJ) said at [60]:
 
 In SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17], Selway referred to the observation by Kirby J in Dranichnikov , at 405, that "[t]he function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">He also referred to the observation by von Doussa J in SCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 548 that "[n]either the delegate nor the Tribunal is obliged to consider claims that have not been made" (at [16]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Selway J however went on to observe in SGBB (at [17]): 
 
 
 
 'But this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19 th Century pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">' 
 
 
 
 His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: 
 
 
 
 'The Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">An asylum claimant does not have to pick the correct Convention "label" to describe his or her plight, but the Tribunal can only deal with the claims actually made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">' 
 
 
 
 His Honour, in our view, correctly stated the position when he said at (at [18]): 
 
 
 
 'The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">' 
 
 
 

24 The Full Court further said, at [63]:
 
 It is plain enough, in the light of Dranichnikov, that a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which, if resolved in one way, would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act and thereby a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It follows that if the Tribunal makes an error of fact in misunderstanding or misconstruing a claim advanced by the applicant and bases its conclusion in whole or in part upon the claim so misunderstood or misconstrued its error is tantamount to a failure to consider the claim and on that basis can constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The same may be true if a claim is raised by the evidence, albeit not expressly by the applicant, and is misunderstood or misconstrued by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Every case must be considered according to its own circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Error of fact, although amounting to misconstruction of an applicant's claim, may be of no consequence to the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It may be "subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which [the] contention rests which has been rejected": Applicant WAEE [ WAEE v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 184] (at [47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">But as the Full Court said in WAEE (at [45]): 
 
 
 
 If the tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 to conduct a review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">This is a matter of substance, not a matter of the form of the tribunal's published reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 

25 In WAEE , the Full Court said, at [47]:
 
 The inference that the tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 

26 It may be, as Counsel for the Minister submitted, that the findings and reasons were, and were meant to be, applicable to all of the bases which the appellant had advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">27 The fact remains, however, that there is an express and confining reference to ethnicity, both at the start and end of the Tribunal's "Findings and Reasons".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">28 It may very well be that the reasons which the Tribunal gave for declining the appellant's ethnicity as the foundation of an entitlement to be recognised as a refugee would also apply to the alternative bases advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Tribunal did not say so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">29 In my judgment, there has been a failure to conduct the review required by the Act, and thereby the Tribunal erred in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I do not think that the findings of the Tribunal, expressly addressing the ethnicity claim, can be read as of general application to the other claims advanced by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">These other claims were not expressly addressed by the Tribunal in its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">30 The appellant advanced a further ground seeking to impugn the decision of the Tribunal and consequently the decision of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">31 It was submitted that the Tribunal had used information contained from a "passenger movement" file in the departmental file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It was said that the finding as to the applicant's credibility and the reliance on an earlier trip in 2003 was "part of the decision", and pursuant to s 424A of the Act, the Tribunal was obliged to give notice to the applicant particulars of that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">32 It is plain from the passages of the transcript of the hearing earlier set out in these reasons that the Tribunal, in its oral hearing, made it plain to the appellant that the information about the time that he has had his passport, and his earlier visits to Australia, were relevant to its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">There was, on the material before the Court, no breach of s 424A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">33 However, for the reason that the Tribunal failed to accord to the appellant the hearing and determination to which he was entitled, namely a proper consideration of the grounds on which he claimed to be a refugee, the appeal must be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">34 The orders of the Court are: Orders 2 and 3 of the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court of 2 March 2007 be set aside, and there be no order as to the costs before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">35 The decision of the Tribunal is set aside and the matter remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal to be dealt with according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">36 The first respondent is ordered to pay the appellant's costs of and incidental to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.</sentence>
