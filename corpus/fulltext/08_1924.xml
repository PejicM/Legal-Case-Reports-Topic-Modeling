1 This appeal is one of those rare cases, where the call for compassion stretches almost to breaking point the obligation to be faithful to the judicial oath to do justice according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 If there was a basis, any basis, on which I could allow this appeal while maintaining fidelity to that judicial obligation, I would.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It grieves me to say that I have been unable to find such a basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 The appellant (whose pseudonym is SZMKY) is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who arrived in Australia in September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She was born on 27 August 1964.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 25 October 2007, she lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa with the Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 23 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 25 February 2008, the appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In a decision made on 4 May 2008 and handed down on 22 May 2008, the Tribunal dismissed the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court on 20 June 2006, where she was unrepresented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Federal Magistrate Scarlett, in a judgment given ex tempore on 11 September 2008, dismissed the appellant's appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court: see SZMKY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 1338.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 The appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court on 2 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Background to the Application 
 
6 The appellant claimed, in her application for a protection visa and before the Tribunal, that she had been persecuted because of her violation of the "one-child" policy in force in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">She married her husband in 1988, and they had a child together in 1991, a daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Her husband wished to have a son, however, and she became pregnant again in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Because a second birth was not permitted pursuant to the one-child policy, she had to hide in the homes of others to avoid officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">She said that she had been discovered in her seventh month of pregnancy by birth control officials and was detained and forced to have an abortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Thereafter, she said that her house had been confiscated, that she had lost her employment, and, as a consequence of the forced abortion, her husband divorced her in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">She also claimed that the electricity and water supply were cut off to her home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 The delegate of the Minister, in refusing the appellant a protection visa, said:
 All of the above considerations suggest that, while the applicant was subjected to persecutory treatment by local birth control officials in 2002, she was not subjected to any further harm between 2002 and 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Furthermore, I am mindful that evidence of past persecution does not give rise to a presumption that the applicant's fear of persecution on return to their country of origin is well-founded (MIEA v Guo Wei Rong &amp; Anor [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559) , and that the assessment of an applicant's claims requires a decision-maker to determine whether their fear of persecution is well-founded in the reasonably foreseeable future (NAHI v MIMA [2004] FCAFC 10).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There is no evidence to suggest that, on her return to the PRC, the applicant would be subjected to any continuing punitive action on account of her pregnancy in 2002, and she does not state that she has any intention or desire to have any further children in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">(Emphasis in original) 
8 It is clear from the reasons of the Tribunal that it was sensitive to the sad history of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In [19] of its reasons, the Tribunal said:
 I explained to the applicant that I had to try to understand why these things had happened to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I noted that she had said that she had breached the planned birth policy and I indicated to her that if what had happened to her was the result of the application of that policy, and it had been applied to her in the same way as it would have been to anyone else in China in the same situation, that would not bring her within the definition of a refugee because the Refugees Convention required that an applicant fear being persecuted for one or more of the five Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I explained to the applicant that in asking whether she had been treated differently from anyone else who might have breached the one child policy I was therefore trying to find out whether she had been treated differently for one of the five Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 Later, the Tribunal said, at [23]:
 I noted that, as we had discussed, the Refugees Convention required that the applicant fear persecution for one of the five Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">She had told me that she believed that she had been treated differently from other people who had breached the planned birth policy but she had said that she could not tell me why she had been treated differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I put to her that it would be difficult for me to find, on the basis of the evidence she had given at the hearing, that she had been singled out or treated differently for one of the five Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I put to the applicant that if I did not accept that she had been singled out or treated differently for one of the five Convention reasons then I might conclude that she had simply been punished for her breach of the planned birth policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 And later, at [24]:
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I noted that the applicant had said that she did not want to return to China because it was a sad place for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The applicant said that she wished that I could give her an opportunity to stay in Australia permanently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">She said that she had lost her family in China: she had nothing there at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 At [26], the Tribunal said:
 The applicant referred to the fact that she had had an induced abortion and that she had been hospitalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">She said that she had been returned to her home before she had fully recovered and the relationship between her and her husband had worsened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">She said that all the time her husband had been hoping she could give birth to a boy but she had lost her baby and her husband had deserted her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The applicant repeated that she hoped that I could give her a chance to stay here because she did not want to return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">She said that she had been persecuted so badly in China that she had wanted to die.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">She said that the only thing that had stopped her had been the need to look after her daughter, to raise her and to educate her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">She said that Australia was a very nice place where people even received benefits for giving birth to children but you could not do that in China: you would be fined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">12 The Tribunal said, at [28]:
 I consider that the applicant was commendably honest in her evidence at the hearing before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">I accept that when she became pregnant with her second child she was forced to undergo an abortion and that her husband subsequently divorced her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I accept that she does not want to return to China because it is a sad place for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">However, although the applicant said that she believed that she had been treated more harshly than others who had breached the 'one child' policy in China --- in that others had merely been fined whereas she had been forced to undergo an abortion and shut up in a dark room --- she said that she did not know why she had been treated more harshly than other people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">She said that it was just the way of the country that they did not treat everybody alike.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">She said that she had not had problems with the authorities before that: she had just been a common citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">13 The Tribunal continued, at [29]:
 Moreover, although I accept that the applicant was laid off by her employer because she had breached the 'one child' policy, she was employed from 2005 until she left China in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Likewise, although she said that her house had been confiscated, as I put to her in the course of the hearing before me, she said that she had been living at a particular address in China before she left China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">As I explained to her in the course of the hearing before me, the definition of a refugee looks to the future and, while I accept that the applicant has been badly persecuted in the past, and that she does not want to return to China because it is a sad place for her, she has not pointed to any harm which would amount to persecution which she fears she will suffer for one or more of the five Convention reasons if she returns to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">14 The application to the Federal Magistrates Court was based on two grounds of appeal: 
 
 
 (1) the Tribunal failed to invite her to comment on adverse information in breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act); 
 (2) the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by applying a wrong test of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal accepted that she had been mistreated because of her breach of the [one-child] policy; the Tribunal was wrong to find that this mistreatment had not been for a reason connected to the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 

15 The appellant also put before Scarlett FM compassionate grounds for allowing her to stay, including certain medical reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">His Honour indicated that the Court did not have jurisdiction to issue any visa for such reasons, the Court's role being limited to judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Scarlett FM said any compassionate grounds must be made to the Minister following the finalisation of the proceedings, if they were not favourable to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">16 Scarlett FM rejected the claim made in reliance on s 424A of the Act, indicating that the Senior Member constituting the Tribunal had elected to comply with s 424AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">After reviewing the Senior Member's decision, particularly [23] --- [26], part of which I have set out above, his Honour held that the Member had clearly set out items of information that would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">His Honour held that the information would be covered, in any event, by s 424AA(3) , but, further, the applicant had been given extra time to comment on or respond to the information if she wished, but she had declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In Scarlett FM's view, the Member had complied with s 424AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">17 Scarlett FM held that the second ground advanced, namely, that the Tribunal had applied the wrong test for persecution, was "really a challenge to the Tribunal's factual findings".</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Tribunal had in fact found that the applicant's claims had no Convention nexus, and therefore, the applicant could not be classified as a person to whom Australia owed obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">18 Scarlett FM concluded, at [43] of his Honour's reasons:
 The Court's jurisdiction is confined to a consideration as to whether the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As the Applicant's second ground is, in effect, a challenge to the Tribunal's factual finding, it amounts to what is known as a "merits review" or an "attempted merits review" which, unfortunately for the Applicant, is not open to a Court conducting judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">19 Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">20 It seems to me that the Federal Magistrate did not consider the question raised by the applicant in her second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The complaint by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court concerned the characterisation of the persecution which the Senior Member constituting the Tribunal considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Scarlett FM did not review the correctness of the test which the Tribunal had propounded and had applied, and did not dismiss the appellant's appeal on the basis that the test the Tribunal applied was the correct test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Rather, he considered that the appellant was attacking only factual findings on persecution and dismissed the claim as merits review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">21 While, in my view, the Federal Magistrate was in error in this approach, a careful examination of the reasons of the Tribunal indicates that the Member was at pains to set out exactly the test he was using in coming to his conclusion that the persecution which the appellant fears she will suffer if she were to return to China was not for one or more of the five Convention reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">22 The appellant told this Court that if she was returned to China, she could have a further child only at the real risk of a further forced abortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The real question is whether the Tribunal was obliged to conclude that fear of a forced abortion for breach of China's one-child policy constituted a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, and that in failing so to conclude erred in the exercise of its jurisdiction by applying the wrong test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">23 The High Court (Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ, with Brennan CJ and Kirby J dissenting) in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ( Applicant A ) held that such fear would not constitute persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">24 In Applicant A , the Tribunal had accepted as a matter of fact that coercive measures were used in the implementation of China's family planning policy, and that coercive measures ranged from forms of civil discrimination to fines and forced contraception, sterilisation and abortion: see at 251.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Tribunal defined the social group in question as " those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised .</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">" 
 
25 The majority in the High Court held that persons who oppose China's one child policy and feared sterilisation did not constitute a "particular social group", because the uniting feature was a fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">26 Dawson J said in his reasons, at 243:
 In this case, the reason the appellants fear persecution is not that they belong to any group, since there is no evidence that being the parents of one child and not accepting the limitations imposed by government policy is a characteristic which, because it is shared with others, unites a collection of persons and sets them apart from society at large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It is not an accurate response to say that the government itself perceives such persons to be a group and persecutes individuals because they belong to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Rather, the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that, by their actions, they have brought themselves within its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">For the reasons I have given, that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">27 McHugh J said, at 269-270:
 If, as is probably the case, the Tribunal meant by "those who ... do not accept the limitations placed on them" those couples who believe that they should be able to have more than one child notwithstanding the government's policy, there is nothing to link the couples so as to create a perception that they constitute a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">There is simply a disparate collection of couples throughout China who want to have more than one child contrary to the one child policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Some may wish to have a child as soon as possible; some in the near future; and others in the distant future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There is no social attribute or characteristic linking the couples, nothing external that would allow them to be perceived as a particular social group for Convention purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">To classify such couples as "a particular social group" is to create an artificial construct that bears no resemblance to a social group as that term is ordinarily understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">28 And Gummow J said, at 285:
 I would assume, for the purposes of the determination of this appeal, that the PRC has a "one child policy", infringement of which attracts, as a matter of governmental decision, the sanctions feared by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I assume therefore that there exists a policy which is being implemented in a fashion which engulfs a number of persons for whom the PRC is their country of nationality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">On that footing, a disparate collection of parents, and those desiring to be parents, who do not accept and have difficulties in complying with a "one child policy" are at risk of the application of a general law of conduct required by the state and, on the assumptions I have made, brutally enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">But they are not members of a particular social group with a fear of persecution by reason of membership thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">29 The only distinguishing feature between Applicant A and the present case is the form of persecution feared, namely, the appellant in the present case fears compulsory abortion as opposed to compulsory sterilisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">30 Gummow J said, at 286, that " ... the form the persecution takes should not 'be inserted into the definition of the social group .</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">'"
 
31 Consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Applicant A , the Tribunal, while accepting that "the applicant has been badly persecuted in the past", concluded that the appellant had not pointed to any harm which would amount to persecution which she fears she will suffer for one or more of the five Convention reasons if she returns to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">32 Similarly, before the Federal Magistrates Court, Scarlett FM records, in [29] of his Honour's reasons:
 Counsel for the Minister, Ms Sirtes, submitted that the Applicant, whilst she had made quite clear that she did not wish to return to China, had not demonstrated any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal and submitted that the Applicant's unfortunate circumstances did not provide any ground for remitting her application to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">33 Scarlett FM held that Ground 2 of the appellant's appeal was " ... really a challenge to the Tribunal's factual findings ", and therefore no case of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal had been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">34 This is not a challenge to a factual finding by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal held, however, that mistreatment amounting to persecution for breach of the "one child" policy was not persecution because of membership of "a particular social group", and therefore the appellant did not fall within the definition of a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">35 The legal position is plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The appeal to this Court from the Federal Magistrates Court has to be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">36 I note that, given the various matters set out above, it is possible for the appellant to apply to the Minister pursuant to s 417 of the Migration Act for the exercise of the Minister's personal discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.</sentence>
