<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This proceeding concerns a claimant application for the determination of native title in respect of a large area of west and south-west New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application was filed on 8 October 1997 with the National Native Title Tribunal ('the NNTT') by Dorothy and Phillip Lawson ('the Lawsons') on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) people ('the Claim Group').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The progress of the application has been hindered by a number of disputes within the Claim Group including, inter alia, disputes about which members of the Claim Group should represent it as the applicant in this proceeding and about the area that should be the subject of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 On 13 July 2001, I rejected an application made under s 66B to remove the Lawsons as the applicant: Johnson, in the matter of Lawson v Lawson [2001] FCA 894.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Although I accepted that the Lawsons had lost the confidence of some important members of the Claim Group I was not satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to show that the Claim Group, by appropriate decision-making processes, had revoked their authority to represent it or had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 Following unsuccessful attempts to mediate the issues within the Claim Group, a further application to replace the Lawsons was successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 9 December 2002, I ordered that Ray Lawson, Noel Johnson, Mary-Ann Marton, Jennifer Whyman and Patricia Johnson replace the Lawsons as the applicant: Lawson on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 (' Lawson ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 29 September 2004, the application was amended to add William Bates, Maureen O'Donnell and Cyril Hunter to the group comprising the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">These eight individuals presently comprise the applicant in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 On 23 December 2004, the NNTT refused to accept the amended application for registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Subsequently, a dispute about the future conduct of the proceeding arose between Ray Lawson and Noel Johnson and the other members of the applicant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In essence, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson believe that the area subject to the claim should be split between two claims, those of the people they regard as 'pure' Barkandji people and those of the other members of the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The notice of motion 
 
5 Attempts to resolve the dispute referred to above have been unsuccessful and, pursuant to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Claim Group on 1 October 2005, culminated in the filing of a notice of motion on 14 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">By this notice of motion, an amended version of which was filed in Court on 13 December 2005, members of the Claim Group seek an order under s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NTA') replacing the current applicant on grounds that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In effect the motion seeks: (a) to remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group as well as a third member, Mrs Patricia Johnson; and (b) to add two new members, Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson oppose the application to remove them; Mrs Johnson has not appeared or made any submissions however it is alleged that, because of her ill health, she no longer wishes to be part of the group that comprises the applicant or to be involved in the management of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Application for representation by a non-lawyer 
 
6 On 30 November 2005, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson applied for leave to be represented by Mr Mark Dengate who is neither a barrister nor a solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">At the directions hearing on 5 December, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson appeared by telephone to press this application as did Mr Dengate, who currently has leave to appear in a related compensation matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 In support of their application for leave to be represented by a non-lawyer, Messrs Lawson and Johnson contended that Mr Dengate understood their position and was willing to assist them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It was evident from their statements that they have a degree of confidence in Mr Dengate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">For his part, Mr Dengate referred to the fact that neither Mr Lawson nor Mr Johnson could read or write sufficiently to cope with representing themselves and that without his assistance they would have no representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He submitted that he has experience in these matters and is in a position to assist the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 Section 85 of the NTA provides that a 'party may appear in person or may be represented by a barrister, a solicitor or, with the leave of the Federal Court, another person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Although Messrs Lawson and Johnson are members of the applicant group they are not, as individuals, parties to this proceeding: see s 61(2) of the NTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Nevertheless they are, effectively, the contradictors to the present motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I am satisfied, therefore, that under the Court's power to do that which is incidental or necessary to the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in this case by s 66B of the NTA, I have jurisdiction to entertain the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In Melaleuca of Australia &amp; New Zealand Pty Ltd v Duck [2005] FCA 1481 , Bennett J helpfully summarised the Court's 'inherent' power in this regard at [5]-[15].</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">While I would prefer to take the approach advocated in Parsons v Martin (1984) 5 FCR 235 at 241 and refer to this power as an 'incidental and necessary power of a statutory court' rather than as 'inherent', I respectfully accept her Honour's statement of the generally applicable principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">9 In particular, I see no reason why the Court's incidental power to grant a person leave to appear by a non-lawyer and the power to do so under s 85 of the NTA should not involve similar considerations, particularly in the current context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 871 , Lindgren J stated at [20] in relation to an application for leave under s 85: 
 
 'What should be clearly understood is that leave is required because it is not to be taken for granted that a person who is not a solicitor or barrister will be allowed to represent a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Perhaps Dolly Walker thinks that leave is granted as a matter of course, just for the asking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This is not so and for good reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Solicitors and barristers are qualified by education and training to represent parties and are subject to professional and curial disciplines and responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The requirement of leave is imposed for the reason that the Court must be satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice in all the circumstances that a party be represented by a person who is not a solicitor or barrister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">' 

See also, Adnyamathanha People No 1 v South Australia (2004) 208 ALR 91 at [9] et seq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 In opposing the application for leave for Mr Dengate to appear, Ms Phillips, who appeared for New South Wales Native Title Services ('NTS'), pointed out that the application for leave (which was signed by Mr Dengate) sought to have him represent Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson not only in respect of the present motion but also in the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The notion that there is any scope for members of the applicant group to be separately represented fundamentally misconceives the role of those comprising an applicant in native title proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">As I pointed out in Johnson on behalf of the Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 981 (' Johnson ') at [8]:
 
 'Such applicants are representatives of the claimant group; they have no personal interest other than as members of the claimant group and for this reason their interests do not differ from each other or from the claimant group and separate representation is inappropriate and unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">' 

11 I am satisfied that, in the present circumstances, it is not in the interests of justice for Mr Dengate to be permitted to represent Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">With the greatest respect to Mr Dengate, and despite his genuine commitment to his clients, I am convinced that he has neither the discipline nor the understanding to assist them or the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I am confirmed in this view by my previous experience of Mr Dengate as an advocate; see my comments in Johnson at [14]-[16] and Johnson on behalf of the Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2003] FCA 1411 at [4] - [6] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">For these reasons I declined to grant leave for Mr Dengate to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">12 It is also relevant to note that Messrs Lawson and Johnson have some experience in native title proceedings in this Court and, as it transpired, their evidence and submissions at the motion hearing were cogent, relevant and explained the dispute between the parties clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Objection to proposed date for hearing of the notice of motion 
 
13 A further issue was raised at the directions hearing of 5 December 2005 in relation to the suitability or otherwise of the proposed hearing date; 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Dengate contended that there had been delays in the service of the documents relating to the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He stated that Mr Lawson had not been served with all the documents until 21 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Consequently, he argued that it was not appropriate to hear the motion on 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">14 Ms Phillips conceded that there was some delay in formally serving all the material on Messrs Lawson and Johnson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">However, she contended, and the evidence supports her contention, that they had been on notice of the motion seeking to replace them as part of the group comprising the applicant since early October.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In particular, she referred to correspondence dated 7 October 2005 from NTS to both Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson advising them that the 1 October meeting had resolved to invite them to resign from the applicant group and had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is plain that this correspondence was received as by letter dated 11 October 2005 a solicitor wrote on their behalf to NTS indicating that they did not intend to resign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">15 Following this refusal, NTS moved to replace them under s 66B of the NTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Neither Mr Lawson nor Mr Johnson attended the directions hearing of 14 October 2005 at which the motion seeking orders under s 66B was filed and a timetable put in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In these circumstances I was satisfied that the hearing date of 13 December 2005 should be retained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 It is also relevant to note that following the above discussions with Messrs Lawson, Johnson and Dengate, all of whom appeared by telephone from separate locations on 5 December, the Court was forced to terminate the telephone conference with these participants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Despite assurances that he would remain quiet, Mr Dengate (and other unidentified persons) continued to speak so close to his phone that it was impossible to continue the directions with this disturbance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">While the transcript of the proceeding does not fully capture the resulting confusion, notwithstanding a short adjournment to remedy the problem, it was ultimately necessary to have the Court staff terminate the telephone conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Claim Group meeting of October 1 2005 
 
17 The purpose of this meeting was to resolve the dispute between Messrs Johnson and Lawson and the other members of the applicant group or, if this was not possible, to establish that they were no longer authorised by the Claim Group to conduct the proceeding on its behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">If an application under s 66B is to succeed it is necessary that the evidence clearly demonstrate that the relevant persons no longer have that authority and, for this reason, it was necessary to make careful preparation for the 1 October meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">18 In an affidavit affirmed on 8 November 2005, Mishka Holt, a solicitor with NTS, gave evidence of the preparations for the 1 October meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">On 13 and 14 September, letters were sent to all members of the Claim Group for whom NTS had postal addresses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The letter stated that the meeting was to discuss important matters in respect of the claim and to make decisions about its future conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The letter set out the proposed agenda and attached a map of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The letter also provided logistical information, including forms in respect of travel assistance, the provision of accommodation and a bus schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Ms Holt's affidavit provides that NTS paid accommodation and breakfast costs of those attending who did not reside in Broken Hill; that NTS hired buses for persons travelling to Broken Hill from Dareton, Mildura and Wilcannia; that NTS reimbursed persons for their fuel costs in relation to travelling to the meeting; and that NTS provided lunch and refreshments and an allowance for an evening meal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">19 Ms Holt also gave evidence that on 12 September she wrote to all Local Aboriginal Land Councils within the claim area for the information of their members advising them of the 1 October meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In addition, NTS placed advertisements in a number of local newspapers advising of the 1 October meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">These were published in the Mildura Midweek , the Barrier Daily Truth , the Koori Mail , and the Wilcannia News .</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In addition to numerous phone calls with members of the Claim Group, Ms Holt deposed that she had several telephone conversations with Mr Lawson, Mr Johnson and Ms Shelia Kirby, Mr Johnson's wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">She gave evidence that two days prior to the meeting, Mr Lawson informed her that he would not be attending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">20 According to the attendance list of the meeting, 58 members of the Claim Group attended the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson did not attend the meeting, although the evidence discloses that they were invited and were aware the meeting was to take place and neither Mr Lawson nor Mr Johnson sought to deny this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In addition to members of the Claim Group, the meeting was attended by:
 
 
 &#61863; Mr Danny Chapman, NTS Manager of Community Facilitation, who chaired the meeting;
 &#61863; Ms Holt and other officers of NTS;
 &#61863; Dr Kenneth Lum, anthropologist for NTS who has conducted research in relation to this native title claim since 2001;
 &#61863; Mr Frank Russo and Ms Michelle Mann, of the NNTT, as independent observers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 

21 The minutes of the meeting, which were attested to be an accurate summary by Mr Chapman and Ms Holt, were tendered to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">They show that Ms Holt and Dr Lum summarised the current status of the claim for the attendees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In particular, Dr Lum discussed the different groups that together comprise the Claim Group and the meaning of the term 'Barkandji'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He explained that the term can be used to describe a small sub-group of the Claim Group, the members of which are called Barkandji and who speak the Barkandji language; Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson are members of this sub-group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Dr Lum also explained that the other sub-groups of the Claim Group all speak various dialects of the Barkandji language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Because the area over which the claimant application is made includes the country from which these other sub-groups come, all the subgroups must be included in the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">22 The minutes record that the meeting discussed decision-making methods in the context of the requirements of s 251B of the NTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The meeting resolved that those present were sufficiently representative of the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This is consistent with evidence given by Dr Lum on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In addition, those present at the meeting confirmed that when authorising amendments to the claim and dealing with matters arising in relation to the claim there is no particular process of decision-making under traditional laws and customs that must be complied with by the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">As such, they resolved that decisions at the meeting would be made in the following manner:
 
 
 1. the decision to be made would be put in the form of a clearly worded written motion;
 2. the motion would be read out to the meeting;
 3. the motion must be moved and seconded by members of the group before being decided;
 4. the group's decision would then be made by a show of hands;
 5. a decision of the majority in relation to the motion would be a decision of the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 

23 The meeting also discussed the future management of the claim, in particular whether it should be split into two separate claims respectively addressing the northern and southern claim areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It was resolved that the Claim Group was united and to continue with the current structure of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Further, the meeting resolved to invite those members of the applicant group who disagree with a united claim to resign and authorised Murray Butcher and Derek Hardman to replace them as members of the applicant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">If the invitation was declined, the meeting decided that those who had been authorised to become the applicant must take the necessary steps to replace the present applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The meeting then authorised the so-termed 'new applicant', in which Mr Butcher and Mr Hardman replaced Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson, to make the native title claim and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The meeting also required the 'new applicant' to do all things necessary to replace the present applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">24 While Mr Russo and Ms Mann excused themselves from the meeting during the making of these resolutions because of their roles with the NNTT, they returned at the end of the meeting and verified the resolutions by reading them to the meeting and receiving no dissent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Evidence of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson 
 
25 At the hearing of the motion on 13 December 2005, both Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson gave evidence and made submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In essence, their evidence disclosed their view that the term 'Barkandji' referred to a narrower group than the whole Claim Group: see [22] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They believed that this narrower group, of which they were members, ought to make a separate native title claim over a smaller area of land, mainly in the southern part of the claim area, than that presently claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The legislative scheme 
 
26 Section 61(1) of the NTA states, inter alia , that the persons who may make a claimant application include:
 
 'A person or persons authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed, provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">' 

27 Subsection 61(2) of the NTA provides that the persons authorised to make the claimant application by the native title claim group are jointly the 'applicant' and none of the other members of the native title claim group is the 'applicant'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">This leads to the somewhat awkward situation where the term 'applicant' is applied to a group of separately named individuals: see Noble v Murgha [2005] FCAFC 211 at [6] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Other provisions of the NTA relevant to the present application are:
 
 ' 66B Replacing the applicant 
 Application to replace applicant in claimant application 
 
 
 (1) One or more members of the native title claim group (the claim group ) in relation to a claimant application, or of the compensation claim group (also the claim group ) in relation to a compensation application, may apply to the Federal Court for an order that the member, or the members jointly, replace the current applicant for the application on the grounds that: 
 
 
 (a) either: 
 (i) the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; or 
 (ii) the current applicant has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the member or members are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 
 
 
 Court order 
 
 
 (2) The Court may make the order if it is satisfied that the grounds are established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">' 
 
 
 
 ' 251B Authorising the making of applications 
 For the purposes of this Act, all the persons in a native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application or a compensation application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if: 
 
 (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or 
 (b) where there is no such process--the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group or compensation claim group, in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 

28 In Daniel v Western Australia (2002) 194 ALR 278 (' Daniel ') at [17], French J drew from s 66B the following conditions that must be met for an order under the section to be made:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There is a claimant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Each applicant for an order under s 66B is a member of the native title group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The person to be replaced is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Alternatively, the person to be replaced has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The persons making the application under s 66B are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 

See also, Holborow v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1428 ; Ward v Northern Territory of Australia (2003) 196 ALR 32; Lawson ; and Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">29 It is pertinent to note, however, that the Court retains a discretion not to make the orders sought under s 66B of the NTA: see Ward v Northern Territory [2002] FCA 171 (' Ward ') at [16] and Daniel at [18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Consideration 
 
30 This proceeding plainly entails a claimant application and the evidence reveals that each of the persons seeking to comprise the applicant is a member of the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">As such, the issues in the present context revolve around whether the Claim Group no longer authorises Messrs Lawson and Johnson to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it and whether those making the application under s 66B of the NTA are so authorised by the Claim Group in their stead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">31 On the basis of the evidence set out above at [19]-[20], I am satisfied that all reasonable steps were taken to advise members of the Claim Group of the 1 October meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In addition, adequate assistance was provided to permit members of the Claim Group to attend where they did not reside in Broken Hill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">While neither Mr Lawson nor Mr Johnson attended the 1 October meeting, I am satisfied that they were aware it was taking place and voluntarily chose not to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">As the resolutions made at the meeting and the expert evidence of Dr Lum demonstrate, those attending the meeting were representative of the Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In my view, none of the concerns expressed by O'Loughlin J in Ward at [24] are applicable in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">32 Further, I am satisfied as to the accuracy of the minutes of the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In particular, I accept, on the basis of the independent verification, that those present made the resolutions recorded: see [25] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The evidence reveals that the meeting resolved that there was not a process of decision-making under traditional laws and customs for decisions of this kind .</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">This is supported by Dr Lum's evidence that in his opinion the Claim Group's traditional decision-making processes do not apply to the current circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Those present at the meeting therefore adopted the decision-making process set out above at [23], by which they decided to revoke the authorisation of the applicant as presently constituted and authorised a new group to form the applicant in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">As such, I am satisfied that the requirements of s 66B(1) of the NTA are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">33 For these reasons, I am satisfied that the orders sought, insofar as they relate to the removal of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group and the inclusion of Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman, should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Patricia Johnson 
 
34 As noted above, the orders sought in the amended notice of motion would not only exclude Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the group comprising the applicant but also another current member, Ms Patricia Johnson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Although the issue of Ms Johnson's continuing role was discussed at the 1 October meeting, there was no resolution to remove her from the applicant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">I am, however, satisfied by the evidence before me that Ms Johnson has clearly indicated that she does not wish to continue as a member of the applicant group and for this reason it is appropriate to make the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">35 The evidence to which I refer is to be found in the affidavits of Philippe Savidis and Mishka Holt, solicitors with NTS, affirmed respectively on 7 and 14 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Both solicitors attest to their repeated attempts to discuss the claim with Ms Johnson and her repeated assertions that, owing to illness, she is unable to carry out her responsibilities and no longer wishes to remain a member of the group comprising the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Ms Johnson has not provided an affidavit in accordance with s 64(5) of the NTA despite requests from NTS and on this basis I am satisfied that her name should not be included as a person who comprises the applicant in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Conclusion 
 
36 For the above reasons, I will make the orders sought in the amended notice filed on 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">However, it is pertinent to note that in making these orders the Court is not adversely reflecting in any way on the conduct of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">There clearly has been a deeply held disagreement within the Claim Group and this has been resolved in accordance with the provisions of the NTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">As was discussed at the 1 October meeting, an order made under s 66B(2) of the NTA does not remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the Claim Group, nor does it affect their standing according to traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">As members of the Claim Group both will continue to have the opportunity to participate in discussions as to the future conduct of the native title claim and it is to be hoped that they will avail themselves of the opportunity to do so.</sentence>
