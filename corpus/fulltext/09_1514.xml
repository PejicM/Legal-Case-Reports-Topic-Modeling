<sentence id="s0">
 This is an application to review a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("Tribunal") dated 9 September 2009 made under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The sole ground of the application is that the Tribunal erred in law and committed a jurisdictional error in determining that it had jurisdiction to review a specific decision of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant submits that, properly understood, that decision, made in respect of review application No AAT Q2009/1524, was not a decision to which the Tribunal has jurisdiction conferred by the AAT Act or any other Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant seeks the following relief pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): A writ of prohibition restraining the first respondent from proceeding to review application No AATQ2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the first respondent dated 9 September 2009, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review application No AATQ2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">A declaration that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to review application No AATQ2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Further, the applicant claims under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act"): An order quashing or setting aside the decision of the first respondent dated 9 September 2009, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review application No 2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">A declaration that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to review application No 2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It is common ground between the parties that the Court has jurisdiction to determine this application pursuant to either s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) or the ADJR Act, and that the matter is amenable to the relief sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On the basis that the parties accept that the Court has jurisdiction to make the relief sought, I do not propose to consider the issue of jurisdiction further in this judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Summary
 In summary, the applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to correctly construe the relevant provisions of the Accreditation Grant Principles 1999 (Cth) ("the Principles") made pursuant to s 96-1 of the Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth) ("the Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">More specifically, the applicant contends that, in summary: Section 7.1 of the Principles requires that, in order to be a "reviewable decision", a decision made under s 2.32 must be a " Variation of the period for which residential care services is to be accredited".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The second respondent applied for a further period of accreditation under the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The applicant decided to grant accreditation for a further two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The second respondent applied to the applicant to reconsider the decision in respect of the length of the period of accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicant affirmed the reconsidered decision in respect of the two years accreditation (in other words --- the applicant did not vary the period of accreditation on reconsideration).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On application to the Tribunal for review of the reconsidered decision, the Tribunal held that the applicant had made a "reviewable decision" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the Principles because "reviewable decision" included a decision adopting or affirming the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant contends that the Tribunal was wrong in so holding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The second respondent contends that the Tribunal was correct in finding that the reconsidered decision was a "reviewable decision" within the meaning of s 7.1 , and that any other interpretation lends itself to producing an absurdity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Background
 The background facts to this application are found primarily in the affidavits of Mr Michael Palfrey, solicitor with Clayton Utz lawyers, the solicitors for the applicant, and Ms Victoria Crawford, General Manager Accreditation of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The background facts are not in dispute in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The applicant is an independent company limited by guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is responsible for managing the accreditation and ongoing supervision of Commonwealth-funded aged care homes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicant's functions set out in the Principles include assessing and determining applications made by accredited residential care services that wish to be accredited for a further period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant performs this function through, inter alia , conducting accreditation site audits and review audits which involve an assessment team visiting the service's premises to undertake a review of the quality of services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The team then presents to the applicant a Site Report with a recommendation as to whether the service should be accredited, and, if so, the period of accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">After receiving the Site Report the agency applicant then decide whether or not to accredit the service: s 2.27 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">If the decision is to accredit the service provider, the agency must determine the period of accreditation, or if already accredited, the further period of accreditation: s 2.28 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The second respondent is an approved provider of residential aged care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It has a residential aged care facility at 9 Havana Street, Rowes Bay in Queensland ("the facility").</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The facility has been accredited by the applicant since 27 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In response to an application for a further period of accreditation by the second respondent in January 2009 an assessment team of the applicant conducted a site audit of the facility between 20 and 22 January 2009 and provided the second respondent with a Site Audit Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">On 4 March 2009 the applicant made a decision ("the original decision") to accredit the second respondent, pursuant to s 2.27 and s 2.28 of the Principles, for two years from 30 March 2009 to 20 March 2011.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It appears that the second respondent had expected to be accredited for three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In practice the maximum period for which a service is accredited is three years (TS p 5 ll 46-47).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On 10 March 2009 the second respondent applied to the applicant for reconsideration of the accreditation period pursuant to s 2.32(1) of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">On 18 March 2009 the applicant made a further decision ("the reconsideration decision") namely: 
 
 Not to vary the site audit decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The home is accredited for two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 

 On 15 April 2009 the second respondent lodged application No AATQ2009/1524 with the Tribunal to review the reconsideration decision pursuant to s 7.2 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Statutory scheme
 The statutory scheme is helpfully summarised in the decision of the Tribunal and submissions of both parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
In summary:
 The Act establishes that residential care subsidies are payable under Pt 3.1, to "approved providers" who, inter alia , meet accreditation requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">"Accreditation requirements" are defined in Sch 1 to the Act to mean requirements set out in s 42-4 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Section 42-4(1) of the Act provides that a residential care service meets its accreditation requirement at all times during which there is in force an accreditation of the service by an accreditation body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The applicant is an accreditation body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Section 96-1 of the Act provides that the Minister may make, inter alia , Accreditation Grant Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">These principles have been made (namely "the Principles" which I identified earlier in this judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Part 2 of the Principles provides for the accreditation of residential care services such as the Rowes Bay facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Division 2 Pt 2 of the Principles provides for procedures for accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Division 3 Pt 2 of the Principles provides for the procedures for the assessment of applications for accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">A decision by an accreditation body to accredit or not to accredit is made pursuant to s 2.27 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">If the decision is to accredit, the period of accreditation must also be decided pursuant to s 2.28 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Section 2.32 of the Principles allows an applicant for accreditation to apply for reconsideration of the period for which the service is to be accredited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Specifically the section provides: 
 
 
 (1) The applicant may, within 7 days after being told about a decision to accredit the residential care service, give to the accreditation body a written request to reconsider the period mentioned in paragraph 2.29(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 

 
 
 
 (2) The accreditation body must, within 7 days of receiving a request: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) decide whether or not to vary the period; and
 (b) tell the applicant, in writing, about its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 

 
 
 
 (3) If the decision is to vary the period, the accreditation body must also give the applicant a replacement certificate setting out the revised period for which the service is to be accredited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 

 Section 7.2 of the Principles provides that an application may be made to the Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision A table in s 7.1 of the Principles sets out a table of "reviewable decisions" as follows: 
 
 7.1 What is a reviewable decision 
 

 
 
 Each of the following decisions of the accreditation body is a reviewable decision : 
 

 Item Decision Section under which decision is made 2 Variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited 2.32 3 Refusal of an application on reconsideration 2.38 4 Refusal to include an applicant's nominated assessor in an assessment team 2.44 5 Refusal to accept an applicant's objection to a quality assessor 2.45 6 Revocation of an accreditation 3.15 and 3.24 7 Variation of a period of accreditation 3.15 and 3.24 8 Refusal of an application to review registrar's decision to remove from register 8.6 
 Decision of the Tribunal ([2009] AATA 684)
 The Tribunal considered the primary contention of the applicant, namely that a decision not to vary the period of accreditation determined in the original decision was not itself a reviewable decision because it was not a " variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Tribunal considered that if the applicant's interpretation was correct, an adverse decision regarding the period of accreditation (for example, a decision to accredit for a shorter period) which was subsequently affirmed in the course of an internal review process was practically unreviewable by the Tribunal (at [7]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Importantly the Tribunal continued: 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">While the outcome contended for by the agency may surprise at first glance, the agency suggests it is not unusual when one has regard to the operation of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The agency's written submissions dated 17 July 2009 point out that a reviewable decision made under s 3.24 would be subject to the same objection if the reviewable decision affirmed what had already been decided at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Tribunal would only have the power to deal with the outcome of the reconsideration if the reconsideration varied what had already been decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">As I understand it, the agency is arguing that the legislative scheme has intentionally created an administrative regime in which an adverse decision can only be reviewed once.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">If it is unchanged upon review --- even if that review is an internal review, rather than an independent review conducted by the Tribunal --- that is the end of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I accept that the interpretation contended for by the agency is open upon a plain reading of the words of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It is arguably the most obvious interpretation of what is written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">But it does seem to be at odds with the purposes of the legislative scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">That scheme has created an accreditation process that is administered by a private organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is no surprise in the circumstances that the Principles should provide for appeal rights in respect of decisions of the agency which go to questions of accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The scheme contemplates an internal reconsideration of a decision as the first step in the appeal process, but did the Parliament intend that the process should end there if the internal review affirmed what had already been decided?</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The answer to that question appears to depend on the nature of a reviewable decision under the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">A reviewable decision is, first and foremost, the product of a review of the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">But that review is not simply a reconsideration of the process that was undertaken at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Principles appear to contemplate the agency starting afresh and reviewing all of the material on reconsideration with a view to reaching a fresh decision as to what should be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">A perusal of the text of the reconsideration decision in this case confirms that is what occurred here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Where, as here, the agency decides on reconsideration of that material that the original decision to change the accreditation period was right, it is effectively adopting the decision that the period of accreditation be varied from what it was before the original decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The outcome of the reconsideration decision is, in a practical sense, a variation rather than an affirmation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">To treat it as anything else would be to prefer an overly restrictive interpretation of the words in the Principles that appears to defeat the intentions of the legislative scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That scheme favours meaningful administrative review of the private agency's decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 

 Accordingly the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine application No AATQ2009/1524.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Submissions of the parties
 Both written and oral submissions of the parties in this case were helpful and clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In summary, the applicant submitted as follows: In reply, the second respondent submitted in summary: The Court should adopt a broader, contextual interpretation of the right of review conferred by s 7.1, so as to confer such a right in respect of all decisions made under section regardless of the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The focus thus becomes the fact that there has been the exercise of the statutory function, rather than its outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The statutory scheme is to provide rights of external review of decisions made in the exercise of certain powers under the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In essence, rights of review are conferred under s 7.1 where the statutory function is exercised in such a way as to cause the person affected by the decision dissatisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">On the construction contended by the applicant, if on reconsideration the accreditation body decided to vary the accreditation period, either upward or downward, by a single day, an approved provider could choose to have that decision reviewed on its merits by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">However if the accreditation body decided that the period of accreditation should remain precisely the same, no appeal lies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The substantive statutory function exercised in the making of a decision under s 2.32(2)(a) is "whether or not to vary the period".</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Accordingly, it is clear that the expression "Variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" as used in item 2 of the table in s 7.1 of the Principles is a shorthand method of describing the nature of the decision to be made under s 2.32 in response to an application for reconsideration of the period of accreditation (namely whether or not to vary).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">A number of the decisions set out in s 7.1 leave the status quo unchanged, yet confer rights of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is appropriate for the Court to give effect to the legislative intent where the result otherwise would be absurd, extraordinary, capricious, irrational or obscure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In its decision, the Tribunal strove for an interpretation which would not promote absurdity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Consideration
 In these proceedings there is, in essence, only one question of substance for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Does "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the principles and by reference to s 2.32 of the Principles, include a decision to confirm the period for which residential care service is to be accredited?</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">If the answer to this question is no, the applicant will be successful in its appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In my view the answer to the question is reached in two stages, namely: Considering the natural meaning of "variation"; and Considering the meaning of the phrase "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" in the broader context of the statutory framework.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Natural meaning of "variation"
 The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd edition) defines "variation" as follows: 
 
 I.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Difference, divergence, or discrepancy between two or more things or persons 
 

 
 
 II.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The fact of varying in condition, character, degree, or other quality; the fact of undergoing modification or alteration, esp within certain limits b .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The action of making some change or alteration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 

 "Vary" in turn is defined as: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Of things: To undergo change or alteration; to pass from one condition, state, etc., to another... 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">To differ, to exhibit or present divergence, from something else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 

 The fact that "vary" imports the notion of change in some form has also been endorsed by Courts in different contexts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I note, for example, the following comment of Andrews J in The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone (1906) 2 IrR 164 at 170: 
 
 The Court of Quarter Sessions, it will be observed, is empowered, on hearing the appeal, to confirm, vary or reverse the order appealed against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">I think each of these three words has a separate and appropriate meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">"Confirm" requires no explanation; "vary" in my opinion, means alter in part , as distinguished from discharging the entire order appealed against , and making a wholly different one; and "reverse", in my opinion, imports more than discharge , and means " changed to the contrary ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(emphasis in original) 
 

 In R v Industrial Court (S.A.); ex parte Mount Gunson Mines Pty Ltd (1982) 2 I.R 336 at 340, after considering The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone Mitchell J (King CJ and White J agreeing) observed: 
 
 The dictionary meaning does not accord with that given by Andrews J in that there is no suggestion that the change or alteration must be a change or alteration only in part .</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">
 

 The common theme in both the dictionary and judicial commentary is that plain meaning of "variation" entails an alteration of some kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">To that extent, "variation" is distinguishable in that sense from "confirmation", which entails preservation of the status quo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The context in which the phrase appears in section 7.1
 The more complex question however is whether, in the broader context of the statutory scheme, "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" includes a decision by the applicant not to vary its previous decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Plain meaning of words
 There is little doubt that "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" means, prima facie , circumstances where there is a change to the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">At first blush, the proposition that this includes a decision not to vary an earlier decision appears absurd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There is long tradition of Courts assuming that Parliament, through the enactment of legislation, intends what is enacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">As Lord Atkinson said in Vacher &amp; Sons Ltd v London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; [1913] AC 107 at 121-122: 
 
 If the language of a statute is plain, admitting of only one meaning, the Legislature must be taken to have meant and intended what it has plainly expressed, and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be enforced though it should lead to absurd or mischievous results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">If the language of this sub-section be not controlled by some of the other provisions of the statute, it must, since its language is plain and unambiguous, be enforced, and your Lordships' House sitting judicially is not concerned with the question whether the policy it embodies is wise or unwise, or whether it leads to consequences just or unjust, beneficial or mischievous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">
 

 More recently the High Court in Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 considered the risks in imputing meaning to a legislative provision, which meaning is not apparent on the face of the provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">As Gibbs CJ said (at 304-305): 
 
 It is an elementary and fundamental principle that the object of the court, in interpreting a statute, "is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used": River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743 , at p 763.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is only by considering the meaning of the words used by the legislature that the court can ascertain its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">And it is not unduly pedantic to begin with the assumption that words mean what they say: cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Cody v. J. H. Nelson Pty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">[1947] HCA 17 ; (1947) 74 CLR 629 , at p 648.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Of course, no part of a statute can be considered in isolation from its context - the whole must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">If, when the section in question is read as part of the whole instrument, its meaning is clear and unambiguous, generally speaking "nothing remains but to give effect to the generally speaking "nothing remains but to give effect to the unqualified, words": Metropolitan Gas Co. v. Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union [1925] HCA 5 ; (1925) 35 CLR 449 , at p 455 There are cases where the result of giving words their ordinary meaning may be so irrational that the court is forced to the conclusion that the draftsman has made a mistake, and the canons of construction are not so rigid as to prevent a realistic solution in such a case: see per Lord Reid in Connaught Fur Trimmings Ltd. v. Cramas Properties Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">[1965] 1 WLR 892 , at p 899; (1965) 2 ALL ER 382 , at p 386.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Examples of that sort of case may be found in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes , 12th ed., (1969), at p. 228 et seq., and Craies on Statute Law, 7th ed., (1971), at p. 520 et seq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However, if the language of a statutory provision is clear and unambiguous, and is consistent and harmonious with the other provisions of the enactment, and can be intelligibly applied to the subject matter with which it deals, it must be given its ordinary and grammatical meaning, even if it leads to a result that may seem inconvenient or unjust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">To say this is not to insist on too literal an interpretation, or to deny that the court should seek the real intention of the legislature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The danger that lies in departing from the ordinary meaning of unambiguous provisions is that "it may degrade into mere judicial criticism of the propriety of the acts of the Legislature", as Lord Moulton said in Vacher &amp; Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; (1913) AC 107 , at p 130; it may lead judges to put their own ideas of justice or social policy in place of the words of the statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On the other hand, if two constructions are open, the court will obviously prefer that which will avoid what it considers to be inconvenience or injustice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Since language, read in its context, very often proves to be ambiguous, this last mentioned rule is one that not infrequently falls to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">
 

 Similarly, Aickin J observed (at 336-337): 
 
 In Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">[1978] 1 WLR 231 ; (1978) 1 All ER 948 , five members of the House of Lords dealt with this question and although their speeches differ in emphasis they were united in declining to read words into the Act there in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Viscount Dilhorne, with whom Lord Fraser of Tullybelton agreed, said [1978] 1 WLR, at pp 234-235; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 951: 
 

 
 
 
 It is now fashionable to talk of a purposive construction of a statute, but it has been recognised since the 17th century that it is the task of the judiciary in interpreting an Act to seek to interpret it "according to the intent of them that made it" (Coke 4 Inst.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">330).</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 
 

 
 
 
 If it were the case that it appeared that an Act might have been better drafted, or that amendment to it might be less productive of anomalies, it is not open to the court to remedy the defect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">That must be left to the Legislature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 
 

 
 
 
 The appellants contend that in view of the anomalies which they say would result from the interpretation the respondent seeks to have placed on the paragraph, to have paragraph 8(2) read as if it said: "who also took part and at the date of the dismissal were taking part in that action".</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">As Stephenson L.J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">said in the Court of Appeal, the paragraph does not so provide.</sentence>

 "It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do" said Lord Mersey in Thompson v. Goold &amp; Co. (1910) AC 409, at p 420.</sentence>

 Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed with Viscount Dilhorne but added some further observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">After referring to the rule in Heydon's Case [1584] EngR 9 ; (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a , (76 ER 637) his Lordship said [1978] 1 WLR, at p 236; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 953: 
 

 
 
 
 "The final task of construction is still, as always, to ascertain the meaning of what the draftsman has said, rather than to ascertain what the draftsman meant to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">But if the draftsmanship is correct these should coincide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">So if the words are capable of more than one meaning it is a perfectly legitimate intermediate step in construction to choose between potential meanings by various tests (statutory, objective, anomaly, etc.) which throw light on what the draftsman meant to say.</sentence>

 At 338-339 Aickin J also endorsed comments of Lord Scarman in Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">[1978] 1 WLR 231 at 239 where his Lordship said: 
 
 If the words used by Parliament are plain, there is no room for the "anomalies" test, unless the consequences are so absurd that, without going outside the statute, one can see that Parliament must have made a drafting mistake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">If words "have been inadvertently used", it is legitimate for the court to substitute what is apt to avoid the intention of the legislature being defeated: per MacKinnon L.J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">in Sutherland Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">[1938] Ch 174 , at p 201 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">This is an acceptable exception to the general rule that plain language excludes a consideration of anomalies, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">mischievous or absurd consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">If a study of the statute as a whole leads inexorably to the conclusion that Parliament has erred in its choice of words, e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">used "and" when "or" was clearly intended, the courts can, and must, eliminate the error by interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">But mere "manifest absurdity" is not enough: it must be an error (of commission or omission) which in its context defeats the intention of the Act.</sentence>

 Turning now to the terms of item 2 in the table in s 7.1 of the Principles, I consider that the meaning of the words "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" is plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">There is no ambiguity to warrant further exploration in an attempt to identify the intention of Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The intention of Parliament appears clearly in the words used --- a reconsideration decision is reviewable when the accreditation body varies (either up or down) the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">A reconsideration decision where the accreditation body simply confirms its original decision in relation to the period of accreditation is not a decision which "varies" that period --- and it is not reviewable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">To read into "variation" a meaning which includes " no variation" strikes me as absurd, and in stark contradiction to the specific language of s 7.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The second respondent submitted that an interpretation which excludes review of a reconsideration decision which merely confirms the original decision of the applicant is potentially artificial and irrational.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">However an interpretation the result of which is surprising, even illogical, does not mean that that interpretation is not sound or that Parliament did not intend that outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The second respondent also submitted that the decisions listed in the second column of the table in s 7.1 of the Principles were actually a "shorthand" description of decisions made under the corresponding sections identified in the first column of the table and, in that respect, strict reliance could not be placed on the language used in the second column of the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">As Mr Horneman-Wren submitted, the tabular format of s 7.1 does not always strictly use the wording of the provisions within the various sections, thus requiring a person construing the section to look beyond those words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">This point is illustrated by reference to the other items listed in the table in s 7.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">So: Paragraph 2.38 of the Principles is headed "Decision on reconsideration", and so far as relevant provides that: 
 
 (1) The accreditation body must, after considering an application for reconsideration, decide: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to accredit the service; or
 (b) not to accredit the service 
 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 (3) If the accreditation body decides to accredit a residential care service, the accreditation body must decide: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the period for which the service is to be accredited; and
 (b) whether there are any matters in respect of which improvements must be made to improve its compliance with the Accreditation Standards; and
 (c) the form and frequency of support contacts with the service 
 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
However item 3 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.38 and describes the reviewable decision as "Refusal of an application on reconsideration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Paragraph 2.44 of the Principles is headed "Accreditation body may refuse to include nominee", and so far as relevant in subs (1) provides that: 
 
 The accreditation body may refuse to include in an assessment team a quality assessor nominated by the applicant if the assessor is not eligible for inclusion in the team under subsection 2.45 (1),(2),(3), or (4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">
 

 
However item 4 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.44 and describes the reviewable decision as "Refusal to include an applicant's nominated assessor in an assessment team".</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Paragraph 2.45 of the Principles is headed "Eligibility for assessment team", and so far as relevant provides that: 
 
 (1)Each member of an assessment team must be a registered quality assessor 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 (5) The applicant may, in writing, within 14 days after being told under subsection 2.42 (5) who is in the team, object to a quality assessor in the team because the assessor is not eligible for inclusion in the team under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">(6) If an applicant makes an objection for subsection (5), the accreditation body must decide to: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) accept the objection and create a new assessment team; or
 (b) reject the objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 
 

 
However item 5 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.45 and describes the reviewable decision as "Refusal to accept an applicant's objection to a quality assessor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Paragraph 3.15 and para 3.24 of the Principles are both headed "Decision about review audit" and so far as relevant in subs (1) provide that: 
 
 The accreditation body may decide:
 (a) to vary the period of accreditation; or
 (b) to revoke the accreditation of the service; or
 (c) not to revoke the accreditation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">
 

 
However item 6 of the table in s 7.1 refers to these sections and describes the reviewable decision as "Revocation of an accreditation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Similarly item 7 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 3.15 and s 3.24 of the Principles and describes the reviewable decision as "Variation of a period of accreditation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Paragraph 8.6 of the Principles is headed "Decision on application" and so far as relevant in subs (1) provides that: 
 
 (1) The accreditation body must decide whether to grant or refuse the person's application within 28 days after receiving it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">
 

 
However item 8 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 8.6 and describes the reviewable decision as "Refusal of an application to review registrar's decision to remove from register".</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">While it is feasible that the words in the second column of the table in s 7.1 are merely intended to act as an abridged reference to the section identified in the third column, in my view this proposition does not withstand close scrutiny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The better view is that the words in the second column of the table, including the words "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" have independent significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">I consider that the words in the second column describe the actual decision which is reviewable, and the reference to the section in the third column is a reference to the section pursuant to which the specific reviewable decision is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">So, for example: I agree with Mr Bickford for the applicant that, despite the arguably inelegant drafting, the second column in the table in s 7.1 actually describes the reviewable decision and is not mere "shorthand".</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">For this reason alone, in my view the decision of the Tribunal cannot be sustained and the appeal should be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">However in the event that I am wrong in this finding, and also in deference to the thorough and well-reasoned submissions of the second respondent, I now turn to consider whether, in the context of the legislation (including the Principles), the phrase "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" in s 7.1 of the Principles bears the interpretation contended by the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Broader context
 First, I note that it is common ground that no assistance can be gleaned from explanatory memoranda or speeches in Parliament as to the meaning of the phrase "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" in s 7.1 (TS p 5 ll 7-14).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Accordingly, it is necessary to turn to the relevant legislative instrument itself, namely the Principles, in order to identify whether the decision of the applicant falls within the meaning of "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" and is thus a reviewable decision for the purpose of the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Second, a key pillar of the second respondent's case is that the statutory scheme provides for external review of decisions made in the exercise of certain powers under the Principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The second respondent submitted that, in each instance in which a right of review is conferred under s 7.1, the review available extends to those aspects of the exercise of the statutory function in such a way as to cause the person affected by the decision residual dissatisfaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">A number of the decisions set out in s 7.1 leave the status quo unchanged, but confer rights of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">In fact in a number of cases it is the fact that the status quo has not changed which gives rise to a right of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Accordingly, the right of review conferred by item 2 of s 7.1 should be construed in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In my view the interpretation of s 7.1 suggested by this line of reasoning is credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">However after considering submissions of both parties I am not persuaded that I should so construe item 2 of s 7.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">I have formed this view for the following reasons: In my view, it does not therefore follow that this means that any decision of the applicant pursuant to s 2.32 with which an applicant for accreditation is dissatisfied is reviewable by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Finally, while I note the submission of the second respondent concerning to the possibility of a reconsideration decision whereby the accreditation period of a residential care facility is varied upward or downward by a single day, I am not persuaded that the interpretation of s 7.1 should be resolved by an apprehension of extreme examples and distorting possibilities (cf Singh v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 43 ; (2004) 222 CLR 322 at [155] , Forge v ASIC [2006] HCA 44 ; (2006) 229 ALR 223 at [46] , New South Wales v Commonwealth [2006] HCA 52 ; (2006) 231 ALR 1 at [188] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Conclusion
 In my view the appeal should be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">I certify that the preceding forty-seven (47) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
