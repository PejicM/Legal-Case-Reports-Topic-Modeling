<sentence id="s0">
 
1 I have before me an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Smith delivered on 21 November 2006 by which the Federal Magistrate made orders that an application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court by the present applicant be dismissed pursuant to rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules on the ground that the application did not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">His Honour also made an order that the applicant pay the first respondent's costs in the sum of $2,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The application before Federal Magistrate Smith was an application filed on 29 August 2006 which sought an order that the respondents show cause why a remedy should not be granted under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 24 August 1998 and handed down on 25 August 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the Minister's delegate dated 26 September 1997 which refused the grant of a protection visa to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 In support of the present application, the applicant has filed an affidavit which reflects these contentions:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 11 June 1997 I lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs under the Migration Act 1958 ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">
 
 On 26 September 1997 a delegate of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs refused to grant a protection visa and on 16 October 1997 I sought review that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 24 August 1998 the Tribunal affirms the decision not to grant a protection visa to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">
 
 I haven't received the decision of the Tribunal on 24 August 1998 until August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I filed the application to the FMC for review that RRT decision and I applied for an order that the time for making the application be extended under section 477 of the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 
 
 
 
 
 Under the Migration Act 1958 the decision to refuse to grant the protection visa is known as a "privative clause decision" pursuant to section 474 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">However, the High Court of Australia has held that such a decision can be reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 The Federal Magistrate Smith shouldn't [have] have dismissed my application for review [of] that RRT decision under rule 44.12 on the ground that it does raise an arguable case for my claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">' 
 


 
4 The affidavit attaches a notice of appeal and in the notice of appeal the applicant asserts these grounds of proposed appeal:
 
 'A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The judgment of Judge Smith FM rely on the respondent filed the submission under section 477 of Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The application is dismissed under rule 44.12 on the ground that it does not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In any event the important issue for the court is whether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant material supplied by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">If it did whether this would amount to an error or jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 

5 It is clear that the judgment of the Federal Magistrate is an interlocutory judgment and thus the obligation cast upon the applicant for leave to appeal is to demonstrate that in the circumstances, the decision of Federal Magistrate Smith is attended by 'sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant must then further demonstrate whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Those principles derive from Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc. (1991) 33 FCR 397 and are consistent with the principles in Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 In dealing with the application before Federal Magistrate Smith, his Honour turned to the requirements of rule 44.12(1) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That rule provides, relevantly, that at a hearing of an application of the kind made by the applicant for an order to show cause, the court may - if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed - dismiss the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Federal Magistrate Smith concluded that the application did not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed and accordingly dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">7 In doing so, his Honour considered a range of matters put by the applicant concerning the criticism of the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">At paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, his Honour considered the analysis by the Tribunal of the various claims of the applicant and particularly the foundation upon which the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it could not accept the claims of the applicant and was thus unable to be affirmatively satisfied that the applicant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 Nothing in the material filed by the applicant in support of the present application, nor any matter identified in the notice of appeal, demonstrates an error or 'sufficient doubt' as to the decision to warrant the matter being reconsidered by a Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Nor does the material demonstrate whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">However, fundamentally the difficulty with this application is that the applicant has simply failed to demonstrate any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate by reference to any material he has put before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 The applicant appeared today in person, unrepresented, but with the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I invited the applicant to put to me any matter that may support the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The applicant says that these matters occurred some time ago and he is not now able to remember the facts or the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It is clear from the affidavit I have read and the material filed by the applicant that some person has assisted the applicant in the formulation of this material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, the material simply does not establish any question of 'sufficiency of doubt' about the Federal Magistrate's decision and even with the assistance of the interpreter, the applicant is not able to demonstrate to me why the Federal Magistrate's decision in determining that no arguable case had been raised, is wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 Accordingly, the application must necessarily be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">11 There is a procedural matter that needs to be addressed in terms of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The respondent has sought a direction that the title of the respondent be altered to 'Minister for Immigration and Citizenship' and I make that direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I also direct that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as a second respondent for the purposes of the dismissal order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I also order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
