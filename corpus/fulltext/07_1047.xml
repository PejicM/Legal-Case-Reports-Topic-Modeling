1 This application is made pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as it stood in 2003 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and includes a claim for the tort of inducing a breach of contract or otherwise interfering with contractual relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application relates to a chain of events which took place at or in connection with a building site in Wollongong, New South Wales, during September and October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The first applicant is A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd ("Silvestri P/L"), the family company of Mr Antonio Silvestri and his wife Mrs Laura Silvestri, which carried on business as a demolition and excavation contractor on construction sites in the Wollongong area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The second applicant, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, was an employee of the Commonwealth at the time these proceedings were instituted and had powers delegated to him by the Employment Advocate to make an application in respect of conduct in contravention of Pt XA of the Workplace Relations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">No point is now taken as to his standing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 There are five respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The first respondent, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the CFMEU"), is an organisation registered as an organisation of employees under the Workplace Relations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The second respondent ("CFMEU NSW") is the New South Wales branch of the CFMEU, is registered as an organisation under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) and is a body corporate by virtue of s 222 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The remaining respondents are individuals connected with the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In 2003 Mr Peter Primmer was a full-time organiser employed by CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He was a member of both the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Mr Michael Lane was employed as a full-time organiser for the CFMEU and was an elected conference delegate of that organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He was a member of both the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr David Kelly was employed by CFMEU NSW and was an elected official performing duties as an organiser for each of the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">For most purposes it is not necessary to distinguish between CFMEU and CFMEU NSW in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is sufficient to refer to the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 LGB Contracting Pty Ltd ("LGB") is not a party, but is central to the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">LGB was the developer and builder of a substantial project at 26---28 Market Street Wollongong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It had not previously built in Wollongong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Demolition and excavation works were required before construction could commence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Louis Grujoski ("Grujoski") was one of the two directors of LGB --- the other being his brother, Mr Nick Grujoski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE CASES 
 
5 The applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">From about 11 September 2003 Lane had several meetings with management personnel of LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">His objective was to cause LGB to enter into a site agreement and an enterprise bargaining agreement ("EBA") with the Union to cover the project and also to cause all subcontractors engaged on the site to have an EBA with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That would effectively ensure that the project was manned only by Union members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It was made clear that only Union approved subcontractors should be engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Lane made threats of industrial action and general disruption to back up his demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">6 On the day of Lane's first visit, two inspectors from WorkCover NSW ("WorkCover") attended the site at his request concerning occupational health and safety policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As a result, the site was shut down for two days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">7 The first test of strength occurred when Lane learned in mid-October 2003 that LGB proposed to engage Silvestri P/L as excavation subcontractor to replace the existing subcontractor who had been sacked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Silvestri P/L had no agreement with the Union and Antonio Silvestri was not a union member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">That decision had been made by the newly appointed site or project manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Lane and Primmer attended the site on 20 October 2003 and threatened severe repercussions if Silvestri P/L attempted to work on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 Early on the following day, Silvestri P/L commenced work, with Antonio Silvestri himself operating the excavator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">A fleet of trucks was engaged in carting excavated material from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The previous excavator had operated a similar system for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">At about 9.30 am Lane, having spoken to one of the principals of LGB, arrived by car at the site, followed later by Primmer and Kelly in another car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Lane effectively shut the site by parking his car across the vehicular entrance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Threats by the Union officials, plus action on the part of personnel from the Wollongong City Council ("the Council") (initiated by the Union officials) led to the site being shut down for some days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As a result of the threats by Union officials, on the afternoon of 21 October 2003 LGB decided to terminate the services of Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">During the events of 21 October 2003, Kelly told one of the truck drivers that he, and any other worker on site, had to be a member of the Union to be allowed to work on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">9 The termination took place on the following day after a further meeting of LGB personnel with Union officials where further threats were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Silvestri P/L was replaced by a subcontractor nominated by the Union officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Union officials again sought to have LGB enter an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Once the new excavation contractor came on site there was no Union inspection or inspection by WorkCover or Council officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">10 The applicants' claims are:
 
 &#8226; That the conduct of one or more of the individual respondents contravened s 170NC(1)(c) of the Workplace Relations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">&#8226; That the conduct of one or more of the individual respondents contravened s 298SC(c) of the Workplace Relations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">&#8226; In relation to Silvestri P/L's contract with LGB, that one or more of the individual respondents engaged in conduct amounting to the tort of inducing breach of contract or interference with contractual relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">&#8226; That one or more of the individual respondents contravened s 45D of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 &#8226; That either or both of the CFMEU and CFMEU NSW are liable for the conduct of the individual respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">

11 The respondents deny much of the detail of the applicants' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Most significantly, they deny that any threats were made to LGB to support the proposal for a site agreement and EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">They deny the meeting of 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The respondents deny that any action in relation to Silvestri P/L or that the events of 21 and 22 October 2003 were motivated by lack of Union membership or the non-existence of an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Rather, they were concerned with matters of safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In their opinion, Silvestri P/L was an unsatisfactory contractor in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The site was closed because of deficiencies found by WorkCover and the Council, not because of any Union action or threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The alleged conversation between Kelly and the truck driver is denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">12 The two versions of events are inconsistent in substance, cannot be reconciled and cannot stand together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">As will appear, I accept the substance of the applicants' case and reject the substance of the respondents' denials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
 
13 The principal statutory provisions are ss 170NC(1)(c), 298SC(c) and 349 of the Workplace Relations Act , and ss 45D , 45DC and 75B of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>

 Amendment of the Workplace Relations Act 
 
18 Although s 170NC and s 298SC of the Workplace Relations Act were in force during September and October 2003, they were repealed by virtue of Schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth).</sentence>

 FACTS 
 
22 The case substantially turns upon the credibility of evidence given in relation to a series of meetings and events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The point of sharpest conflict concerns 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Resolution of that conflict is critical to credibility in general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It needs to be considered in context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">23 The project at 26---28 Market Street was the construction of a residential apartment block and commercial premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The building, to be known as Sunrise Apartments, was to comprise a basement underground car park, an eight-storey building at the front and a six-storey building at the back with a courtyard in the middle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The overall cost of the project was about $16 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It was due for completion in or about December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">11 September---19 October 2003 --- Dealings between Union and LGB 
 
24 On 11 September 2003 Mr Oscar Picciau was in charge of the site pending the employment of a project manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">On 11 September 2003 he was at the site with two LGB employees, Mr Angele Srbinovski and Mr David Hill, and a demolition and excavation contractor, Mr Bruce Harris from BBI Constructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Demolition had commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The site establishment --- with an equipped shed and amenities --- was not fully set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">25 On 10 September 2003 an article about the site had been published in the Illawarra Mercury newspaper, which had been seen by Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Lane attended the site on 11 September 2003 and met Picciau, whose evidence of what took place after the introductions (which is not disputed by Lane) was as follows:
 
 
 
 "Me: 'What is the problem is there anything that I can help you with?</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">' 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Who is running the site and what is happening with the actual site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">' 
 
 Me: 'I am the assistant project manager, we are about 70 to 80 percent complete with the demolition and the site is under my control until we get a site manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">' 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Do you have a site establishment set up such as site sheds, amenities, securing the site and so forth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">' 
 
 Me: 'No we do not have a full site establishment set up we are still in the process of demolition work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 Mr Lane pointed out some issues which he claimed were safety issues on the Site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He did not explain what was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mr Lane said that the site shed did not have any power connected and the lining on the shed floor was not in good condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">As a result, I arranged to have the shed replaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 My discussion with Mr Lane continued as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mr Lane: 'I do not want any more works to proceed until these safety issues are rectified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There have been a few buildings within the Wollongong area that didn't comply to any safety regulations, such as the building across the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I hope your building isn't going to be like the site across the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Which contractors do you propose using on the site?</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 Me: 'No contracts have been issued and we have no main contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">' 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Does LGB Contracting have an EBA and are any of the workers union members?</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">' 
 
 Me: 'To the best of my knowledge, I do not know if LGB does or does not have an EBA or whether any of our employees are union members or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">' 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Have Grujoski call me so we can have a meeting to discuss any further issues relating to the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mr Lane was on Site for about an hour or an hour and a half.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">" 
 

The site across the road had been closed, to the knowledge of Picciau, for approximately two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">26 Later that day two WorkCover inspectors, one of whom was Mr Barry Childs, attended the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He had a discussion with Picciau as follows:
 
 
 
 "Mr Childs: 'You do not have your occupational health and safety policies in place yet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">' 
 
 [Picciau] : 'Our quality assurance manager, Ron McGeoch is in the process of preparing an OH&amp;S work method statement, safety reports and so forth for the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">' 
 
 Mr Childs: 'I am also concerned with types of material that are on site and it would be better if you ceased the works and clean up the site, and secure the premises after which you can continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">'" 
 
 
 
 

27 Picciau stopped the demolition work, which did not recommence until the following Monday 15 September 2003 during which time the site was cleaned up, temporary power was connected to the sheds and the site was secured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">28 Grujoski gave evidence of meeting Lane at the site on 12 September 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">That was his first meeting with Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Grujoski gives an account summarised by counsel for the applicant as follows:
 
 
 "(a) Lane says we are the union organisers for this region and we control this area; 
 
 (b) Lane demands that LGB enter into a site agreement and Enterprise Bargaining Agreement with the CFMEU; 
 
 (c) Lane demands that all contractors on the Site enter into an EBA with the CFMEU; and 
 
 (d) Lane indicates that if the demands are not met it will become 'very difficult' for LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">" 
 
 
 

29 Lane does not dispute that there was such an occasion but he does dispute that he threatened or implied a threat to disrupt the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">He denied that he said he controlled the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">He denied that he made any relevant demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He also denied suggesting an alternative demolition and excavation contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">His evidence was that he said (no doubt, amongst other things):
 
 "Everyone who comes on site must be inducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It would be a lot better if we could come to some sort of site agreement and everyone knows the ground rules before they come onto the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">" 
 
 "I would like us to sit down and talk to you about an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It would be far preferable if major contractors who were to come on site were EBA'd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">" 
 

30 There are two problems in relation to Grujoski's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The first is that he places Picciau, Srbinovski and Hill as being present, although none of those witnesses gave evidence to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">That may not be crucial as the evidence he gave was consistent with them being in the vicinity although not being actual participants in the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The second is that he produced with his affidavit a copy of a diary entry corroborating his version of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It was written on the page of the diary for 13 October 2003 rather than 12 September 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">That in itself is of no great significance but when the original was produced the page differed in some respects from that which had been produced with the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Considerable attention was paid to the issue of that diary note, both at the hearing and in submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I am not satisfied that the explanation is sinister but no completely satisfactory explanation was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Although the version given by Grujoski accords with Lane's later conduct and I do not accept much of Lane's evidence, a sufficient shadow is cast over Grujoski's evidence in relation to this meeting to cause me to put it aside, bearing in mind the Briginshaw standard of proof which is applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">31 Picciau gave evidence of another meeting with Lane on site in late September or early October.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Lane does not dispute the evidence given by Picciau, which was as follows:
 
 "Mr Lane and I had a discussion as follows: 
 
 
 Mr Lane: 'I am happy with the way you have progressed on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">' 
 ... 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Who are your contractors and have any contracts been issued to anyone?</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">' 
 
 Me: 'No contracts have been issued and we might be using contractors from Sydney due to the fact that we have worked with those contractors before and know their performance and their pricing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">' 
 
 
 Mr Lane laughed at that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 
 Mr Lane: 'Why wouldn't you use local people?</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">' 
 
 
 I cannot now recall what if any response I gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">" 
 

32 Grujoski gave evidence of two other meetings with Lane on the site prior to 20 October 2003 --- one on 18 September 2003 and another on 1 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">As to the first meeting, Grujoski says that Lane gave him two one-page documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The first was headed "New South Wales Southern Region General Construction Enterprise Bargaining Agreement" containing rates of pay for various categories of worker and details of various other payments or allowances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The second was the front sheet of what was said to be a collective bargaining agreement between LGB and employees and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Lane said that he wanted a Union EBA and a site agreement and promised to get a copy of the complete EBA to Grujoski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">There was discussion about an EBA that LGB had with the CFMEU between 1997 and 1999, which Grujoski said was not for building work, but rather for a saw-cutting operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Grujoski said that Lane said, amongst other things:
 
 "Why I say that I want a union EBA and a site agreement is I don't want any situations like across the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">" 
 

And: 
 
 "That building across the road is a complete disaster and I don't want this to result in that same manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">" 
 

There was also discussion about a Mr Rodney Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Grujoski said that Lane had referred to Fisher in an earlier discussion as a person LGB should employ to help with the early stages of the project and to assist with inductions and with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In the course of this conversation, Lane said:
 
 "I need to know what happens on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I need cooperation to be informed on who you employ on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">All contractors are to have an EBA and you must have my approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">" 
 

And:
 
 "You have got to run it by me first on who you use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">I would like to know who you use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I must approve of the contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">" 
 

On Grujoski's account he did not agree to any of Lane's demands at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">33 The parties agreed to meet again on 1 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">On that occasion, Lane brought with him and gave to Grujoski three copies of a document entitled "Collective Bargaining Agreement between LGB Contracting Pty Ltd and Employees and Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union Construction and General Division New South Wales Branch expiring 31 October 2005".</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Grujoski says that in the course of the conversation, Lane said:
 
 "I have the pleasure of submitting you these draft copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">This is what an EBA looks like and I'd like to get that signed and out of the way so we can proceed with the works or I will interrupt your works programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">We will be here for a very long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">" 
 

And: 
 
 "There's certain people that aren't welcome around here, I don't want to get my other union fellow and people to come here and disrupt the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">If we don't get this resolved we will be into problems and I will come here with Peter Primmer to disrupt the site and stop the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">" 
 

34 Grujoski says that he asked for a list of preferred contractors, which he was given by Lane, with telephone numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">There was further discussion about Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Lane agreed to give Grujoski time to consider the EBA and left saying:
 
 "If you cooperate and sign an EBA and an agreement then we shouldn't have any problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">" 
 

They agreed to meet again when Lane returned from his holidays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">35 Lane does not deny the meeting with Grujoski on these two occasions and agrees that the topics of the site agreement and the EBA were discussed and that the documents to which Grujoski refers were handed over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">However, he is not sure how the single title page for the collective agreement came to be given to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">He also agrees that there was discussion about Fisher playing a role as delegate to ensure that companies on the job were bona fide and to be a go-between between the builder, the Union and whoever was coming on to the job as a subcontractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He agrees that there was discussion about the EBA which LGB had with the CFMEU, which LGB claimed only applied to saw cutting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Lane denied making any threats of disruption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">So far as the job across the road was concerned, his evidence was that he said:
 
 "See that job over the road, that job was run by a complete shonk who has since gone bankrupt and has taken a number of players down with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">That job is still under contract and has been under construction since 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">" 
 

He denies demanding that all contractors on site have an EBA or be union approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He says he did say:
 
 "I would like us to sit down and talk to you about an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">It would be far preferable if major contractors who were to come on site were EBA'd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">" 
 

Later he said:
 
 "There is a preference for major contractors with EBA's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">" 
 

Grujoski said:
 
 "We are using serious contractors, big players and I would expect some would have enterprise agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">" 
 

Lane:
 
 "We all know the reality and nothing like all contractors would have an EBA because not all of them do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" 
 

Lane denied giving Grujoski any list of approved contractors with telephone numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">36 I accept the substance of Grujoski's evidence as to these meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">There is no doubt that Lane was seeking both a site agreement and an EBA with LGB itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">There is no doubt that he was expressing a preference for at least the major contractors to have an EBA with the Union and there is no doubt that he was seeking to have a Union nominee employed to become site delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Based upon my observations of Lane and his evidence, and my findings as to what occurred later, I am satisfied that his objective in dealing with Grujoski was to impress upon him that the Union controlled commercial building sites in Wollongong and that all contractors on the site, including LGB, should comply with Union demands in relation to a site agreement and an EBA --- fundamentally to underpin Union membership by all the individuals involved on the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I am satisfied that Lane clearly conveyed to Grujoski the message that if the Union demands were not met then there would be disruption of the job by whatever means were available and that the state of the site opposite was used as an example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Dealings between Silvestri P/L and LGB prior to 21 October 2003 
 
37 There is no difference of substance between the evidence of Antonio and Laura Silvestri and Mr Anthony Krkovski, although the precise sequence of events is doubtful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Krkovski was the newly appointed site or project manager and was in day-to-day charge of the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">He had started by 15 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Upon starting on the site Krkovski decided that the existing excavation contractor was unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">He telephoned Antonio Silvestri and asked him to come and have a look at the job and give him a price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Krkovski caused Mr Jovan Matlioski, a contracts administrator employed by LGB and normally based in Sydney, to make inquiries as to competence from others for whom Silvestri P/L had worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The responses were favourable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Antonio Silvestri went to the site, met Krkovski and surveyed the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">There was some discussion about prices which were to be charged for various items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Antonio Silvestri estimated about three to four weeks would be required to carry out the excavation work, depending upon the type and quantity of rock on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Krkovski had hoped that it would take two weeks for bulk excavation and one week for detailed excavation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Laura Silvestri prepared a price for machine and trucks, quoting per hour, except that in relation to both concrete and filling the quote was per load, and sent it to LGB by facsimile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Antonio Silvestri refused to lower his prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Krkovski accepted the prices and on or about 16 October 2003 it was agreed that Silvestri P/L would carry out all the excavation work that was required at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It was agreed that the job would start on the following Monday, 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Antonio Silvestri was unable to start on that day as he was still working on a different site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">There is no doubt there was some communication between Antonio Silvestri and Krkovski on 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">There is a question as to the content of it which need not be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">20 October 2003 
 
38 The applicants' witnesses speak of a visit by Lane and Primmer to the site shed on 20 October 2003 making threats of disruption if Antonio Silvestri commenced work on the site, linked with the fact that he was not a Union member and that Silvestri P/L did not have an EBA with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Lane and Primmer deny that there was such a meeting on 20 October 2003 and deny making threats of that kind on any occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">39 I am satisfied that such an occasion did occur on 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Evidence to that effect was given by five witnesses for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Krkovski had only recently made the decision to employ Silvestri P/L in lieu of the previous excavation subcontractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">At the time he gave evidence, he was not employed by LGB and provided no affidavit in advance of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Matlioski was a contracts administrator employed by LGB based in Sydney who was visiting the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">He was no longer employed by LGB at the time he gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Matlioski was accompanied to the site that day by one Mr Branco Riklovski, a draftsman employed by LGB based in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">He was not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Because of the absence of that witness, counsel for the respondents sought to rely upon the principle in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Picciau was the Assistant Project Manager employed by LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Srbinovski was a leading hand employed by LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Hill was a labourer employed by LGB who was no longer employed at the time he gave evidence and had not been employed since April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">There were inconsistencies in the detail of the evidence given by these witnesses and there is no contemporaneous note by any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">There is a reasonably contemporaneous note by Matlioski but it appears to have been produced as a result of a request by the Building Industry Taskforce which was investigating Antonio Silvestri's complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However, each witness clearly identified and gave evidence about the same occurrence on the Monday, which was the day before the drama at the site on Tuesday 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Given what occurred on 21 October 2003, it is most unlikely that all of the witnesses would have been mistaken about the timing of the meeting with the Union officials about which they gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">40 The WorkCover inspector, Childs, recorded in his notebook that, when he met Krkovski and Antonio Silvestri on the morning of 21 October 2003, Krkovski stated that:
 
 "The issue started yesterday when they attended" [the Union and] "arrived on site Dave Kelly &amp; Mick Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Issues raised by Union 1) Why was the excavation company changed ..." 
 

Whilst Krkovski had obviously mistaken the names of Primmer and Kelly, this was significant independent and contemporaneous evidence confirming the version of the witnesses for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">41 I see no reason to doubt the honesty of any of the witnesses called by the applicants as to this incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Three had left the employ of LGB at the time they gave evidence and clearly had nothing to gain one way or the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The newly-appointed site manager would be expected to have a good recall of the events and appeared to do so given the difficulties occasioned by the considerable lapse of time between the events and giving evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">He presented as a competent and intelligent person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Matlioski appeared to be an honest and competent witness whose nearly contemporaneous note supported the existence of the occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Hill was, as his background would suggest, of limited sophistication and was, at times, quite inarticulate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Apart from a tendency to agree, perhaps too readily, to matters that were put to him, his honesty could not be questioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Srbinovski, although still employed by LGB, appeared to me to be an honest and reliable witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The same could be said of Picciau.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It needs to be borne in mind that LGB itself had little to gain from involvement in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It is suggested that the proceeding assists LGB in dealing with or avoiding any claim from Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">In my view, that possibility would rate fairly low on the scale for a developer compared with becoming embroiled in an adversary proceeding against these respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">42 The evidence given by Lane and Primmer was far from convincing, both generally and in relation to this occurrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Lane appeared to be an intelligent witness who, nonetheless, gave indications of both arrogance and belligerence consistent with the evidence given by witnesses for the applicants as to what occurred on this day and other days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Primmer gave evidence in an unconvincing fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">They were both unwilling to make any concession or admission of conduct that might inculpate either of them or the Union in unlawful or inappropriate conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">43 Apart from pointing to inconsistencies in the detail of the evidence given by the witnesses for the applicants, counsel for the respondents relied heavily upon evidence which was called as to a visit by Primmer to other sites on 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The evidence establishes that Primmer was present at a site safety inspection at a company called South Coast Equipment elsewhere in Wollongong from 7.00 am on 20 October 2003 for between two and three hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Primmer also gave evidence that he attended two other sites in the afternoon including one in Nowra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Even if that were correct, there was time to have attended the site inspection at South Coast Equipment and the meeting at the LGB site before attending the other places.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The site inspection at South Coast Equipment may cast doubt upon the recollections of some of the witnesses as to the time of the visit by the Union officials to the site but does not, in my opinion, cast any doubt upon the visit occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">None of the witnesses for the applicants give any support to the evidence of Primmer and Lane that a similar meeting (but with no threats) had taken place on site previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">44 The next issue is the nature of the objections to the engagement of Silvestri P/L and the threats made in relation to that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">It is clear enough, from the versions given by Lane and Primmer of the conversations they said occurred on the earlier occasion, that they voiced strong objection to the engagement of Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">They contend that this was based upon Antonio Silvestri's safety record rather than his lack of involvement with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">They deny that threats were made as to disruption if it were employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">It is also clear enough that, on that and other occasions, they were prepared to nominate contractors who might be used in lieu of Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Notwithstanding the inconsistencies between the versions pointed to by counsel for the respondents, I am satisfied that it was made quite clear on 20 October 2003 to Krkovski, who was the decision maker, that the objection to Silvestri P/L and Antonio Silvestri was based upon the fact that the company did not have an EBA with the Union, that Antonio Silvestri was not a member of the Union and that only Union-approved contractors would be tolerated on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">I am further satisfied that each of Primmer and Lane threatened serious disruption to the project if Silvestri P/L started work on the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">45 I regard Krkovski as a reliable witness as to the substance of what took place on this occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">He was the person in charge and responsible for what was occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">He had not met Lane or Primmer previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In the first place, Lane was quite clear that LGB would not be allowed to use Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">His explanation was that:
 
 "He is rough, he doesn't pay his contractors, he is shonky and he doesn't have an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">" 
 

Lane said that he wanted Krkovski to use someone who had an EBA and when he was asked "who" his response was "John Hart from J &amp; D Excavations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Lane said that if Silvestri P/L was used he would close the site down and cause disruptions to the site --- he stated that the same thing had happened to a building site across the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He would cause stoppages and delays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">He, Lane, would drive his car across the driveway and stop trucks from entering or leaving the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">That evidence should be accepted as to the gist of the message conveyed by Lane and Primmer to LGB on 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Neither the variations in the other versions nor the absence of Riklovski lead me to take a different view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Riklovski was very much a bit player.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">His evidence is of little account in the scheme of things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">46 The rejection of the evidence of Lane and Primmer about the events of 20 October 2003 has significance beyond those events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The conflict with the evidence of the other witnesses was too great and the denials of Lane and Primmer too emphatic to be accounted for by normal mistaken memory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Conscious or unconscious reconstruction of events is indicated and, on either view, that significantly shakes the credit of both witnesses as to the other events that are in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">21 October 2003 
 
47 The events of 21 October 2003 have been extensively canvassed in the written and oral submissions on behalf of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">A chronology has been prepared by the parties, which has some common ground but much is in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Evidence was given about those events by the parties who gave evidence concerning the events of 20 October 2003 (except for Matlioski), together with a truck driver Mr Vangel Veljanov, the WorkCover Inspector Childs, Grujoski, Antonio and Laura Silvestri and the respondent Kelly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">In addition to those parties, local police, officers of the Council and a crew from the local television station all attended during the morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">No evidence was called from those sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It is not necessary to set out all that happened on that day or to resolve all conflicts and inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The basic conflict which requires resolving is whether (as the applicants contend) the Union officials attended and took action to close the site in order to carry out the threats that had been made the day before in retaliation for LGB permitting Silvestri P/L to work on site, or whether (as contended on behalf of the respondents) the Union officials attended to inspect for safety concerns, justified by the events which happened, and that the site was shut down by the Council and WorkCover rather than the Union officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">I am satisfied that the applicants' version is correct in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">48 I have already discussed the credibility of the witnesses to the events of 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Many were involved again on 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">There were others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Veljanov was obviously an honest witness with no personal interest in the outcome who endeavoured to give evidence to the best of his recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Laura Silvestri has an interest in the outcome of the proceeding, but I was satisfied that she was an honest witness and was generally reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Antonio Silvestri is also interested in the outcome of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">He was clearly resentful and somewhat emotional as to what befell him in connection with this job, and with the Union generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Evidence from the other witnesses indicates that he was so affected on 21 October 2003 and made his feelings known to the Union officials and others in no uncertain manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">However, generally speaking, I have no hesitation in accepting his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It had the ring of truth and was consistent with the evidence of others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">He had good reason to recall what occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The credit of Grujoski was attacked, principally (but not only) based upon alterations to the diary entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Suffice to say at the moment that I prefer the evidence of Grujoski to that of Lane as to the substance of the events of 21 October 2003 where they are in conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">I generally accept the evidence of WorkCover Inspector Childs, particularly where it is reflected in his notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">My findings as to the substance of what occurred, based upon the oral and written evidence, follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Doubts as to the precise sequence of events are not important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">49 Antonio Silvestri commenced operating the machine on site at about 6.30 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Trucks were coming onto the site, being loaded with spoil and then leaving the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">One was being operated by Veljanov.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Two flagmen (Hill and Srbinovski) were operating to direct traffic and watch for pedestrians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">There were pedestrian signs and barriers on the footpath.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The system was the same as, or similar to, that which had been in operation with the previous subcontractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">50 At about 9.30 am Lane telephoned Grujoski and told him that Antonio Silvestri was not allowed on the site and sought to arrange a meeting for LGB to sign a site agreement and EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Shortly thereafter, Veljanov reversed into the site to pick up another load.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Lane arrived at the site in his car, got out of the car and told Veljanov that he could leave with his load but not to come back because "the job is stopped".</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">By then, Kelly and Primmer had arrived and approached Veljanov.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Having identified themselves as being from the building union, Veljanov said:
 
 "What have we done wrong?</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Have we done anything wrong mate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">" 
 

Kelly replied:
 
 "No, no, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">You haven't done anything wrong, we don't want Tony Silvestri to do the job here, we want to get some bigger people to do the job here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">" 
 

51 Once Veljanov had left, Lane parked his car across the vehicular entrance to the site, so preventing the ingress and egress of trucks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The precise sequence of events is somewhat confused but consideration of the evidence of Krkovski, Veljanov and Hill indicates that the first substantive conversation with Lane at the site involved Krkovski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Lane made it clear that he was in attendance to carry out the threat that he had made the day before if Antonio Silvestri started on the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">He was present because his instructions of the day before had not been carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Amongst the objections that he had to Antonio Silvestri was that he did not have an EBA with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Lane refused to move his car from blocking the driveway, notwithstanding a direct request that he do so by Hill on behalf of Grujoski and by Antonio Silvestri.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">He also declined to move the vehicle when requested by a Council ranger who had appeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Notwithstanding direct requests on the part of both Hill and Antonio Silvestri, the Council ranger declined to take any steps to force Lane to remove the vehicle, not being prepared to act against a union official.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Lane only moved the car later in the morning when directed to do so by a police officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">After the car was removed the Union officials continued to stand at the entrance barring the movement of vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">52 When Veljanov returned to the site with his truck, he was unable to gain entrance as Lane's car was still blocking the driveway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Lane said that no trucks were to be allowed into the site because the job was stopped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Veljanov then had a conversation with Primmer and Kelly, who were standing with Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The conversation was as follows:
 
 
 
 " [Veljanov] : 'What's happened mate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Are we gonna start working or what?</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">' 
 
 Mr Primmer: 'We try to do the best for you people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'What do you mean do best for us?</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">We got a nice little job here, we don't hurt anybody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">We try to work ourselves as hard as we can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">We're trying to make a few dollars to feed our family, you take my bread from my hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">What are you guys doing here?</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Please, let us go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">What's wrong with you guys?</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">' 
 
 Mr Primmer: 'No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">It's got to be a union member working on this site here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'Why?</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'Mate, we're wanting big people here, like Cleary brothers, Effective Services and J&amp;D.' 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Mr Kelly said that I started laughing at him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">
 
 
 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'Why them?</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'They joined the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'What do you mean joined the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">I'm in a union, but what's making different?</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Tony Silvestri paid his tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'He's got to be a member of the union, otherwise he's not allowed to work on this site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'For a start, Cleary brothers they're not interested when it's little fish, they're after big subdivision, they can use their own material, road base, because they have their own quarry, they can use the concrete they made themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">They don't have interest here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'Well if not Cleary's, we've got Effective Services, they are pretty big, J&amp;D, he's pretty big, he's a member in the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'Get him mate, that's all I can say to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">As far as I know, we haven't done anything wrong here on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">We haven't abused anybody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">What's wrong, explain yourself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'That's the reason mate, you're not a member of the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">' 
 
 [Veljanov] : 'I am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">That's my badge here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">' 
 
 Mr Kelly: 'Well you're Transport Workers Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">'" 
 
 
 
 

53 Two alleged safety issues arose that morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The Union officials claimed that they were concerned about the safety of the traffic arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">They professed to be concerned about pedestrians and vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">I reject the contention that they were genuinely concerned about safety in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">The same arrangements had been in force for the previous demolition and excavation subcontractor with no intervention from the Union or anybody else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The criticisms that were advanced in evidence did not stand scrutiny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The Union officials were mistaken as to the number of persons involved in traffic control and their duties and were wrong about the nature and location of the signs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Furthermore, it was not of direct concern to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The Union had no role to play in relation to traffic or pedestrians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">It may have had a legitimate concern if there were any effect upon the safety of building workers on the site, but there was no evidence of that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">It was a pretext for disruption of the carrying out of the contract by Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">It turned out to be an effective intervention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">LGB had prepared and lodged a traffic management plan some weeks before, but the Council had not dealt with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Notwithstanding the fact that the site had been operating for some weeks without any approval, in accordance with the plan lodged, the Council intervened to stop work until a plan was approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">There was no exploration of the question as to whether the Union officials knew of this circumstance prior to their appearance on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The fact that the arrangements ultimately approved by the Council differed somewhat from those operating on 21 October 2003 does not establish that the latter were unsafe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The WorkCover inspector also pointed out some damage to the footpath and deficiencies with the hoardings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">These were not strictly within his domain but, rather, issues for the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">LGB was required to attend to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">They raised no safety issues so far as the work being carried out on site was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">54 The other issue, which received attention on that morning and as to which a body of evidence was directed, was the state of Antonio Silvestri's machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Primmer, who had some relevant experience and was enlisted by Lane for that reason, after some toing-and-froing, was permitted to inspect the excavator and drew attention to items that he claimed were defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">I am satisfied that none of them amounted to a safety issue on the site on that morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">To the extent that rectification was required in due course, there is nothing to suggest that it could not have been attended to in a timely fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">What is more, from a practical point of view, the only person at risk from the items concerned was Antonio Silvestri who was operating the machine on his own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">The WorkCover inspector did not give any directions in relation to the machine, although Antonio Silvestri later reported to him the steps that he was taking in relation to the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Indeed, the WorkCover inspector did not stop the job on any account on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Such intervention as there was was by the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The state of Antonio Silvestri's machine was not a bona fide safety concern but, rather, was a pretext for disruption of work on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">55 I reject the proposition that the Union officials were bona fide in investigating breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) and the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2001, even if they had a proper role in relation to this site where no members were working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The appropriateness of such a role has not been demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">56 At about 1.30 pm there was a meeting involving LGB personnel, Lane and Primmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Grujoski and Picciau place it in the site shed attended by Grujoski, Krkovski, Picciau, Lane and Primmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Krkovski gave evidence of a similar conversation but placed it outside the sheds with other people present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">I am satisfied that the evidence of Picciau, corroborated by Grujoski, should be accepted in that respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">During the meeting, Lane and Primmer made it clear that they would not tolerate Antonio Silvestri being on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Silvestri P/L would need to be replaced by a contractor recommended by the Union with an EBA with the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The contractor J&amp;D Excavations was nominated after some inquiry by Primmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">There was a threat of disruption including picketing if this did not take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">It was also made clear that the Union was pursuing an EBA and a site agreement with LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Arrangements were made for Krkovski to attend the Union offices at 9.00 am on the following morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">57 During the course of the afternoon it was agreed between Grujoski and Krkovski that, because of the Union demands, Silvestri P/L would be replaced with another contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Krkovski said he made the decision and was intimidated by the Union attitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">His focus was on getting the job done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Picciau and Hill gave evidence that that decision was conveyed to Antonio Silvestri on that afternoon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">I think they must be mistaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">Antonio Silvestri, who would have the best recollection of that matter, gave no such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Krkovski conceded in cross-examination that he could have conveyed the decision to Antonio Silvestri on that afternoon, although he had no independent recollection of having done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">58 Antonio Silvestri went to the WorkCover office to meet Childs concerning the excavator on the afternoon of 21 October 2003 and followed up with a visit on 22 October 2003 during which he handed Childs a document dated 21 October 2003 setting out his position as far as the machine was concerned and contending that there was no existing safety problem with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">A correction to that document was sent on 4 November 2003 --- the mistake was obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">22 October 2003 
 
59 Antonio Silvestri's version of 22 October 2003 is that Krkovski telephoned him between 8.00 am and 8.30 am on 22 October 2003 and arranged to meet him at the site later in the morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Krkovski attended the Union offices at Wollongong at 9.00 am on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">He says that he met with Primmer, Lane, Kelly and Fisher and that he was told to use contractors recommended by the Union and, if not, there would be stoppages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Lane says that the conversation was with Krkovski and a Mr Ron McGeogh concerning occupational health and safety matters and that Kelly and Primmer were not present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">McGeogh had been engaged by LGB as to occupational health and safety issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">He was not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Primmer and Kelly deny being present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Fisher was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Krkovski accepted that there was a meeting involving McGeogh but placed it on another later day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">He was firm in his evidence that the meeting on 22 October 2003 was as he had described it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">It included threats of stoppages such as there had been on other sites in Wollongong and involved a demand for use of Union recommended subcontractors as well as a site EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The absence of Krkovski from the site that morning for a meeting with the Union was known to others on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">I accept that it took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">It is less clear who was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">I am satisfied to the requisite standard that Lane was present and that he made the threats and demands to which Krkovski referred, no matter what else might have been discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I make no finding that either Primmer or Kelly was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">60 On that morning, Antonio Silvestri told Childs that his contract with LGB had been terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The sequence of events as to the termination is not entirely clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Krkovski gave instructions to Matlioski to draft a letter to Silvestri P/L terminating the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">The first communication was by facsimile at 9.42 am and was signed by Matlioski which, omitting formal parts, was as follows:
 
 "Please be advised due to unforeseen circumstances and obligations that have arisen on the above mentioned project, we have no alternative, but to terminate our hire agreement of the 25 ton excavator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">
 
 Therefore, can you please kindly organize for your machinery to be removed from the site, by the end of today Wednesday the 22 nd of October by 4pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">
 
 We will contact you should we require your services in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">" 
 

61 That was followed by another facsimile, again signed by Matlioski, at 10.11 am which, omitting formal parts, was as follows:
 
 "A&amp;L Silvestri have been terminated from providing LGB Contracting Excavation work at 26---28 Market street Wollongong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Work was stopped by the CFMEU on the 21 st of October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">A opinion from one of the Union delegates was given that Tony Silvestri's excavation was deemed unsafe, and that defects were spotted on numerous places, and in particular of safety pins near the bucket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">
 
 The CFMEU used heavy handed and intimidating approach to Tony Silvestri to shut down his equipment, as witnessed by our Site Manager Tony Krkovski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">" 
 

62 At 1.11 pm on that day, McAneny Lawyers from Woonona, near Wollongong, forwarded a letter to LGB referring to the earlier communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">That letter was in the following terms:
 
 "We act for A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd. 
 
 We refer to your letters of the 22 October 2003 wherein you inter alia purport to unilaterally terminate the Hire Agreement with our client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">
 
 We note that the reason given was that the 'Union delegate gave an opinion that Tony Silvestri's excavation was deemed unsafe, and that defects were spotted on numerous places and in particular of safety pins near the bucket' 
 
 Our client denies these allegations and confirms that the company is ready, willing and able to comply with their obligations pursuant to the Hire Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">Further as you are aware WorkCover was called to the site and Barry Childs the Chief WorkCover inspector confirmed that there were no safety issues requiring addressing in respect to the work of our client company or Mr Silvestri personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">
 
 Our client has rectified the minor matter referred to by the Union in respect to the pins near the bucket and is ready to continue the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">
 
 We note that you require our client's machinery to be removed to enable the Union appointed contractor J &amp; D Earthmovers to commence work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">
 
 If you do not allow our client to comply with the terms of the Hire Agreement we are instructed to commence proceedings in Court to protect our clients rights and if appropriate sue for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">" 
 

63 At 2.42 pm a handwritten note signed by Krkovski was sent by LGB by facsimile to Silvestri P/L in the following terms:
 
 "A &amp; L Silvestri were made to remove there equipment from 26---28 Market St Wollongong The reason for this was made clear to us from the local CFMEU, that if we did not have A &amp; L Silvestri removed from the site and if we didn't employ a recommded contractor that the CFMEU specified we (LGB Contracting) were threatend with shutdowns &amp; disputes which were made by the local CFMEU on the 21-10-03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">We LGB Contracting have not had any problems with A &amp; L Silvestri performing or undertaking particular works that need to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">He performed professional worked in with our specified requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">" 
 

64 The evidence of Antonio and Laura Silvestri, Matlioski, Krkovski, Lane and Childs contain some inconsistencies as to the timing of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">It is not necessary to resolve all of those inconsistencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The end result was that the contract with Silvestri P/L was terminated by LGB and Antonio Silvestri was ordered to remove the excavator from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The excavator was removed early on the following morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">I am satisfied that the handwritten note by Krkovski reflected the true reasons for the termination of the services of Silvestri P/L, the earlier communications having been drafted in more guarded terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">23 October 2003 
 
65 On 23 October 2003 Antonio Silvestri telephoned the CFMEU office in Sydney to complain about the events of 21 and 22 October 2003 and a copy of the second communication signed by Matlioski on 22 October 2003, together with the handwritten document of Krkovski of the same date, were sent to the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">He subsequently had a conversation with the State President of the CFMEU Construction and General Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">In response, the CFMEU forwarded to Antonio Silvestri a copy of a letter of 28 October 2003 written to McGeogh which, omitting formal parts, was as follows:
 
 "Following our telephone conversations of the 23 rd and 24 th of October and receiving copies of correspondence forwarded to A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd by LGB Contracting Pty Ltd I have discussed with our Wollongong officials the concerns and allegations contained in said correspondence and concluded that: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The excavation plant being operated on the 26 Market Street Wollongong project did not meet operational requirements and relevant Acts and regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Our officials drew this to the attention of the site manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">There was no approved traffic management plan in place 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The above was accepted as accurate by WorkCover Authority Inspector Barry Childs who was contacted by our officials and was present on site during their visit 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Our officials deny that they demanded that the A&amp;L Silvestri Pty Ltd contract be terminated 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Our officials deny that they demanded that LGB Contracting Pty Ltd were to engage subcontractors recommended by them or the project would be industrially disrupted 
 
 
 
 This union takes seriously the allegations made which are damaging to the good name of the CFMEU and seeks a meeting to resolve the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">
 
 Our Assistant Secretary Peter Zaboyak will involve himself in any future meeting in this regard and it would be hoped that LGB Contracting Pty Ltd would be represented by its senior management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">" 
 

66 The applicants' case, based on the evidence of Grujoski, is that there was a meeting on the site on 23 October 2003 between Grujoski, Krkovski, Picciau, McGeogh and Lane at which LGB agreed to pay a site allowance but refused to agree to an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">Grujoski gave evidence that Lane made further threats of disruption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Lane denies the meeting but gave evidence of a meeting with Grujoski in a caf&eacute; in Wollongong with no other parties present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Neither Krkovski nor Picciau gave evidence as to the site meeting and McGeogh was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">There undoubtedly was a meeting between Grujoski and Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">I cannot be satisfied as to where or when that took place or precisely what was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">It is clear enough that the topics of a site allowance and an EBA were discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">I cannot be satisfied to the requisite degree, bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings, that there were any further threats issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">In one sense, of course, no further threats were necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">A demonstration had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Furthermore, it is clear enough that ultimately Grujoski agreed to a site allowance but did not agree to an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">It would have been apparent to all concerned by then that Antonio Silvestri was pursuing his rights, legal proceedings were likely to ensue and an investigation by the Building Industry Taskforce was on the cards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">On an occasion after 21 October 2003, Lane warned Grujoski not to speak to the Building Industry Taskforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">67 On 23 October 2003, Primmer told Veljanov that he would be employed by J &amp; D Excavations and should turn up for work at the site on 24 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">He did so and was engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">LIABILITY 
 Section 170NC Workplace Relations Act 
 
68 There is no doubt that Lane was concerned to have LGB enter an EBA with the Union along the lines of the document provided by him to Grujoski prior to 20 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">That was clearly to be an agreement pursuant to Div 2 of Pt VIB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">That objective was actively pursued by Lane from the first meeting with Picciau to the last meeting with Grujoski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">It follows from the findings already made that Lane made a number of explicit threats to disrupt the progress of work on the site if an EBA were not entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The threats were general and particular.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">In other words, disruption would occur by whatever means were available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Some means were mentioned, including obstruction and picketing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">There was no threat of industrial action as such because there were no Union members on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The reality of the threats of other action was backed up on several occasions by reference to the fate of the site across the road, which had remained closed for a long period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">It does not matter why that site was closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">The reference to that fact was significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The threats were also backed up by conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">The first visit by Lane to the site was followed within hours by a visit from two WorkCover inspectors as a result of which the site was closed for several days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">What occurred on 21 October 2003 was also a striking example of the reality of the threats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">The intervention by the Council again led to the closure of the site for some days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">It is no answer to say that there were legitimate reasons on each occasion for the site ultimately being closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">It was important that the power to give effect to disruption by whatever means were at hand was demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">On 21 October 2003 Lane took direct action by blocking vehicular access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Primmer, in effect, forced his way into an inspection of Antonio Silvestri's machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Whilst action on 21 October 2003 was primarily aimed at Silvestri P/L, it was also a potent demonstration of the reality of the threats made by Lane to LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">69 The threat of disruption was a threat of "other action" ( National Tertiary Education Industry Union v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 441 ; (2002) 117 FCR 114 at [95] ; Laing v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCA 1018 at [7] and [12]---[13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">It can safely be concluded that Lane's intent in making the threats was to coerce the officers of LGB into agreeing to an EBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">The threat of disruption to work on the project by any available means was pressure that was illegitimate and unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">LGB had completion of a project of some $16 million at stake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Any disruption to progress would have significant adverse financial consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It was clear enough that the threats also envisaged unlawful action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Threats of picketing were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">There would appear to be no lawful basis for picketing in relation to this site (cf Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers --- Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited (1993) 42 FCR 452 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ at 456---458, although on different legislation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Unlawful conduct had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The direct action by Lane and Primmer on 21 October 2003 fell into that category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">The conduct in breach of s 45D and the inducement of breach of contract to be found were unlawful as well as illegitimate and unconscionable.</sentence>

70 I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that either Primmer or Kelly was involved in threats or conduct aimed at securing an EBA with LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The involvement of Primmer on 20 and 21 October 2003 was aimed at Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">He had knowledge of machine operation that Lane did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Kelly was very much a bit player.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that Primmer or Kelly was present at any relevant meeting after 21 October 2003 or that, if either of them were present, that he was responsible for any relevant threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">71 The next question is whether either or both of CFMEU and CFMEU NSW are liable for the conduct of Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">The leading Full Court authority as to that question in relation to these provisions is Hanley v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 1188 ; (2000) 100 FCR 530, particularly at [48]---[85].</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">It is not necessary to set that passage out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Lane's conduct was within the scope of his employment and his inferred actual and apparent authority as an officer of CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">He was not on a frolic of his own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">He was accompanied by other officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Meetings took place at the Union office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The objective of entering into an EBA with LGB was a normal Union objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The position in relation to CFMEU NSW is not quite so clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Lane is a conference delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The later correspondence with the State President of CFMEU NSW did not repudiate his authority and it described those concerned collectively as "our Wollongong officials".</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">The draft EBA proffered by Lane was with the CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">I am satisfied that he represented both organisations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">72 In my opinion, consistently with the reasons of the Full Court in Hanley [2000] FCA 1188 ; 100 FCR 530, each of CFMEU and CFMEU NSW was liable for breach of s 170NC by reason of the actions of Lane, both under the general law and pursuant to s 349 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">I am also satisfied that Lane and those organisations can all be liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The reasoning of Merkel J in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd [2001] FCA 456 ; 109 FCR 378 at [45] ---[47] to that effect receives support from the decision of the High Court in Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Section 298SC Workplace Relations Act 
 
73 This contravention is based upon the statements by Kelly to Veljanov on 21 October 2003:

And:
 
 "That's the reason mate, you're not a member of the union.</sentence>

<sentence id="s531">74 There are some questions as to the proper construction of the section.</sentence>

<sentence id="s533">There is no direct authority in favour of that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">It is submitted that the reasoning in relation to other sections included in Pt 10A would be applicable (cf BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 at [77] ; Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482 at [70] ---[78]).</sentence>

<sentence id="s536">The presence of s 4(7) also tends against it.</sentence>

 "conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's membership or non-membership of an organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">" 
 

76 In my opinion, that hook is not available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The statements by Kelly to Veljanov were an explanation of, or commentary upon, what was occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">They were answers to inquiries with no intent or purpose as such relating to the membership of the Union either by Veljanov or Antonio Silvestri.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">That conclusion is assisted by bearing in mind that Kelly was only a casual participant in the events, having been brought along by Primmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">77 Even if it were not for Div 2 of Pt 10A , I would have been inclined to construe s 298SC as requiring a greater connection between the false or misleading representation and the obligation than established by these facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Section 45D Trade Practices Act 
 
78 The factual findings that I have made require further findings that: 
 
 (1) Lane and Primmer, on 20 and 21 October 2003, engaged in conduct that hindered and prevented LGB from acquiring services from Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Threats and verbal intimidation, as well as physical interference, can constitute hindering or preventing the supply or acquisition of services ( Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish (1980) 29 ALR 228; (1980) 43 FLR 129; J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ at 459---460).</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Services for these purposes include benefits to be provided under a contract for the performance of work ( Trade Practices Act , s 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, in any event, the conduct could not extend beyond the blocking of the driveway by Lane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">That is too limited a view of the situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">The aim of Lane and Primmer was to prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out any work on site by LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">They succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Work was stopped and the contract was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">The blocking of the driveway was a small step toward that objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">It was not of great significance in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">It was significant in the wider context by demonstrating the extent to which Union officials would go to target Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">(2) The conduct was engaged in for the purpose and would have, or be likely to have, the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">It is enough if one of the purposes of engaging in the conduct was the proscribed purpose (s 45D(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">A purpose of the conduct was plainly to inflict such injury to Silvestri P/L that it would enter into an EBA with the Union and Antonio Silvestri would become a Union member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">The evidence as to what Lane, Primmer and Kelly said to LGB employees, consistently with the evidence of Antonio Silvestri, was that this was not an isolated instance of pursuit of Antonio Silvestri by the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">That circumstance gives colour to the particular facts relied upon in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">This is not a case, such as J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452, where damage was collateral in the sense that, although predictable, the infliction of harm or damage was not a purpose in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">Here, the two were inextricably linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">It is significant in this, and a number of other respects, that no endeavour was made by the Union to establish the genuineness of the complaints made by its officials about the safety record and commercial morality of Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Loss or damage to Silvestri P/L was inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">"Substantial" in the context of s 45D means real or of substance rather than large ( Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 27 ALR 367; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348; Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104 at 140).</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Being prevented from carrying out a contract for reward is substantial in this sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">The arrangement between Antonio Silvestri and LGB was that Silvestri P/L would provide those services necessary to carry out the whole of the excavation work required on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">Preventing that outcome would cause substantial loss or damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">

79 No submission was made that, if the facts were as alleged by the applicants, then Lane and Primmer did not act in concert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">They plainly did on both 20 and 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">It was submitted that, in any event, there was no sufficient evidence that Kelly acted in concert in the relevant sense or that he had the requisite intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">I reject that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">I have referred to the limited role played by Kelly on 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Nonetheless, he was an active participant in the events of that day aimed (inter alia) at Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">The evidence of what he said is sufficient to buttress the inference, which would, in any event, be available, that he was well aware that one purpose of what took place was to prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out any work on the site pursuant to the arrangements that it had with LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">He was an active principal participant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Even if he were not, he would be picked up by s 75B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">80 That gives rise to the issue of the liability of the Union for these breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The principles applying to a union's direct liability for breach of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act are broadly similar to those discussed in Hanley [2000] FCA 1188 ; 100 FCR 530, substituting s 45DC and s 75B of the Trade Practices Act for s 349 of the Workplace Relations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">The Union argues that s 45DC was not pleaded and that reliance upon it is not open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The applicants do not accept that it needed to be pleaded or that failure to plead it has had any adverse evidentiary or forensic consequences to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Whether s 45DC should be pleaded is a difficult question, somewhat similar to that as to whether s 51A of the Trade Practices Act should be pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">However, on any view, the intention to rely upon it should be made clear in some way to avoid forensic disadvantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Whether or not the section should have been pleaded, reliance upon it by the applicants was flagged in time for any adverse consequence to have been cured by the Union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">It can be taken that all of the available evidence relevant to that provision has been led.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">No adjournment to lead further evidence was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">The question of costs can be left open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">81 In my opinion, s 45DC is clearly applicable and catches both CFMEU and CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Lane and Primmer were officials and members of the organisations in the way previously discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">No attempt was made to rely upon s 45DD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">I note that there is a conflict between the respondents as to this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">If s 45DC is applied, Lane and Primmer are relieved of liability for damages for the breaches (s 45DC(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">82 It is unnecessary to explore the difficulties in the way of establishing liability in the Union for this particular offence, absent s 349 (cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (2006) 157 FCR 162).</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Inducing breach of contract 
 
83 I find that the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L was to carry out the whole of the excavation works required at the site for the works being conducted by LGB, subject to implied terms as to competence and progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">The fact that the remuneration was to be calculated on a per hour or per load basis does not detract from that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">84 It is quite clear that each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly knew that Silvestri P/L had been engaged to do the excavation work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">The opening exchange on 20 October 2003 showed that Lane was aware that the existing contractor had been sacked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Lane and Primmer knew of Antonio Silvestri's proposed involvement on 20 October 2003 and each of them saw Antonio Silvestri working on the site on 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">It was obvious that that was the result of a contract for reward with LGB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Silvestri P/L was not a charitable organisation and LGB was not a mendicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">It is not necessary to prove that Lane, Primmer and Kelly had knowledge of the precise terms of the agreement ( J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley [1965] AC 269 per Lord Pearce at 332F---G; Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 at 293).</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The findings that I have already made involve each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly in deliberately taking steps to hinder or prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out its contract with LGB and were, in fact, intended to cause Silvestri P/L and Antonio Silvestri to be banned from the site and the contract to be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">There could not be a clearer case than this of interference with contractual relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">There was no attempt to pursue a defence of justification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">(See, generally, Williams v Hursey [1959] HCA 51 ; (1959) 103 CLR 30; Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 26; Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Australian Federation of Air Pilots (1989) 95 ALR 211; and Odco Pty Ltd 29 FCR 104 and the authorities referred to in those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">) 
 
85 Each of the individual respondents was a full time official of either the CFMEU or CFMEU NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Each was engaged in what may broadly be called union business on the days in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">No one was on a frolic of his own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">For relevant purposes, officers of each organisation were cooperating or acting in concert to achieve a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The conduct of each was in the course of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">Each organisation is liable on ordinary principles of vicarious liability in tort ( New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511 per Gleeson CJ at [40]---[41]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">86 I reject the submission that the interference with contract was limited to the couple of hours for which the car was parked across the vehicular access to the site on 21 October 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">It follows from the findings previously made that the intention of the officials of the Union was to ensure that the contract was terminated and that Silvestri P/L did not return to the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Whilst closure of the site on 21 October 2003 might be directly attributed to the Council, the closure of the site for that reason was not the effective cause of the termination of the contract with Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">That result was achieved by the concerted action of the Union officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Summary of liability 
 
87 Liability can be summarised as follows:
 
 (1) Lane, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 170NC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">(2) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 45D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">(3) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW induced a breach of the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">
 REMEDIES 
 
88 Penalties are sought in relation to the breach of s 170NC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">No penalty is sought in relation to breach of s 45D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Damages are sought for breach of s 45D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">Damages are sought for inducing breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">The damages, being awarded on tortious principles, would seem to be the same as those appropriate in this case for breach of s 45D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">No claim is made for exemplary damages ( Musca v Astle Corporation Pty Ltd (1988) 80 ALR 251; Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 10 ; (2003) 56 NSWLR 298; (2003) 197 ALR 626).</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">89 Evidence and submissions as to damages are complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">A further hearing on penalties will be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">I will make no declarations or orders until all issues have been determined (cf Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers' Federation v Employment Advocate [2001] FCA 1443 ; (2001) 114 FCR 22 at [7] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The proceeding will stand over to a date to be fixed.</sentence>
