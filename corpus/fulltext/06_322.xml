<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicants commenced these proceedings on 24 February 2006 and in the originating application sought interlocutory relief directed to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicants sought six separate orders restraining the respondent in the terms mentioned in their Claim for Interlocutory Relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I have given the applicants leave to amend their originating application to delete paragraph 6, first appearing in the Details of Claim and paragraph 6 appearing in the Claim for Interlocutory Relief, and substituting there paragraph 6 in the following terms:
 
 '(6) An injunction restraining the respondent, his servant or agents from publishing, whether on the Internet or by any other means of communication to the public, any allegation to the effect that: 
 
 (a) the respondent or the respondent's former company, Chadmar Enterprises Proprietary Limited (in liquidation) is currently pursuing recovery proceedings against any of the applicants or their related entities; 
 
 (b) the applicants actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to destroy the respondent's business; 
 
 (c) the applicants actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to prejudice, damage, or destroy the business of independent retailers with whom they deal; 
 
 (d) the applicants have deliberately and improperly concealed the existence of substantial actions commenced by suppliers and customers, and thereby caused Metcash Limited to breach its disclosure requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">' 

2 Leave was also given to the applicants to amend the claim for interlocutory relief in the same terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The application for interlocutory relief first came before me on 24 February 2006 when the applicants sought ex parte orders in terms of paragraphs 1(b), 3, 4 and 5 of the Claim for Interlocutory Relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I made those orders on 24 February 2006 in the terms of an interim injunction which was to expire on 2 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On that day, the respondent consented to the orders continuing until 5 o'clock today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Whilst the respondent consented to the orders continuing, it was only for the reason that he wished to prepare his evidence to address the interlocutory relief sought by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was not, in any way, any admission by the respondent of the matters contained in the applicants' affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 On this application, the applicants have relied on four separate affidavits of Mr Peter Campbell (the applicants' solicitor), two affidavits of Mr John Hunter (the applicants' in-house general counsel) and an affidavit of Andrew Reitzer, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the holding company of the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 It is necessary to say something about the parties before addressing the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The first applicant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Metcash Limited, which is a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The second and third applicants are trading subsidiaries of the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The first applicant and the second applicant operate a grocery wholesale business throughout Australia, which business, Mr Hunter has deposed, generates an annual turnover of approximately $4 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The third applicant was formerly known as Consolidated Liquor Merchants Pty Ltd and carries on the business of a liquor merchant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 The respondent, Mr Bunn, has relied on an affidavit sworn by himself in answer to the applicants' claim for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Bunn was the proprietor of Chadmar Enterprises Pty Ltd ('Chadmar'), a retailer formerly supplied by IGA in the course of IGA's business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Chadmar is now in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 It is fair to say that Mr Bunn is aggrieved by the conduct of the applicants, both before and after Chadmar went into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is not necessary, on an interlocutory application of this kind, to enter into and inquire into the various matters which underlie Mr Bunn's grievances in relation to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It is simply enough to observe, and to put it in neutral terms, that Mr Bunn has carried out a spirited campaign directed to and against the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 The applicants claim that Mr Bunn has infringed the applicants' trademarks and continues to do so, that he has committed the tort of inducing parties with whom the applicants have contracted to breach their contracts, and that he has contravened ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (' Trade Practices Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">They claim, in respect of each of those causes of action on the facts contained in the affidavit to which I have referred, that there is a real likelihood that unless restrained Mr Bunn will continue to infringe the trademark, commit the tort, and contravene the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In respect of the first cause of action, they claim to be entitled to an injunction under the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (' Trade Marks Act ') or in accordance with the ordinary equitable principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In respect of the second cause of action, they seek relief in equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In respect of the third matter, they claim to be entitled to an injunction pursuant to the provisions of s 80 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 The first applicant is the registered proprietor of a trademark for the word 'Metcash'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">IGA Inc is the registered proprietor of the Australian trademark 'IGA'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The first applicant is licensed to use the 'IGA' name and mark in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The third applicant is registered as the proprietor of a trademark, 'ALM'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">10 The applicants complain that the respondent has and will continue to infringe their trademarks by operating two domain names on the Internet; namely, metcashinfo.net and IGA-ALM.net.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It is contended that the use of those names by the respondent on the Internet amounts to an infringement of the trademarks whereby they are entitled to injunctive relief, either under the terms of the Trade Marks Act or in equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The respondent has contended that there is no infringement of those trademarks because, in respect of each of those Internet addresses, the first page shows that the Internet address is not operated by the registered proprietors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Therefore, he says, there is no infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 The applicants complain that the respondent has committed the tort of inducing a breach of contract by advertising generally for parties who have contractual arrangements with the applicants to provide information relating to their contracts and commercial dealings with the applicants which, because of the standard form of contract between the applicants and their suppliers and retailers, would amount to a breach of those contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In respect of both their suppliers and their retailers, the applicants say that the parties are bound to keep confidential the terms of their contracts and their commercial dealings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Therefore, if they were to supply the information sought by the respondent they would be in breach of those contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They say that the respondent by advertising for those classes of people to contact the respondent for the purposes named in the advertisement that it amounts to a tort of inducing a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">12 The third cause of action, as I have said, relies upon the provisions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Of course, Mr Bunn is an individual and he will only have a liability under the Trade Practices Act if what he has done comes within s 6(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It is contended by the applicants that Mr Bunn's activities in relation to the two websites which I have identified amount to engaging in conduct which involves the use of postal and telephonic services so as to bring him within s 6(3) of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">13 The applicants also say that the impugned conduct amounts to conduct in trade or commerce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It was put that his conduct amounted to representations of a disgruntled trader in trade or commerce and, therefore, came within the terms of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">14 The applicants' claim, in relation to the respondent's conduct which they say amounts to a contravention of the Trade Practices Act , is that the respondent has made a series of allegations which are misleading and deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The categories of allegations of which the applicants complain have been severally identified in paragraph 8 of an affidavit of Mr Hunter sworn on 8 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He there identifies four different types of allegations; being recovery proceedings allegations, Chadmar destruction allegations, retailer destruction allegations, and concealment allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Hunter, in that affidavit, identifies the source of those allegations and in that same affidavit addresses the falsity of each of those allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">15 As I explained to Mr Bunn (who was unrepresented) during the hearing, the purpose of this hearing is not to determine any facts or to make any findings of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">What I am called upon to determine is whether the applicants have identified a serious question to be tried; whether the balance of convenience favours the applicants; whether damages are an adequate remedy; and whether the orders sought should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">16 I am satisfied on the evidence which has been produced that the serious questions to which the applicants advert have been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There are, in my opinion, serious questions to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I have no doubt that the balance of convenience favours the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">There would be no inconvenience to Mr Bunn in making the orders which are sought except the inconvenience of having to abide by those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">However, if the orders were not made there is a real risk that the applicants could suffer damage for which damages are not an adequate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">17 I am satisfied, therefore, that the applicants are entitled to the relief which they have sought except in respect of one aspect of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The applicants have sought six separate orders which, as I have said, are identified in the originating application as amended as mentioned above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that there is any need to make the order sought in paragraph 5 of the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I think if an order were made in the terms of paragraph 1 a., which I am prepared to make, there is no need for the further order in paragraph 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">18 I am not persuaded that there is any real likelihood that Mr Bunn would make any representation that he has a sponsorship or approval or affiliation of or with the applicants or any of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">For those reasons, I make the orders contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 in the minutes of order, except in respect of paragraph 6, I delete in the third line of that paragraph the words 'by any person' and include the words 'to the effect that'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Those orders are made, of course, on the basis of the undertaking as to damages which was filed by the applicants on 27 February 2006 and which Mr Wells QC has said today is still proffered in support of the application for the interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The parties will have liberty to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I reserve the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 
 I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
