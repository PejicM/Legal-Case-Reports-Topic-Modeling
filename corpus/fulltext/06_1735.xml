1 On 12 September 2006 Siopis J dismissed an application brought by Charles Zentai, who is the subject of extradition proceedings brought by the Republic of Hungary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The question of Mr Zentai's eligibility for extradition has been the subject of hearing before a magistrate who is a member of the Magistrates Court of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Mr Zentai contended that the learned magistrate was precluded from conducting the proceedings to determine eligibility under s 19 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act) on the basis that it was unlawful for the Commonwealth to legislate for State judicial officers to carry out the administrative functions prescribed in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He sought a declaration that ss 19 and 46 of the Act are invalid as going beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The application was dismissed by his Honour with costs on 12 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Subsequently, a notice of appeal was filed against his Honour's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The appeal has been set down for hearing in the February sittings of the Full Court in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Pending the determination of the application before Siopis J, the extradition eligibility hearing, which was listed before Magistrate Woods on 13 February 2006 was adjourned for mention on 17 March 2006, further adjourned to 20 June 2006, and then again to 22 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The hearing at that time was further adjourned to 11 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Chief Stipendiary Magistrate, who is named as second respondent in the appeal proceedings, has advised the parties that the matter would be set down for hearing on 11 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Mr Zentai applies for a stay pending the hearing and determination of the appeal in the following terms:
 
 'That the extradition proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia brought by the [Republic of Hungary] against [Mr Zentai] be stayed pending the determination by the Full Court of the Federal Court of the appeal filed by [Mr Zentai] against the finding by Siopis J that Magistrates sitting on the Magistrates Court of Western Australia may exercise functions under the Extradition Act 1988 ( Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">' 


Mr Zentai contends that his appeal will be rendered nugatory if an order is not made that the Magistrates Court, in effect, stay the extradition proceedings against him until the determination of the appeal to the Full Court, which is said to involve a constitutional question about the validity of s 19 in so far as it confers functions under Commonwealth law upon State magistrates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is also said, and there is no dispute, that the balance of convenience lies with Mr Zentai in applying for this stay, and that no prejudice flows to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Upon the return of the motion before me, counsel for the Republic of Hungary indicated that his client had not instructed him to oppose the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 The motion itself was filed in the appeal proceedings, and the question arises whether, if this were an exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court I, as a single judge, would have power to make an order of the kind contemplated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I think that is highly questionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">There is, nevertheless, authority for the proposition, including my own decision in Tuncak and Others v Young (1987) 14 ALD 286, and that of Hely J in NAMU of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 999 , and the earlier decision of Toohey J in Bercove v Hermes (No 2) (1983) 51 ALR 105 that is it open to a single judge, in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court and the application of the powers conferred upon judges of the Court under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to make an interlocutory order to ensure that an appeal to the Full Court, if successful, would not be nugatory, notwithstanding that the proceedings at first instance had been dismissed by the order of another judge of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Hely J in NAMU said (at [11]):
 
 'The weight of authority thus favours the proposition that a single judge may, in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court, and notwithstanding the dismissal of proceedings at first instance, grant an interlocutory injunction to operate pending a determination of an appeal to a Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In Bercove v Hermes Toohey J granted the interlocutory injunction even though the order dismissing the proceedings had been made by another judge of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Accordingly, I reject the Minister's submission that the present application is not one which may be entertained by a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Neither party asked me to refer the Motion to Beaumont J, and I conclude that I have the power to entertain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Motion was filed in the appeal proceedings, but that is an irregularity which is capable of being cured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 


In this case the order which is sought, as reflected in a minute of orders which has been submitted to the Court, would require the Chief Magistrate and the Magistrates Court to "be restrained from proceeding with any extradition process involving the applicant until further order".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Quite apart from the question of whether the Magistrates Court as an entity can be so restrained, having regard to the fact that the relevant function is conferred persona designata upon the individual Magistrate allocated to hear it and not in the exercise of a judicial function, there is the issue of comity and proper respect between courts which would make me very reluctant to make an order of the kind sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 It has long been the practice where a stay has been sought of proceedings in one court by a party involved in proceedings in another that the form of restraint is directed to the party prosecuting the proceedings in the other court, so that rather than an order purporting to apply directly to that court, which may of course raise questions not just of comity but of power, the order is directed to the party to restrain it from prosecuting the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The form of order that is appropriate in this case, and I am satisfied as a matter of discretion that it is appropriate to protect the utility of the pending appeal, is an order which would restrain the first respondent, that is the Republic of Hungary, from further prosecuting the eligibility proceedings under s 19 before any magistrate in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia pending the hearing and determination by the Full Court of the appeal or further order, and it is an order in those terms that I propose to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I will allow liberty to apply in case any difficulties should arise in relation to the implementation of my order s .</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
