1 This appeal concerns the construction of provisions of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ( the Regulations ), which were made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In particular, the meaning of r 5.19 is in issue in relation to the criteria for the grant of a subclass 856 visa under the Employer Nomination Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Regulation 5.19 deals with approval of nominated positions for the purposes of certain subclasses of visa, including subclass 856 visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The second appellant is the husband of the first appellant and the third and fourth appellants are children of the first appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The second, third and fourth appellants' applications are dependent upon the first appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Accordingly, I shall refer to the first appellant as the Visa Applicant .</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Item 1114A of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations deals with Employer Nomination (Residence) (Class BW) visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Subitem (4) specifies subclasses, which relevantly include subclass 856 (Employer Nomination Scheme) visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Clauses 856.21 and 856.22 in Schedule 2 to the Regulations specify the criteria that must be satisfied for the grant of a subclass 856 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Clause 856.21 specifies the criteria to be satisfied at the time of the application for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Clause 856.22 specifies the criteria that must be satisfied at the time of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 At the relevant time, clause 856.213 relevantly provided that one of the criteria that must be satisfied at the time of application was that the applicant had been nominated, in accordance with r 5.19(2), by an employer for an appointment in the business of that employer and that the applicant was a highly skilled person , within the meaning of r 5.19, in relation to that appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Under clause 856.214, if the appointment was an approved appointment at the time of application, a further requirement was that the period that had elapsed since the appointment became an approved appointment did not exceed six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Under clause 856.221, one of the criteria that must be satisfied at the time of the decision was that the appointment mentioned in clause 856.213 was an approved appointment .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 Regulation 5.19 deals with "Approval of Nominated Positions (Employer Nomination)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Regulation 5.19 provided that an employer could apply to the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ( the Minister ), for approval of a nominated position as an approved appointment .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Minister could approve or reject such an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">As soon as practicable after deciding an application, the Minister was required to give the employer a copy of the instrument approving or rejecting the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Regulation 4.02(4)(e) provided that a decision to reject an application for approval of a nominated position was an MRT-Reviewable Decision .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 5 of the Act provided for review of an MRT-Reviewable decision by the second respondent, the Migration Review Tribunal ( the Tribunal ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">5 Under r 5.19(2), an employer nomination met the requirements of that regulation if, relevantly:
 
&#8226; the employer nomination was made by an employer in respect of a need for a paid employee in a business located in Australia and operated by that employer; and
 
&#8226; the work to be performed required the appointment of a highly skilled person within the meaning of r 5.19(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 It is important to set out the terms of r 5.19(3) verbatim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That provision was in the following terms:
 (3) A person is a highly skilled person in relation to a nominated position if, in respect of work of the kind to be performed in that position: 
 
 
 (a) the person has completed, over a period of at least 3 years, formal training or equivalent experience; and
 (b) unless the approved appointment is exceptional, the person has been employed in work of the kind for which he or she was trained, or in which he or she is experienced, for at least 3 years: 
 
 
(i) after completing the training or experience referred to in paragraph (a); and 
 
 
 (ii) before making the application...
 
 
 

7 Revetec Limited ( the Employer ) applied to the Minister for approval of the position of sales and marketing manager with the Employer as an approved appointment pursuant to r 5.19(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Minister approved the application on 6 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">8 On 10 March 2005, the appellants applied to the Minister for a subclass 856 visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On 25 November 2005, a delegate of the Minister refused the grant of visas to the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The delegate concluded that the Visa Applicant failed to meet the definition of highly skilled person in r 5.19(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Therefore, she did not meet the requirement of clause 856.213.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As the Visa Applicant had not met the criteria for the grant of a visa, the other appellants also failed to meet the relevant criteria for the grant of visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 On 12 December 2005 the appellants applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">On 21 June 2007, the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant visas to the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On 17 July 2007, the appellants commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking Constitutional writ relief in respect of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">On 21 April 2008, after a hearing on 8 February 2008, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the proceeding be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The appellant filed a notice of appeal in this Court from those orders on 9 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">10 The grounds upon which Constitutional writ relief was claimed may be summarised as follows:
 
(1) The Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by wrongly directed itself as to the meaning of the term "equivalent experience" in r 5.19(3)(a), in so far as it took the view that, in order to show experience equivalent to three years of formal training as a sales and marketing manager, an applicant's experience needed to be five years at the fully trained level for a sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">(2) The Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to consider a request by the Visa Applicant that the approved appointment as sales and marketing manager with the Employer be treated as exceptional for the purposes of r 5.19(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The grounds of appeal to the Federal Court are, in essence, that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in rejecting those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
11 The Tribunal characterised the issue before it as whether the Visa Applicant is a highly skilled person within the meaning of r 5.19(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">That is to say, the Tribunal considered that the question before it was whether the Visa Applicant, at the time of her application, was a highly skilled person in relation to the approved appointment of sales and marketing manager in the business of the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">12 The Tribunal concluded that it had no evidence to demonstrate that the Visa Applicant had completed formal training over a period of at least three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Tribunal therefore considered that, for the Visa Applicant to be a highly skilled person, she must have completed experience equivalent to three years of formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">13 In that regard, the Tribunal had regard to the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations , which is published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( the ASCO Dictionary ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The ASCO Dictionary states that the entry requirement for a sales and marketing manager is a bachelor degree or higher qualification or at least five years' relevant experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It states that, in some instances, relevant experience is required in addition to the formal qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The ASCO Dictionary also sets out the tasks that would be performed by a sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">14 The Tribunal examined the evidence before it as to the qualifications and work experience of the Visa Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal concluded that, in the absence of formal training, the Visa Applicant was required to have completed experience equivalent to three years' formal training and observed that the ASCO Dictionary, as a guide, indicated that five years' relevant experience may be comparable to a bachelor degree or higher qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">15 In the light of that finding, the Tribunal found that a period of eight years' experience was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">This was based on five years' experience, being the equivalent of three years' formal training, as provided in r 5.19(3)(a), plus a period of three years' employment in work of the kind in which she is experienced, after completing that equivalent experience, as provided in r 5.19(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">16 Accordingly, the Tribunal examined the evidence of employment provided by the Visa Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It considered that, in some respects, the evidence was not credible and that the material provided, particularly in terms of dates relating to the Visa Applicant's employment history, was contradictory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal concluded that, on the evidence before it, it was not satisfied that the Visa Applicant had worked and gained experience as a sales and marketing manager for a period of at least eight years to the date of her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the Visa Applicant is a highly skilled person as defined in r 5.19(3) and therefore considered that she did not satisfy clause 856.213.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
17 I shall deal separately with the two grounds argued before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Regulation 5.19(3)(a) 
 
18 The Visa Applicant contended, first, in relation to r 5.19(3)(a) that the Tribunal erred in applying the provisions of the ASCO Dictionary that refer to a period of five years, in the face of what she said was a clear legislative expression requiring only three years' equivalent experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal, so the argument ran, misdirected itself as to the minimum period of work experience that the Visa Applicant needed to demonstrate as being equivalent to completing formal training over a period of at least three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">19 The primary judge rejected that submission on the basis that such a construction would leave no role for the legislative expression of the word "equivalent", in the phrase "equivalent experience".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Her Honour interpreted r 5.19(3)(a) to require the work experience to be equivalent to at least three years of formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">20 However, I am of the view that the phrase "over a period of at least 3 years" in r 5.19(3)(a) qualifies both of the expressions that follow, namely, "formal training" and "equivalent experience".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">That is to say, the requirement will be satisfied if a person has completed formal training over a period of at least three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The requirement will also be satisfied if the person has, over a period of at least three years, completed experience that is equivalent to formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It is, of course, a matter for the decision maker as to what kind of experience will be equivalent to formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In that regard, it would open to the decision maker to have regard to the ASCO Dictionary as a guide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">However, it is not necessary for a person to have completed the relevant experience over a period of more than three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">21 That follows from the syntax of r 5.19(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Further it does not deprive the word "equivalent" of a role; that expression serves the function of requiring the experience to be equivalent to formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">22 It follows that the Tribunal misdirected itself in so far as it construed r 5.19(3)(a) in a way that permitted the Tribunal to treat the requirement as being satisfied only if five years equivalent experience had been completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It also follows that the primary judge erred in failing to reach that conclusion in relation to the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">23 Secondly, in relation to r 5.19(3)(a), the Visa Applicant also contended before the primary judge that the Tribunal additionally misdirected itself by holding that, to meet the equivalent experience requirement, only employment experience at the level of a sales and marketing manager was comparable to undertaking tertiary study in that field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">That contention was directed to the Tribunal's finding that the Visa Applicant's work experience before October 2003 did not amount to experience at the level of a sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">24 The Visa Applicant argued that the Tribunal's approach implied that, from the first day of the relevant experience, the Visa Applicant should have had skills and abilities of a fully trained sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">She argued that it was erroneous to fail to consider whether her experience could have amounted to a graded development from unskilled to skilled, that would be equivalent to formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Visa Applicant said that the Tribunal erred in taking the view that any experience that was not at the level of a fully qualified sales and marketing manager was not comparable to undertaking formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">She contended that the Tribunal should have accepted any experience that could be interpreted as equivalent to formal training and not only experience at the level of a fully trained sales and marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">25 The primary judge did not consider that the Tribunal was required to assess a graded development from unskilled to skilled in determining equivalence to formal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">That is essentially a matter of fact for the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I do not consider that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question or took into account irrelevant considerations as contended by the Visa Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I do not consider that there was any error on the part of the primary judge in dealing with the second aspect of the Visa Applicant's contention in relation to r 5.19(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Regulation 5.19(3)(b) 
 
26 The second ground relates to r 5.19(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In essence, the Visa Applicant contended that the Tribunal failed to discharge its function of assessing and determining whether the approved appointment as marketing and sales manager in the employment of the Employer was exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">27 A requirement of clause 856.213 was that, at the time of the application by the Visa Applicant, the Visa Applicant had been nominated by the Employer in respect of an appointment in the business of the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It was not necessary that, at the time of the application, that appointment be an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">However, clause 856.214 required that, if the appointment was an approved appointment at the time of the application, no more than six months had elapsed since the granting of approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In the present case, the appointment as sales and marketing manager in the business of the Employer was not an approved appointment at the time of the Visa Applicant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">28 On the other hand, the requirement of clause 856.213 was that, at the time of the application, the Visa Applicant be a highly skilled person in relation to the appointment as sales and marketing manager in the business of the Employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">That is to say, it was necessary that the Visa Applicant was a highly skilled person within the meaning of r 5.19(3) as at the time of her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">29 Prima facie , in order to be a highly skilled person, the Visa Applicant must have been employed in work of the kind in which she was relevantly experienced for at least three years after completing that experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It is only if "the approved appointment is exceptional" that that prima facie requirement need not be satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">At the time of the application by the Visa Applicant, there was no approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Accordingly, it was not possible to conclude that the approved appointment was exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">30 It would have been open to the Visa Applicant to wait until the appointment as sales and marketing manager in the employ of the Employer had become an approved appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">However, in the present case, at the time of her application, it was not an approved appointment and, accordingly, the exception in r 5.19(3)(b) could not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">31 It is difficult to see the rationale for drawing such a distinction and there may be a degree of arbitrariness in such a construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That is to say, it is difficult to see why the exception in r 5.19(3)(b) should be limited to a case where there was an approved appointment prior to the making of an application for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">32 In any event, the question of whether an approved appointment is exceptional is not one for the decision maker in relation to the application for a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The scheme of the provisions indicates that decisions concerning the approval of an appointment, and whether an approved appointment is exceptional, are to be made independently of the decision on an application for a visa (see An v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 97 ; (2007) 160 FCR 480).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The application for approval of an appointment is made by an employer and there is a separate process and regime for dealing with such an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Thus, it was not part of the function of the Tribunal, in reviewing the application by the Visa Applicant, to consider whether or not the position of sales and marketing manager in the business of the Employer was exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The regime for that decision is independent of the granting of the relevant visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">33 Finally, even if it were within the function of the Tribunal to consider whether the approved appointment was exceptional, I do not consider that the Tribunal was fairly requested to consider that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Under cover of a letter dated 7 March 2005, the Visa Applicant's migration agent submitted various documents to the Department in relation to the Visa Applicant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Nothing in that material addressed the question of whether the proposed appointment as sales and marketing manager in the employ of the Employer should be treated as exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Minister's delegate requested further information from the migration agent and further information was furnished in November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Once again, no question of the proposed appointment's being treated as exceptional was raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">34 Following the delegate's decision, the Visa Applicant's migration agent submitted an application for review by the Tribunal under cover of a letter dated 12 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The question of the approved appointment's being treated as exceptional was not raised in that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">35 However, on 15 June 2006, the Tribunal wrote to the Visa Applicant's migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In that letter, the Tribunal drew attention to the provisions of r 5.19(3) and invited the Visa Applicant to provide additional information, including:
 An explanation with supporting evidence as to why the appointment should be considered exceptional should you wish to be exempt from the requirement of 3 years post training experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In a letter of 13 July 2006 in response to that specific invitation, the migration agent referred to the relevant paragraph of the ASCO Dictionary, which was ultimately relied on by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The migration agent's letter went on to say as follows:
 We submit that [the Visa Applicant] has at least 5 years [experience] (September 1997 to 2006) and therefore meets the minimum ASCO requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">If the Tribunal is of the opinion that [the Visa Applicant] does not meet the requirements, then [the Visa Applicant] requests that she should be exempted from the prescribed requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">There were sufficient documentations that were previously presented to support her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">36 Once again, although the response referred to exemption, there was no express request to treat the appointment as sales and marketing manager in the employ of the Employer as exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Further, the response contained no suggestion as to why the approved appointment should be considered exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The migration agent's response was not a request to the Tribunal to exercise any function of determining whether or not the approved appointment should be treated as exceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Thus, even if it were part of the Tribunal's function to determine that question, there was no effective request for it to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">In any event, there was no material before the Tribunal upon which it could possibly have made a determination that the approved appointment was exceptional for the purposes of r 5.19(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">37 The ground involving the operation of r 5.19(3)(b) has not been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There was no error on the part of the primary judge in relation to that ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">CONCLUSION 
 
38 The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in asking itself the wrong question in relation to r 5.19(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The primary judge erred in failing to reach that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The appeal should therefore be upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The orders made by the primary judge should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In lieu of those orders, there should be orders that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and that the Tribunal be ordered to complete its review of the delegate's decision according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Minister should pay the applicants' costs of the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Minister should pay the appellants' costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.</sentence>
