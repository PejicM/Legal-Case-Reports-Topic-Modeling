<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Upon ordering the winding up of Australvic Property Management Pty Ltd ('APM') on 5 October 2007, I ordered that each party, each supporting creditor, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') and Saxbys Lawyers ('Saxbys') file with the Court and serve on each other written submissions as to costs and that leave be granted to the liquidator (if so advised) to file with the Court and serve on each party, each supporting creditor, the ASIC and Saxbys, any written submissions as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 Pursuant to these orders I have received written submissions from the plaintiffs, T &amp; G Welding Pty Ltd ('T &amp; G Welding') (a supporting creditor), ASIC, and Saxbys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Plaintiffs 
 
3 The plaintiffs sought the following orders:
 
 &#8226; The plaintiffs' costs be taxed and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act ');
 &#8226; The plaintiffs' costs of the hearing before Registrar Mussett be taxed and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act ;
 &#8226; Mr Brian Leslie Fisher ('Mr Fisher') pay the costs thrown away by reason of the setting aside of the order made on 3 July 2007;
 &#8226; There be no order as to costs for the hearing on 6 July 2007; and
 &#8226; Mr Fisher pay the costs incurred in relation to the hearings after the conclusion of the hearing on 11 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">

4 It is appropriate that costs should follow the event, and I will order that the plaintiffs' costs of the proceeding (including the hearing before Registrar Mussett) be taxed and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">5 I will further order that the plaintiffs be entitled in respect of their costs to be paid out of the security provided pursuant to orders of the Court made on 29 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">6 In view of the history of the application made on 3 July 2007 and the events on 6 July 2007, I propose to make no specific orders as to costs in relation to the hearings on 3 July 2007 and 6 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Those costs will be part of the orders I already propose to make in relation to the proceeding generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I observed that reserve costs are dealt with in the Federal Court Rules (see O 62 r 15).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">7 The plaintiffs requested that Mr Fisher be ordered to pay the costs incurred in relation to the hearings after the conclusion of the hearing on 11 July 2007 (on the principles set out in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178) because:
 
 (1) a considerable portion of time was wasted on the application to remove Saxbys which application was without merit;
 (2) the application for leave to reopen APM's case was seeking an indulgence and was without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">

8 It was contended that Mr Fisher's conduct was unreasonable in the sense used by Goldberg J in White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169 in that:
 
 (1) the applications were hopeless; 
 (2) Mr Fisher conducted and managed the proceeding in disregard of any proper consideration of the prospects of success; and 
 (3) no practitioner who was reasonably well-informed and competent would have so acted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">

9 The application by APM to re-open was permitted on a limited basis, although the application by APM to remove Saxbys was unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">However, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate in the context of the applications made on behalf of APM or in the conduct of the proceedings generally, that I should make a cost order directly against Mr Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I do not consider that Mr Fisher's own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable, or even that if the application against Saxbys was obviously without merit, that a costs order against Mr Fisher would be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I appreciate that Mr Fisher (as the director of APM) was granted leave to appeal the decision of Registrar Musset, but the hearing was to be treated de novo to consider the solvency of APM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">10 Further, I am not satisfied that the interests of justice require an order to be made against Mr Fisher where costs can be accommodated in accordance with the statutory regime or as part of the costs in the winding up --- see generally Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 and Symphony Group Plc v Hodgson [1994] QB 179 at 191-192 per Balcombe LJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">11 I consider that the plaintiffs (and, for that matter, those supporting the plaintiffs' application), having brought their application on the basis of a failure to comply with a statutory demand, should be reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act (or as part of the costs in the winding up).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">12 I do, however, consider that there was a considerable loss of time, inconvenience to the parties and the Court, and a wilful disregard to established law in the attempts to re-open the case (other than on the limited basis permitted) and in the application for a restraining order against Saxbys --- see generally Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401; Ugly Tribe Company Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 ; Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager [1984] VR 483 at 502.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">13 Whilst I do not consider it appropriate to order Mr Fisher to pay these costs, the Court is warranted in making orders to prevent as far as possible the plaintiffs from being out of pocket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">I propose to order, therefore, that in relation to the hearings after the hearing of 11 July 2007, the plaintiffs' costs be taxed on an indemnity basis and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">T &amp; G Welding 
 
14 T &amp; G Welding sought orders that its costs of the proceeding (including the costs of the hearing on 12 June 2007) should be:
 
(a) costs in the winding up; and/or
 
(b) paid by Mr Fisher,
in each case on an indemnity basis, alternatively on a solicitor and own client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">15 For the reasons given above in relation to the submission of the plaintiffs that Mr Fisher should pay costs, I reject the similar contention put on behalf of T &amp; G Welding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">16 However, I accept that T &amp; G Welding, as a supporting creditor, should be entitled to its costs in the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">17 In addition to making submissions similar to the plaintiffs' about the events which occurred after the hearing on 11 July 2007, T &amp; G Welding also submitted that because of the conduct of APM during the proceedings generally (particularly its tardiness in filing material as ordered by the Court and its abandonment of certain evidence), the costs to be ordered in favour of T &amp; G Welding should be ordered on an indemnity or solicitor and own client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">18 I am prepared to do so in relation to the costs of and in connection with the hearings after the hearing on 11 July 2007 for the reasons given above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">However, I do not consider that it is appropriate to otherwise order indemnity costs or costs on a solicitor and own client basis, despite the series of events accurately described in the written submissions of T &amp; G Welding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">19 In view of the nature of APM, its business activities, its involvement in other litigation and the state of its financial records, I cannot be satisfied without more that APM had involved itself in this part of the proceedings in sufficiently unmeritorious, deliberately high-handed or otherwise improper conduct so to as warrant the order sought by T &amp; G Welding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">ASIC 
 
20 ASIC sought its costs of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">ASIC intervened in this proceeding pursuant to s 1330 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">A costs order could be granted in its favour should the Court so exercise its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">21 In normal circumstances ASIC, in protecting the public interest, may not obtain a costs order in its favour even if its contentions are accepted, or, for that matter, suffer an adverse costs order against it in the event that its contentions are not accepted by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">22 However, in this proceeding, ASIC appropriately played a significant part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">ASIC had a special interest in supporting the order sought in view of other proceedings before the Court, heard concurrently, where it also sought as final relief the winding up of APM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">23 I propose to order that ASIC's costs of the proceeding be costs in the winding up and be taxed on a party/party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">24 ASIC also seeks costs of its notice of motion dated 28 September 2007 notwithstanding that it was dismissed on 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">25 ASIC, through its notice of motion, was properly seeking to inform the Court of relevant matters which APM had failed to do in a timely and appropriate manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Whilst the motion was dismissed, the substantive matters raised by ASIC were accepted by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">By making the general order as to costs as proposed above in favour of ASIC, without excluding the notice of motion dated 28 September 2007, ASIC will be entitled to its costs of the proceedings generally (including the notice of motion dated 28 September 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Saxbys 
 
26 Saxbys submitted that its costs of:
 
 &#8226; the notice of motion filed by APM on 24 July 2007; and 
 &#8226; the notice of motion filed by Saxbys on 28 August 2007 (to set aside the subpoena served on it), 

should be:
 
 &#8226; costs in the winding up; and/or
 &#8226; paid by Mr Fisher, 

in each case on an indemnity basis, alternatively on a solicitor and own client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">27 For the reasons given above, I do not propose to make any orders against Mr Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">However Saxbys are entitled to costs in the winding up, and the question is whether the costs should be on an indemnity (or solicitor and own client basis) or on a party/party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">28 In my view, the application to restrain Saxbys was misconceived and obviously without merit, as was the subpoena to Saxbys seeking various documents in support of that application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Saxbys put APM on notice that such application and subpoena should be withdrawn to avoid adverse cost consequences for APM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">29 I do not accept on the current material that the application to restrain Saxbys was necessarily to intimidate or harass Saxbys or its clients, although I do accept that there was no basis to support the legitimacy of such motion to disqualify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The allegations made against Saxbys were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In my view they were clearly unmeritorious, and to the extent possible, Saxbys should not be out of pocket --- see generally Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401; Ugly Tribe Company Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 ; Australian Guarantee Corp Ltd v De Jager [1984] VR 483 at 502.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">30 I propose to order that Saxbys costs be costs in the winding up and be taxed on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Other Supporting Creditors 
 
31 In relation to the other supporting creditors, I propose that the order as to costs of those professionally represented be the same as those I propose to order in relation to T &amp; G Welding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">No submissions were received in respect of costs by those who were not professionally represented before me and I do not propose to make any order in relation to their possible disbursements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">CONCLUSION 
 
32 Accordingly, I propose to order that:
 
 &#8226; The plaintiffs' costs of the proceeding (including the hearing before Registrar Mussett) be taxed: 
 
 
 (a) on a party/party basis up to and including the hearing of 11 July 2007;
 (b) thereafter on an indemnity basis of and in connection with the hearings after 11 July 2007, 
 
 
 and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act ;
 &#8226; The plaintiffs be entitled in respect of their costs to be paid out of the security provided pursuant to orders made by the Court on 29 May 2007; 
 &#8226; ASIC's costs of the proceeding be costs in the winding up and taxed on a party/party basis; 
 &#8226; Saxbys' costs of the notice of motion filed by APM on 24 July 2007 and of the notice of motion filed by Saxbys on 28 August 2007 be costs in the winding up and taxed on an indemnity basis;
 &#8226; T &amp; G Welding's costs of the proceeding (including the hearing before Registrar Mussett) be costs in the winding up and taxed: 
 
 
 (a) on a party/party basis up to and including the hearing of 11 July 2007;
 (b) thereafter on an indemnity basis of and in connection with the hearings after 11 July 2007; 
 
 
 &#8226; R &amp; A Cab Co Pty Ltd's costs of the proceeding (including the hearing before Registrar Mussett) be costs in the winding up and taxed: 
 
 
 (a) on a party/party basis up to and including the hearing of 11 July 2007;
 (b) thereafter on an indemnity basis of and in connection with the hearings after 11 July 2007.</sentence>
