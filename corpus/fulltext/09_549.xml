 INTRODUCTION 
 The appellant is a citizen of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">She arrived in Australia on 7 October 2006 on a student visa to study English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 11 September 2007 she lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">That application was refused by a delegate of the first respondent on 5 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 9 October 2007 the appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is the manner in which the Tribunal hearing was conducted that now falls for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">A Federal Magistrate, on 19 June 2008, dismissed an application for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal ( SZLUD v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 799).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This is the judgment on appeal from that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">THE APPELLANT'S CLAIMS 
 The appellant claimed to fear persecution because she was a member of a group involved in an underground Christian Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">She claimed that as a child she attended meetings with the group with her parents about once a week and continued to attend as she got older.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In May 2001 the police found out about the group and raided her house during one of the meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant stated that her father and four others tried to escape but were caught and arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The appellant stated her father's leg was broken and he remained in hospital for about six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Following his stay in hospital he was detained by the police for a further two months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Subsequently, the police would come to her house to check on them from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Her church group nevertheless continued to meet secretly and she continued to attend the meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The appellant stated that her father and siblings left the local area in 2004 because of the danger of being detained again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">She claimed that she was unaware of where they were at the time of the hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Because she was under 18 years old, she said she did not face the same risk of arrest as others so she was able to remain with her paternal grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">She claimed that she continued to attend the group services on a regular basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Her grandmother could not go to the meetings because of her age although she was a committed Christian and knew a lot about the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appellant says that in 2006 her father arranged for her to travel to Australia to study because she was soon to turn 18 years and if she were to remain in China would be in greater danger of arrest because of her religion once she reached that age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The appellant stated that she did not apply for a protection visa prior to arriving in Villawood Detention Centre because, as an 18 year old person, she did not know that this was possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Further, she speaks very little English and did not have anyone to help or advise her on what to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 
 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It was satisfied that the appellant had 'embellished, if not entirely fabricated, material aspects of her claim to be a refugee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal referred to her 11 month delay in applying for a protection visa after arriving in Australia, stating that it would have expected her to have made more of an effort to seek to remain in Australia on a lawful basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The appellant's explanation regarding her age, lack of understanding of the English language and lack of access to persons who could assist her did not satisfy the Tribunal as being acceptable reasons to explain her delay in applying for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal also referred to her inadequate knowledge of Christianity, finding that her level of knowledge was not consistent with the activities that she claimed to have participated in and participation in regular religious study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This issue in particular now falls for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal dismissed her application on the basis of 'the cumulative consequences of a number of adverse credibility findings'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal also found that additional overseas material provided by the appellant did not overcome the concerns the Tribunal had regarding her credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 Before the Federal Magistrate the appellant was represented by Mr S Prince of counsel as she was in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr J Mitchell appeared on both hearings for the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Before her Honour the appellant contended: Contrary to s 420 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act), the Tribunal failed to conduct the hearing in accordance with the requirements of substantial justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The decision of the Tribunal made wrongful, illogical or unreasonable findings of fact which were contrary to the evidence provided and not based on logical grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal's decision was affected by the Member's illogical and irrational findings about the [appellant's] credibility which were not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The decision of the Tribunal was induced or affected by the bias of the presiding Tribunal Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The learned Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the serious claims made by the appellant found that listening to the hearing tapes actually 'made clear the fair and measured way in which the hearing was conducted'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Her Honour found that the Tribunal Member asked the appellant open ended questions about her claims and had regard to her responses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Her Honour found that, in the circumstances and for the reasons it gave, the Tribunal's adverse findings were open to it on the evidence and material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Her Honour held that to the extent the appellant contended that the Tribunal was in breach of s 420 of the Act, s 420 is expressed to be facultative and not restrictive and does not create rights or a ground of review additional to those given in s 476 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The learned Federal Magistrate found that Grounds 2 and 3 merely disagreed with the findings of fact made by the Tribunal, inviting a merits review which could not be undertaken by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Her Honour stated that the Tribunal's findings and conclusions, including its adverse credibility findings, were open to it on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Her Honour noted that illogical reasoning does not of itself constitute an error of law or a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In relation to the fourth ground, the learned Federal Magistrate found the particulars in support of this claim were no more than a disagreement with the findings and conclusions of the Tribunal, including its adverse credibility finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Her Honour found that, based on a fair reading of the Tribunal decision and her review of the hearing transcript and tapes, there was no evidence that the Tribunal approached its task with a mind not open to persuasion; nor that the Tribunal acted capriciously, arbitrarily or without proper credit findings and by whim or intuition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">As no jurisdictional error was established, the application was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 The notice of appeal raised the following grounds: Her Honour erred by failing to find that the Second Respondent failed to discharge its functions under the Act, namely s 420 , by failing to conduct the hearing in accordance with substantial justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Her Honour erred by failing to find that the decision of the Second Respondent made wrong, illogical or unreasonable findings of fact which were contrary to the evidence provided and not based on logical grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Her Honour erred by failing to find that the decision of the Second Respondent was affected by the presiding Member's illogical and irrational findings on credibility which were not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Her Honour erred in failing to find that the decision of the Second Respondent was induced or affected by the bias of the presiding Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Her Honour erred by applying Maddy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 233 ALR 503 in circumstances where the presiding Member's comments went beyond the scope of 'personal experiences'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
 The two sections of the Act that are primarily relevant in this appeal are s 420 and s 476.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Respectively they provide: 
 Section 420 

 
 Refugee Review Tribunal's way of operating 

 
 (1) The Tribunal, in carrying out its functions under this Act, is to pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">

 
 (2) The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision: 

 
(a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and 
 
(b) must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 Section 476 

 
 Jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court 

 
 (1) Subject to this section, the Federal Magistrates Court has the same original jurisdiction in relation to migration decisions as the High Court has under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

 
 (2) The Federal Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the following decisions: 

 
(a) a primary decision; 
 
(b) a privative clause decision, or purported privative clause decision, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review under section 500; 
 
(c) a privative clause decision, or purported privative clause decision, made personally by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B or 501C; 
 
(d) a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision mentioned in subsection 474(7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 (3) Nothing in this section affects any jurisdiction the Federal Magistrates Court may have in relation to non-privative clause decisions under section 8 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 or section 44AA of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 
 (4) In this section: 

 
 " primary decision " means a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision: 

 
(a) that is reviewable under Part 5 or 7 or section 500 (whether or not it has been reviewed); or 
 
(b) that would have been so reviewable if an application for such review had been made within a specified period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">ANALYSIS
 Before dealing with each of the grounds, some general submissions were raised orally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">To some extent these overlapped with the appellant's written submissions but I will deal with them first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The appellant raised two specific errors in the Tribunal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The passage of the decision in relation to the first suggested error needs to be reproduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It is as follows: 
 Secondly, in Australia the applicant did claim to have regularly read her 'Bible [as well as] attending Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' Attached to the migration agent's letter of 5 November 2007 was also a 'certificate' from a named pastor 'confirming the applicant has completed the "Reconnect Course", while she had been detained at Villawood Detention Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">At the Tribunal hearing, the applicant also claimed the bible readings in Australia (prior to her detention) were conducted with friends, for instance at the home in which she lived in Auburn (where she resided with 3 or 4 other people).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I understand that church services, as they exist in Australia, may not reflect church services in other countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Further, the dangers involved in the practice of some religions in some countries, may limit the opportunity to gain a detailed knowledge of a religion in-country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">However, as stated above, the present applicant did claim to have attended an underground church 'regularly' in China (in community with others), and to have studied her Bible regularly in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The issue therefore, includes assessing whether the knowledge level of the applicant is consistent with claimed relevant activities and opportunities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">

 
 That said, when asked what she discussed in her bible study classes, the applicant responded 'miracles', and that 'God Save people'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">When asked to tell the Tribunal her favourite bible story/s the applicant referred to 'Luke Ch.7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">"love God love people".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">' I then put to her I wished to assess whether she was a sincere Christian as she had claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I therefore asked her why she would be compelled to practice her religion in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In response, the applicant said 'Jesus is lord', 'God create the universe', 'before born already knew what would happen in the future', 'sacrifice only son'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">She also claimed she would be compelled to practice her religion because 'love from God'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 The correct citation (and the appellant did give the correct citation) was Luke Ch 10 verse 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It reads: 
 27 So he answered and said, "'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,' and 'your neighbour as yourself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">' " 
 The Tribunal cited the wrong chapter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">What is perhaps more important, in my view, and is a fair submission from the appellant is that a quick reading of the paragraph dealing with the questions about religion would give the impression that the answers given were jumbled and confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In fact, the appellant says, the answer as to the content of the passage from the bible was a perfectly accurate, if abbreviated, summary of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I think there is some force to this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The question is also whether the Tribunal's decision conveys that the appellant could not easily demonstrate familiarity with the Bible or religious concepts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Whether this is so requires a more detailed examination of the transcript on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I have set that out below: 
 MEMBER: Okay I understand what you have said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Is there anything in particular that you would like to tell me in support of your claim to be a refugee?</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">

 
 Something for instance that I have not already asked you about?</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">

 
 INTERPRETER: No 

 
 MEMBER: Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">You've said that you- just as a matter of interest you said that you regularly read your Bible, is that correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Sorry I withdraw that- you said that since arriving in Australia you have regularly read your Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes 

 
 MEMBER: Did you read it with other people or did you just read it when you were on your own at home?</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">

 
 INTERPRETER: Read with people who were living in the same home as me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">

 
 MEMBER: So what did you talk about... when you read the Bible?</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">What kinds of things did you discuss?</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">

 
 INTERPRETER: About- we talk about the miracles performed and that how god saved people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">

 
 MEMBER: Do you have any- is there anything in particular about- is there any subject in particular- sorry --- was there anything in particular that you talked about that you though was partic- that you thought was important and interesting to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">

 
 INTERPRETER: Luke, Chapter 10 verse 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">That you should love God.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">

 
 MEMBER: Is that all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">

 
 INTERPRETER: Love people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Love people around you like you love yourself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">

 
 MEMBER: Let me ask you another question which is a bit broader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">What do you know about Christianity?</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Tell me some of the things that you know about Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">

 
 INTERPRETER: Jesus- is the lord is the God and the God created everything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Created the universe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">

 
 MEMBER: Anything else?</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">

 
 INTERPRETER: Before he was born he already knew what will happen in the future to the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">

 
 MEMBER: [Can I get someone to come into room 13 because I think I have a problem with the tape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">] I have been told that we have a computer recording system backup- so I intend to continue speaking notwithstanding the tape recorder seems to be- not beeping but emitting a sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">So what other kinds of things do you know about Christianity?</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">**********End of Tape One********** 

 
 INTERPRETER: He sacrificed his only beloved son to save the world- to save people 

 
 MEMBER: Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Let me try another tag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">You're claiming that if you had to suppress your religious beliefs to avoid prosecution in China, that would be prosecution for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Please say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">**********Start of Tape Two********** 

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">

 
 MEMBER: If I think that the strength of your religious convictions was sufficiently strong- I may find that you may be persecuted in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Please say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">

 
 But based on what you have told me so far I may not think that you know much --- that you know enough about Christianity that I may be satisfied that you have any religious convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Please say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">

 
 So what is it about Christianity which you believe- which compels you to practice it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">

 
 INTERPRETER: Love from the God.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">

 
 MEMBER: Is that all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">

 
 MEMBER: Okay listen now I understand what you have said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">

 
 I really- I have not formulated any particular views on this matter- well certainly I have not finalised any views on this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">What I need to do is go and think about it and draft my findings for reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">

 
 Now I am prepared to --- what's today?</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">---today is Thurs- Friday, 26 th October, I am certainly prepared to give you to the close of business next Friday before I finalise any decision that I may write up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Please say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">

 
 Are you intending to speak to your migration agent or is your migration agent intending to meet up with you some time next week?</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 In my view, reasonable minds may differ on the issue of whether this passage does or does not display a knowledge of the Bible and Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">But there is nothing in the exchanges, taken alone or with the totality of the questioning which suggests bias, procedural unfairness or other jurisdictional error on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The second major factual error, according to appellant's counsel, related to the conclusion as to the alleged embellishment of the accounts concerning the confrontations with the police in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Counsel for the appellant, Mr Prince stressed that the two statutory declarations taken together with the questioning of the Tribunal should lead to the inference that there was no mistake, inconsistency or embellishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the questioning, in particular by the Tribunal, clearly showed embellishment in the sense that the Tribunal Member made it abundantly clear on three occasions to the appellant that he was questioning about the 2004 incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">There were only two incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Yet she 'feigned confusion' between the incidents when he pointed out to her the inconsistency in the answers given and said that she thought the Member was referring to an incident in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The relevant passages of the transcript, reasons and submissions respectively are as follows: Transcript Concerning 2001 and 2004 Incidents
 
 
 MEMBER: You refer to a 2001 incident and a 2004 incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

 
 In your evidence to the Department you said that your parents left your local area when you were 15 because they feared they may be caught practising their religion in an underground church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">

 
 Though you did not mention it to the Department, you mentioned in your statutory declaration to the tribunal that that 2004 departure by your parents-please say that 

 
 Was a consequence of him being interrogated by the authorities about his involvement in the church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes 

 
 MEMBER: Now you said that ---everybody except you left you home area in China in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

 
 You said that you were under 18 at that time so you did not face the same risks of arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">

 
 INTERPRETER: I would not be arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">

 
 MEMBER: I must put to you that on the basis of the country information that I have seen it appears that the Chinese authorities can act in a fairly brutal manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">

 
 I therefore may not accept that you would not be arrested if you were in fact engaged in an underground church as you claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">

 
 INTERPRETER: There is a law in China that they cannot arrest people under 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">

 
 MEMBER: Okay I understand what you have just said- I put to you again that it is commonly claimed and the country information I have seen appears to indicate that the Chinese authorities don't necessarily always obey the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">

 
 Is that all you have to say on this matter?</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">

 
 Yes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">No?</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">... 

 
 MEMBER: I can easily wait a week that's not a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">

 
 You know- I just- let me ask you about the 2004 incident when you say- when you now say your father was interrogated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">

 
 And that occurred at the time I understand when you were approximately 15 years of age, is that correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">

 
 Where (sic-were) you living at home when your father was interrogated?</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">

 
 MEMBER: Were you actually at the home when you father was interrogated?</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">

 
 INTERPRETER: After school yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">

 
 MEMBER: Sorry was that a yes or no- 

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">

 
 MEMBER: Okay- I understand what you have now said is that your father was interrogated- was it by the local police or the PSB?</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">

 
 INTERPRETER: Local Police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">

 
 MEMBER: Was it not the local police but the neighbourhood committee?</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Or members from- or people from the neighbourhood committee?</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">

 
 INTERPRETER: Local Police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">

 
 MEMBER: Okay so the local police came to your house sometime after you had returned from school and interrogated your father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Please say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">

 
 Were you- were you watching this take place?</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">

 
 Did you see the interrogation?</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">

 
 MEMBER: And what did they ask your father?</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">

 
 INTERPRETER: They told people not to move people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">People there were singing religious songs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">

 
 MEMBER: No, no, no, no, no- you said in 2001 your father- my apologies, my apologies- sorry withdraw that- there are 2 incidents that you have brought to my- there are 2 principle incidents that you have brought to the Tribunal's attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">

 
 One is in 2001 and one was in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">

 
 Okay?</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Now I'm talking about the second incident that was in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">

 
 Now you just said at the 2004 incident there were people singing religious songs at you home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Is that correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes and the policeman said that they had already given us many warnings --- policeman asked why we were still singing religious songs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">

 
 MEMBER: So were there more than just family members in the home during the- sorry I withdraw that- were there members of the underground church at your family home- during the 2004 incident?</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">

 
 INTERPRETER: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Church people there but not many.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">

 
 MEMBER: Now in the second incident- sorry- you've provided one statutory declaration to the Department and one statutory declaration to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">

 
 And in the statutory declaration to the Department you have actually mentioned the 2001 incident when you father was caught worshipping with other undergrounds church members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">

 
 You've never mentioned --- in your evidence to the Department you didn't mention that you father was again caught in 2004, practicing with other church members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">You just said that he feared that he might be and then left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">

 
 Sorry that is at folio 69 at of the Department file at paragraph 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In your subsequent statutory declaration to the Tribunal you have referred to the 2004 incident... but you never said that he was caught- that you father was caught at that time with other underground church members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">

 
 You've now said that in fact you father was caught in 2004 by local police whilst singing religious songs with other church members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">

 
 Is embellishment a word that you can effectively translate into Chinese?</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">If I was to say that would appear therefore that you were embellishing if not entirely fabricating aspects of your evidence- of you claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Is that something you would be able to translate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

 
 Okay then that's what I want to say?</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">It therefore may appear to me that you are embellishing if not entirely fabricating some parts of your claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">

 
 INTERPRETER: We talk about 2001- just now?</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">

 
 MEMBER: No No, I actually confirmed with you that 2004 I in fact confirmed it twice that we were talking about the same thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">

 
 Would you like to comment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I have said my view that you are embellishing if not fabricating your evidence about the 2004, the alleged 2004 incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">

 INTERPRETER: No 

 The Reasons
 In relation to the questions of the 2001 and 2004 incidents, the Tribunal's reasons and the submissions for the appellant respectively were as follows: 
 The 2001 and 2004 incidents: 

 
 The Tribunal's s424A letter to the applicant included a comment that there was little detail in her written claims to the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">She had mentioned an incident in 2001 (in the Attachment to the s424A letter I had incorrectly referred to her being 2 years old at that time --- the applicant was in fact approximately 12 years old).</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">She had also stated her family, fearing further persecution, has fled their home area in 2004, leaving the applicant with her grandmother (who apparently lived nearby).</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In her statutory declaration of 20 October 2007 to the Tribunal, the applicant claimed her father was 'interrogated' in 2004, and this was why he had fled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The applicant then explained her father had been arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The Tribunal twice confirmed this was in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The applicant then resiled from this claim and said her father was not arrested in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">She claimed to have been confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">

 
 Given the difficulty in eliciting her evidence, I was concerned there may have been problems with the interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">However, I was commonly able to obtain a response meaningful to the question I asked, particularly if I repeated and or rephrased my question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Except for her apparent evasiveness, there was no other reason I had to be concerned about the quality of the interpreter at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">However, given my other concerns, I do not accept the quality of the interpretation sufficiently explains the adverse credibility issues discussed herein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">I therefore am satisfied the applicant sought to embellish, if not entirely fabricate her relevant material claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">... 
 The Submissions
 The 2004 Incident
 
 
 Contrary to the Court below's finding at [60 xxii] at [86], the evidence the appellant gave at the hearing in relation to the 2001 police raid and the 2004 incident was consistent with her previous statements and significantly showed that the appellant did not say that her father was either arrested or detained in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It was therefore not open to the Member to make adverse findings regarding this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">

 
 At the hearing [AB 100-102] the Member put to the appellant that it appeared that she was embellishing her claims in relation to the 2001 police raid and 2004 because: 

 
(a) She did not mention in her declaration to the Department [AB153] as she did in her Declaration to the Tribunal [AB231] that her father had been interrogated in the 2004 incident; and
 
(b) She did not mention until the hearing that the 2004 interrogation took place in the presence of other church members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">
 The appellant sought in her declaration to the Tribunal and during the hearing to provide the Tribunal with further information and detail about the 2004 incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It is not the case that the appellant sought to introduce an entirely new claim at any stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Indeed it is the exact purpose of the hearing to offer the appellant the opportunity to explain and elaborate on claims which the Tribunal is unable to accept in their present form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">

 
 In Alphaone [Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576] the Full Court of the Federal Court said: 

 
Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 In light of the principle enounced in Abebe [ Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510], that it is not for the Tribunal to make out the appellant's case for her, it is entirely appropriate for the appellant to have sought to amplify her previous claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">

 
 Further, it is submitted and plainly illustrated on the evidence that the Member made an error as to fact in accusing the appellant of saying her father had been arrested or detained in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The transcript reveals that the appellant made the statement " [m]y father received a warning from the police and he was arrested in the name of disturbing the peace" however she neither attributes this to 2001 or 2004 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Member immediately sought clarification and the appellant confirmed that the she did not say now or previously, that her father had been detained or arrested in 2004 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">

 
 Contrary to that, the Tribunal subsequently made the following mistaken and illogical factual finding: 

 
In her statutory declaration of 20 October 2007 to the Tribunal, the appellant claimed her father was 'interrogated' in 2004, and this was why he had fled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The appellant then explained [at the hearing that] her father had been arrested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Tribunal twice confirmed this was in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The appellant then resiled from this claim and said her father was not arrested in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">She claimed to have been confused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 The Tribunal then made adverse credibility findings concerning the appellant and concluded "I am therefore satisfied that the [appellant] sought to embellish if not entirely fabricate her relevant material claims".</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 In my view, once again, reasonable minds may differ as to the issue of whether there was genuine or feigned confusion on the part of the appellant or the basis for concluding that the confusion was feigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">But again, the fact that a different conclusion may have been open falls a long way short of jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">In fairness to Mr Prince's arguments, he does not contend otherwise but says that taking the 'two errors' cumulatively with the other features of the hearing to which he adverts and which I consider below, he contends that there was bias, apprehended bias and no substantially just hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Transcript as a Whole
 Mr Prince stressed that the content of the questioning and answering in the Tribunal needs to be considered as a whole rather than to be dissected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The response to this from Mr Mitchell was that that was the way that the Federal Magistrate was invited to look at the transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Having done so both on a piece by piece basis and on viewing it as a whole, her Honour was very firmly of the view that it demonstrated that the questioning and answering was conducted very properly by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">I accept that the conduct of the hearing taken as a whole needs to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">I informed counsel that I would, as requested, listen to the audio of the hearing as time in open court did not realistically permit that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">I should stress that the exercise of listening to the audio was not in order to see if the Tribunal reached the correct answer on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Rather it was in order to consider the serious submissions advanced by the appellant as to actual jurisdictional bias and illogicality of decision-making.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Mr Prince for the appellant put the appellant's case on the premise that an examination of the Tribunal transcript revealed that the exchanges which occurred in the Tribunal hearing were very similar to those considered in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I will not repeat the entire transcript that appears in the Tribunal hearing presently under consideration as much of it is set out in detail in the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">But it is necessary to set out some of the questioning which the High Court examined in Ex parte H in order to test the submission for the appellant that these proceedings were conducted in a similar manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">That transcript in Ex parte H is set out in some detail in the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Again, without citing all of it, I will refer to limited passages considered by the High Court: 
 [14]
 ... 

"[The Tribunal]: Do you know what it looks like to me, Mr [H], at this stage?</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">[Male Prosecutor]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">[The Tribunal]: It looks like to me that you -- you applied to come to -- you sought to come to Australia for reasons of employment, that failed in April 1997 and this -- this ...
 
 
[Male Prosecutor]: No, it's not failing that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">[The Tribunal]: All the rest of this is just a fabrication to -- to fix that problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">[Male Prosecutor]: Which ones?</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Which ones?</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">[The Tribunal]: The whole story about the -- being ...
 
 
[Male Prosecutor]: No, no, you don't understand, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">[The Tribunal]: Well, that's how it looks to me".</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">
 [15]
 ... 

"Mr [H], it looks to me like this is -- this is an attempt to fix your problem of not getting a job with Qantas or Ansett?</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">"
 
 
The male prosecutor then explained that he had applied for employment with Qantas and Ansett after experiencing police harassment when questioned about the stolen Airlanka laptop computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">This exchange then followed:
 
 
"[The Tribunal]: Well, Mr [H], if they thought you'd stolen a laptop computer in September 1996 ...
 
 
[Male Prosecutor]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">[The Tribunal]: ... my strong suspicion is that you wouldn't be sitting here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">[Male Prosecutor]: No, they couldn't prove it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">My -- my company managers they didn't -- they didn't think that I -- I stole it -- I did it -- I did it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">It was used by four of us, actually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">So, they -- after the company security investigations we -- all we went to the police station but they didn't harass the other three, other three people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">[The Tribunal]: Well, Mr [H] ...
 
 
[Male Prosecutor]: You're thinking that I'm saying lies?</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Definitely thinking that I'm saying lies?</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">[The Tribunal]: Yes, I -- you're absolutely right, Mr [H], I do think that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Perhaps I'll hear from your wife but you're absolutely right; that's precisely what I'm thinking, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">[Male Prosecutor]: You think that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">[The Tribunal]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">[Male Prosecutor]: Do you believing that I'm lying?</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">[The Tribunal]: Yes, that's precisely what I think at the moment, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">[Male Prosecutor]: How can I make -- believe me?</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">[The Tribunal]: I don't know yet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Perhaps I'll hear from your wife and we'll see how it looks to me then".</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">
 [16]
 ... 

"[The Tribunal]: Well, as far as I can see at the moment all they -- all they had reason to suspect you for is for having a couple of Tamil people stay the night -- well, stay four nights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">[Male Prosecutor]: I had to make an entry, I went to the police station at the first incident when they told us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">When I go to the police station do you know what he said to me, the police officer?</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">[The Tribunal]: No, I don't, I wasn't there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">[Male Prosecutor]: He noted down the thing and he said ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: This is back in March 1996?</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">[Male Prosecutor]: Yes, somewhere after -- just a couple of ..."
 
 
Without allowing the male prosecutor to say anything further, the Tribunal then said:
 
 
"Yes, thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Mr [H], I'm going to ask you to wait outside now while I hear from your wife, if that's all right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">"
 
 
 [17]
 ... 

"[The Tribunal]: I think -- do you know what I think?</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">I think that -- that having been unsuccessful in coming to Australia for reasons of employment that you and your husband have decided, well, if we can't get in by getting a job with Ansett or Qantas we'll become refugees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">[Female Prosecutor]: Yes, to do what?</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">To do ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: Get to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">[Female Prosecutor]: No, I don't think so because my husband ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: I must say your evidence is not terribly convincing, Mrs [H], and at the moment all I can see is that the -- that the police know that your mother was Tamil -- is that what -- I don't see any basis for the police suspecting you of anything else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Indeed, if they did suspect you of anything else why wouldn't they have arrested you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">"
 
 ...
 [21] 

 
"I understand what you're saying, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">I don't find it the least bit convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">"
 
 
Shortly thereafter, the Tribunal questioned the male prosecutor about the letters he claimed to have received from the LTTE as follows:
 
 
"[The Tribunal]: Tell me, Mr [H], why would the Liberation Tigers of Tamil [Eelam] write to you and give you a letter telling you on what day two of their named comrades are going to be present at a certain location?</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">[Male Prosecutor]: I don't know, actually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">[The Tribunal]: Are they idiots?</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">[Male Prosecutor]: I'm not sure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">[The Tribunal]: Well, are they really because they're a longstanding successful terrorist organisation and you don't get to be a longstanding successful terrorist organisation by sending people letters telling them what time two of your activists are going to be present at a certain location, do you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">[Male Prosecutor]: I know that but ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: That's just laughable, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">[Male Prosecutor]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">[The Tribunal]: Absolutely laughable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">"
 
 
 [22]
 ... 

"[The Tribunal]: How many -- how common is it, Mr [H], for there to be inter-marriage between a Sinhalese and a Tamil?</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">[Male Prosecutor]: I don't understand you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">[The Tribunal]: How unusual is your situation; you are a Sinhalese man who has married a part Tamil -- it's not very unusual, is it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">[Male Prosecutor]: I did not quite get you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">[The Tribunal]: How unusual is your situation, Mr [H]?</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">[Male Prosecutor]: It's not that unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">[The Tribunal]: No, it isn't that unusual, is it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">[Male Prosecutor]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">No, it's not that unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">[The Tribunal]: Yet you're telling me it's because of your situation that you are suspected of -- despite the fact that you're a Sinhalese -- that you're suspected of assisting the LTTE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">[Male Prosecutor]: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">[The Tribunal]: It's nonsense, Mr [H], isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">[Male Prosecutor]: I know that they suspect me; that's -- due to petitions, I know that, because of jealousies and all that, so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">[The Tribunal]: I'm here to listen to you, Mr [H], but I'm telling you quite plainly, Mr [H], that I'm unconvinced by your evidence at this point in time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">"
 
 
 [23]
 ... 

"You see, there's no basis whatsoever from my point of view on which I could conclude that you will be suspected of being an LTTE supporter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">You're Sinhalese.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">There is no Sinhalese support for the LTTE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Your wife doesn't even speak Tamil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">"
 
 
 [24]
 ... 

"[Male Prosecutor]: If you don't believe us it's nothing else to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The only thing that ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: You're absolutely right, Mr [H], I don't believe you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">[Male Prosecutor]: The people around us they wanted to chase us away from that place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In [1996] they stoned us after a couple of months later -- after our marriage they stone us then that was ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: Because they somehow guessed that your wife is part Tamil?</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">[Male Prosecutor]: They know that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">[The Tribunal]: They can tell just by looking at her?</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">"
 
 
There then followed a discussion as to whether the female prosecutor was of Tamil appearance until the male prosecutor pointed out that her appearance was beside the point because people in Sri Lanka were inquisitive about people's background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The Tribunal responded:
 
 
"Even if they know she's part Tamil ... in your evidence your situation is not unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">That's certainly my understanding, that your situation is not particularly unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">There isn't any evidence that people in your particular circumstance face difficulties, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">"
 
 
 [25] 
 ... 

"[The Tribunal]: So you keep saying but you just don't seem to be able to say anything that's the least bit convincing, do you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">[Male Prosecutor]: Than by -- stoning us ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: Mr [H], at this point in time I don't accept that you had a single difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">[Male Prosecutor]: Well, I'm sorry, sir, I have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">[The Tribunal]: Because they don't fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">They don't fit with what we know about Sri Lanka, they don't fit with your circumstance and I've heard you giving the evidence and I find you to be a most unconvincing witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">[Male Prosecutor]: Well, [sir], I had to go through a lot ...
 
 
[The Tribunal]: Mr [H], about all I believe from you is your name and address .</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">"
 
 
 [26]
 ... 

"I've found your evidence to be most unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It's an improbable story and you've told it very badly".</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">There was a further short exchange in which the male prosecutor said that he and his wife were hoping to go and hide in India to escape from their problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The Tribunal asked if there was anything else which he wished to add, to which the male prosecutor replied:
 
 
"If you don't believe us, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">"
 
 
The hearing then concluded, the Tribunal's final remarks being:
 
 
"All I have is a power to make a decision on the facts that I think are true and I'm afraid to say, Mr [H], I don't think that you've told me the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">I think that you've fabricated the story and it's most unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">So that's the basis upon which I'm going to have to make a decision, Mr [H].</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Good luck.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">" (emphasis added)
 The High Court observed that it will often be necessary for inquisitorial proceedings to test evidence on a vigorous basis and to ensure that the person is confronted with matters which bear adversely on credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Nevertheless it went on to observe that the Tribunal had gone too far.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">The High Court said at [32]: 
 In the present case, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person, in our view, might well infer, from the constant interruptions of the male prosecutor's evidence and the constant challenges to his truthfulness and to the plausibility of his account of events, that there was nothing he could say or do to change the tribunal's preconceived view that he had fabricated his account of the events upon which he based his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">In other words, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might well apprehend bias by the tribunal against the male prosecutor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">And because the female prosecutor's application stood or fell with his, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might, in our view, form the same view in her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">
 Mr Prince submitted that the transcript of the hearing is littered with examples of the Tribunal Member engaging in misleading and confusing conduct: 
 Most notably is the Member's tendency to make long and complicated statements and questions and the concluding (sic) such rambles with the question "Do you understand?".</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">This invites a "yes or no" response to the final questions but fails to give the appellant the opportunity to respond to the many issues and questions raised throughout the monologue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">

Four examples are given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In her Honour's analysis of these submissions (at [52]-[56] of her Honour's reasons) the submissions were rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Perhaps the most important observation to be made is that even if there were minor interruptions or some questions perhaps lengthily and inelegantly phrased, the Tribunal Member did, nevertheless, through the course of the hearing on three separate occasions invite the appellant to add anything else which she may consider to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">The Audio
 I have considered the submissions, read the transcript, listened to the recording of the hearing and considered her Honour's assessment which was also broken into a detailed assessment, question by question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">I am unable to conclude that her Honour was incorrect in her assessment and description of the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">I accept the submission of counsel for the first respondent, Mr Mitchell, that the questioning and answering in these proceedings was completely different from the questioning and answering criticised by the High Court in Ex parte H .</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">On listening to the audio record of the Tribunal hearing, at the outset the appellant clearly sounded apprehensive (unsurprisingly).</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">She became more assertive particularly when pressed by the Member in later questioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">That said, the Member was in my assessment generally temperate and patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">He was detailed in his explanations to the appellant as to the processes, and in his questioning to the point that he would withdraw and clarify or recommence some questions to ensure clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">If the latter were a vice, many good counsel could be guilty of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">When that occurred there was no reason to think on any occasion, that anything but the final form of a question was put to the appellant by the interpreter although there were occasions when the Member paused and broke up his comments and questions slowly and carefully to enable translation of the content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">There was no indication of the process causing any difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">The interpreter raised no problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">There were some requirements to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">There was nothing oppressive about these requirements in the circumstances when this was done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">For example such a requirement was used when the Member was simply summarising an earlier answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">On the other hand occasionally in relation to the giving of some answers, there were considerable pauses while the appellant gave an answer slowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">She was not pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The appellant appeared to be able to explain herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">I am not saying that the Member demonstrated a willingness to assist the appellant with her claim --- rather he was testing the claims that she had made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">To the extent he expressed scepticism about any aspect it was not, in my view, taken individually or collectively, in a manner which evinced a determination only to prove the falsity of her claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Illogicality
 Mr Prince stressed that the approach of the Tribunal was illogical, on the one hand, recognising that the appellant was a child at all times prior to entry into Australia and before making her protection visa application but dismissing those issues because at the time of the hearing she was 18 years of age and of adequate maturity to prosecute her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">I accept, as one must, that the maturity to prosecute the case would not change over night with the appellant turning 18, but the important distinction on which the Tribunal focussed was that the appellant was at least an adolescent rather than a child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">The Tribunal did refer to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (the UNHCR Handbook) (not that it was obliged to do so) and cited from the Handbook (at [215]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">That passage reads: 
 Where a minor is no longer a child but an adolescent, it will be easier to determine refugee status as in the case of an adult, although this again will depend upon the actual degree of the adolescent's maturity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">It can be assumed that --- in the absence of indications to the contrary --- a person of 16 or over may be regarded as sufficiently mature to have a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">
 Further, the Tribunal went on to observe that while the appellant was: 
 now an adult, the Tribunal is mindful it is possible that allegedly important incidents to which she had referred in support of her Protection Visa application, occurred when she was a minor, and possibly at a time when she could have been shielded by relatives and or friends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The Tribunal is thus satisfied the applicant presents as a person with adequate "maturity" to prosecute her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Further, the applicant provided no evidence that might have led the Tribunal to consider whether her experiences in China (or Australia) could have traumatised the applicant such that she was not able to prosecute her case before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">
 It is clear, in my view, that the Tribunal gave appropriate and careful consideration to the fact that the appellant had only just turned 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">I do not consider that there is illogicality in the approach which was taken by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Rather the Tribunal was taking a measured approach in balancing the fact that while the appellant was an adult, she had only just reached majority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">I turn now to consider the specific grounds of appeal with particular emphasis on the legal principles they raise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Ground 1
 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant submitted that contrary to s 420 of the Act, the Tribunal failed to conduct the hearing in accordance with the requirements of substantial justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The appellant contended that the Tribunal had failed to enquire orally about the police raid in 2001 (that being the origin of the appellant's fear of persecution due to her religious convictions), and had engaged in misleading and unfair conduct in the way in which it conducted its hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Her Honour noted that s 420 of the Act is expressed to be facultative, and not restrictive, and does not create rights or a ground of review additional to those given in s 476 ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 628; Sun v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 324 ; (1997) 81 FCR 71).</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">In Eshetu at [48]-[50], Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said: 
 [48] It is not an acceptable approach to statutory interpretation to negate the clear intention of the legislature by reliance on s 420 of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In any event, s 420 , when understood in its legal and statutory context, is an inadequate foundation for an attempt to overcome the provisions of s 476(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">

 
 [49] The relationship, or lack of it, between ss 420 and 476 was correctly explained by Lindgren J at first instance in Sun Zhan Qui v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs .</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The history of legislative provisions similar to s 420 was examined in Qantas Airways Ltd v Gubbins .</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">They are intended to be facultative, not restrictive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Their purpose is to free tribunals, at least to some degree, from constraints otherwise applicable to courts of law, and regarded as inappropriate to tribunals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">The extent to which they free tribunals from obligations applicable to the courts of law may give rise to dispute in particular cases, but that is another question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">

 
 [50] Section 420 is to be understood in its statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It appears in Pt 7 , Div 3 of the Migration Act , which is headed "Exercise of Refugee Review Tribunal's powers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The following two sections deal with the constitution of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Part 7 Div 4 deals with the procedures to be adopted by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Part 7 , Div 5 deals with similar matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">There follows Pt 8 of the Act, which includes s 476 , and which provides a set of provisions which confer, and define, the Federal Court's jurisdiction to review Tribunal decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">(footnotes omitted) 
 Her Honour found [at 63] that the Tribunal was not obliged to ask the appellant about the police raid in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">It was obliged to ensure that the appellant had an opportunity to say whatever she wished in support of her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Her Honour concluded that a fair reading of the transcript of the hearing and listening to the tapes, made clear that the appellant was invited on three occasions to say whatever she wished in support of her claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">However, it was not for the Tribunal to make the appellant's case out for her ( Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576; SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 225 at 14-16).</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">The appellant further contended that the Tribunal engaged in misleading and unfair conduct by asking long and convoluted questions, and asking questions and making comments then withdrawing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Her Honour observed (at [65]-[66]) that whilst a particular question by the Tribunal was long, it was interpreted every few words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The appellant's answer was ultimately responsive and did not suggest any lack of understanding by the appellant about what she was being asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The appellant further alleged that the Tribunal unfairly required the appellant to only answer certain questions in a 'yes/no' format, interrupted her when she was responding, and failed to give her an opportunity to state her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Her Honour found that the Tribunal was entitled to ask questions inviting a yes/no response and to direct the appellant's answers to its concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The Tribunal put its concerns clearly to the appellant and provided her an opportunity to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">It also put to the appellant open ended questions that gave the appellant an opportunity to say anything further she wished in support of her claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">The appellant was invited to elaborate on her claims at the hearing and was asked direct questions about her beliefs and practices relevant to her claims to being a Christian and her claims relating to the persecution of members of her church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">The fact that she did so in only the briefest of terms does not show that the Tribunal erred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The Tribunal was not obliged to prompt or stimulate responses from the appellant and had no general duty to inquire further: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1909 at [54] and [85][-86]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [1], [42] and [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">It was for the appellant to make out her case: Abebe 197 CLR 510 at [187].</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">It was also submitted by the appellant that the Tribunal failed to give appropriate weight to the consideration that the appellant was a minor at all times in China and at all material times in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Further, it was submitted that the Tribunal failed to consider the relevant provisions of the UNHCR Handbook and failed to give proper consideration and weight to the further evidence and submissions provided to the Tribunal on 5 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Her Honour found that the Tribunal made clear that it considered the appellant's age both at the time of the alleged incidents in China and at the time she was giving evidence in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The Tribunal found that the appellant had sufficient maturity to prosecute her case - a finding which was open to the Tribunal on the evidence and material before it and for the reasons it gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Her Honour also found that the UNHCR Handbook had no binding force on the Tribunal and it was not obliged to consider it or make findings in respect of it ( Semunigus v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 422 at 8-9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Nevertheless, her Honour also found that a fair reading of the Tribunal decision did not support the contention that the Tribunal failed to consider the materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The appellant had further contended that the Tribunal Member interrupted the appellant, 'was shutting down the hearing indicating that it had made up its mind' and that it only made enquiries into facts that might discredit the appellant and not those which may support the appellant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Her Honour found that the tapes of the hearing did not indicate that the Tribunal Member was aggressive, hostile or overbearing in the manner in which he asked questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The Tribunal Member asked his questions slowly and carefully ensuring his sentences were interpreted every few words, and provided the appellant reasonable opportunities to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal Member failed to give proper consideration to the significance of the 2001 incident in establishing the appellant's well-founded fear of persecution; and failed to give proper consideration to the significance of the 2004 incident in establishing the appellant's well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Her Honour found the Tribunal put to the appellant its concerns about the inconsistencies in her evidence surrounding these events, and that the adverse findings made by the Tribunal were open to it on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">In the appeal before this Court, the appellant has made essentially the same submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">I can discern no error in the approach of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Ground 2
 The second ground raised by the appellant was that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal made wrong, illogical or unreasonable findings of fact which were contrary to the evidence provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">The Federal Magistrate found that the particulars listed by the appellant were no more than a disagreement with the findings of fact made by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Her Honour also noted that, in any event, illogical reasoning does not of itself constitute an error of law or a jurisdictional error ( NACB v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 235 at 29).</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Insofar as reliance is placed on illogical or unreasonable findings of fact (in grounds 2 and 3), the appellant relies on the following submissions: 
 Section 75 (v) of the Constitution imposes upon the Tribunal an irreducible requirement that the review procedure is carried out according to law: see Abebe v Commonwealth (1999) 197 CLR 510 per Gummow, Hayne JJ at [170].</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">For the Tribunal to act in accordance with the law, its decision-making process must operate reasonably and rationally and not arbitrarily: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 per Deane J at 366-367.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">

 
 The Tribunal only has the jurisdiction to make a determination under the Act where the determination is based on findings or inferences of fact that are grounded upon probative material and logical grounds: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 per Gummow J at [145]; Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">The purported decision of the Tribunal has no "jurisdictional" foundation as its determination was based on the errors of fact described below: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Appellant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 per Gleeson CJ at [5]-[9]; McHugh, Gummow JJ at [34], [37]; Kirby J at [116], [127]-[128].</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">
 The Tribunal's findings of fact were open on the material and not vitiated by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Specifically: 
(a) The Tribunal's observation that the appellant claimed that her father had been arrested in 2004 and had then resiled from that claim was open on the evidence before the Tribunal;
 
(b) The Tribunal's findings as to the appellant's religious convictions were open on the evidence before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">These findings were not perverse, in the sense of being contrary to the overwhelming weight of the material before the Tribunal: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 368; see also NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 at [115] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 (at [129]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">There was little before the Tribunal, other than the appellant's assertions, that demonstrated she had been a member of an underground church in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">She had only joined a church in Australia nine months after her arrival in Australia and it was open to conclude that she showed only a vague and superficial understanding of Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The fact that the Tribunal focussed on the appellant's lack of knowledge does not indicate perversity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">It merely indicates that this aspect of the appellant's testimony weighed heavily on the Tribunal Member's consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Even if the Tribunal's appraisals of the appellant's testimony were incorrect or alternative inferences were open (which I have accepted), that does not ground jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Error of fact is a matter within the Tribunal's jurisdiction and does not demonstrate jurisdictional error: see Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; 197 CLR 611 at [40] , [45], [134], [137], [138], [145] and [147]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [92] ; Ex parte S20/2002 77 ALJR 1165 at [9], [36], [57] and [59].</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">In my opinion, the approach of the learned Federal Magistrate was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">I have dealt with the general submission but on the two errors supposedly made, these would not suffice to constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">It is clear that even if the reasoning whereby the Court reached its conclusion of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law: SZJEZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1741.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">In SZJEZ , his Honour referred to the decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141 where the Full Court stated: 
 A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example, by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">
 This ground has not been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">
 Ground 3 
 The third ground alleges that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the decision of the Tribunal was 'affected by the presiding Member's illogical and irrational findings on credibility which were not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">As observed by O'Loughlin J in Bains v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 403 at [17] : 
 it remains a fact that decisions of a court or a Tribunal about matters of credibility "are often based upon matters of impression, and an unfavourable view taken upon an otherwise minor issue may be decisive": Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex Parte Mansour Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 176 ALR 219 at 221 per Gleeson CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">If a Tribunal has reasonably come to the conclusion that it is unable to accept an applicant's evidence and its reasoning process cannot be faulted, there is no room for this Court to intervene even though it considers that it might have come to a contrary conclusion if it had been the original decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">
 In assessing the appellant's credibility, the Tribunal Member considered a number of factors including the appellant's delay in making the application, the plausibility of her evidence, her apparent lack of knowledge in relation to her alleged religious convictions and as the Member concluded, fabrication concerning the 2001 and 2004 incidents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Ultimately, the Tribunal Member concluded that the appellant had 'embellished, if not entirely fabricated, material aspects of her claim to be a refugee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">In my view, this finding was open on the evidence before the Tribunal and no irrationality can be discerned in the Tribunal's reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The Tribunal's appraisals of the appellant's testimony were open and based on a rational appraisal of her testimony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">She claimed to have been committed to her faith from the age of 15, having been raised in a Christian family at least from the age of 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">At age 18 she attended the Tribunal hearing but was unable to articulate her beliefs in anything more than generalities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The Tribunal's appraisals were not illogical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Even if those appraisals were illogical, that of itself is not capable of constituting jurisdictional error: NACB [2003] FCAFC 235 at [29] ; NATC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">In relation to the 2001 and 2004 incidents it is conceivable that another reasonable mind may have concluded that the responses did not support evasion or fabrication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">But equally, the findings reached by the Tribunal were open.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">It was not perverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">A finding may be irrational where the factual finding simply could not have been reached by any rational reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The ground of irrationality or illogicality requires a complete absence of a logical nexus between the evidence before the decision-maker, and the findings made, or inferences of fact drawn, by the decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">It is similar to the concept of 'Wednesbury unreasonableness' as considered in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 230.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">In SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; 207 ALR 12 , Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [38]: 
 the critical question is whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">If the decision did display these defects, it will be no answer that the determination was reached in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">
 The standard of unreasonableness connoted by the expression 'illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds' is a demanding one with a high threshold, just as it is relatively undemanding for the decision-maker; Greyhound Racing Authority (NSW) v Bragg [2003] NSWCA 388 per Santow JA at [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Ground 4
 The fourth ground alleges that the decision of the Tribunal was affected by bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The Federal Magistrate found that a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision, in the context of having listened to tapes of the hearing and having read the transcript, did not suggest the Tribunal approached its task with a mind not open to persuasion; nor that the Tribunal acted capriciously, arbitrarily or without proper credit findings and by whim or intuition ( NADH [2004] FCAFC 328 ; 214 ALR 264).</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">In the present appeal, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal Member had a pre-determined view about the appellant and certain issues relevant to her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">The appellant pointed to parts of the transcript which it is submitted indicates that the Tribunal Member 'regardless of any explanation or argument given by the appellant...immediately and entirely rejects such explanations and maintains his pre-formed judgment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">The appellant alleges that the Tribunal Member had pre-formed his judgment on the following issues: 
(a) the appellant's reason for applying for a protection visa;
 
(b) the reason for the appellant's delay in applying for a protection visa once having arrived in Australia;
 
(c) the behaviour of Chinese persons living in the Australian community;
 
(d) the behaviour of Chinese persons who seek the protection of Australia as refugees;
 
(e) the behaviour of Chinese authorities;
 
(f) the appellant's truthfulness;
 
(g) the quality and quantity of the appellant's religious convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">In my view, the Tribunal Member has simply put to the appellant his reservations concerning aspects of her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">For example, at page 14 of the transcript, the Tribunal Member states 'I may then have difficulty accepting that you are sincerely religious in your beliefs as you claim otherwise I may have thought you may have sought to attend a church in Australia sooner than you did'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Further, he says at page 20, 'I may not think that you know much --- that you know enough about Christianity that I may be satisfied that you have any religious convictions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZXPA [2008] FCA 185 Sundberg J commented on the function of the Tribunal in conducting a review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">His Honour stated at [14]-[15]: 
 An informed and instructed hypothetical person would also know that the Tribunal is an inquisitorial body, and is not required uncritically to accept an applicant's claims: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">It is required under the Act, in performing its review function, to consider whether or not it is satisfied that an applicant meets the criteria for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">If not so satisfied, it must refuse to grant the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 at [16] ---[18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">The Tribunal is accordingly required to assess the probative value of evidence put before it by an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Where the Tribunal perceives weaknesses in that evidence, it is entitled vigorously to test that evidence: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">

 
 Accordingly, under the Act, the expression of a preliminary view, even on a critical matter, does not establish bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">(emphasis added) 
 There is nothing in the decision record that suggests that the Tribunal Member had a pre-existing state of mind which disabled him from undertaking or rendered him unwilling to undertake any proper evaluation of the relevant materials before him ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [35] and [72]) or that a fair-minded lay observer, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct of the Tribunal, might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal Member may not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided: Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; 179 ALR 425 at [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Indeed, on listening to the audio, I would conclude the opposite was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The transcript does not show that the appellant was overborne in the manner identified in Ex parte H at [13]-[25] or that the Tribunal Member was openly hostile to the appellant in the manner identified in NADH [2004] FCAFC 328 ; 214 ALR 264 at [63] - [99] and [118].</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">In relation to allegations of bias, it is well established that such allegations must be distinctly made and clearly proved: Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; 205 CLR 507.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">That the Tribunal confronted the appellant with matters that brought her account into question is not indicative of bias: Ex parte H at [27] and [30].</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Neither do the adverse credibility findings made by the Tribunal indicate, of themselves, that the Tribunal was not open to persuasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">It was open to the Tribunal to form a view, based on a consideration of her testimony and her demeanour, that she was not credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">That does not indicate bias: Ex parte H at [34].</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Further, apprehended bias must be firmly established and is not found on any sense of unease about the Tribunal's findings: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at [90] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">In my view, no actual or apprehended bias can be discerned on the part of the Tribunal Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Ground 5
 Finally, the appellant claims that her Honour erred by applying Maddy v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 233 ALR 503 in circumstances where the Presiding Member's comments went beyond the scope of 'personal experiences'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The Tribunal had put to the appellant that it did not believe that she would not have asked members of her church congregation for assistance if she really was a refugee, then corrected, its language to say that it may have difficulty in believing that she did not ask.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">The Tribunal explained that the reason was because: 
 Refugee issues in Australia are extremely high profile and it's the kind of thing --- in my experience --- commonly the case that church groups get involved in assisting people who claim to be refugees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">And particularly if you came from a church organisation where there were members of a community who --- who regularly claim refugee protection in this country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">
 Her Honour accepted the submission of the respondent that the Tribunal was entitled to rely on its own knowledge or personal experience to inform its view of relevant issues and to put such matters to the appellant at the hearing (as per Maddy and NAEH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 927 per Branson J at 13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">No error can be found in the approach taken by Her Honour in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Her Honour did not err in her consideration of Maddy .</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">The Tribunal Member clearly called upon his own previous experience of applications that had come before the Tribunal when it asked some of the questions it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">This was what occurred in Maddy : see at [75] and [80].</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It was open for the Tribunal Member to do so and provided the appellant with an opportunity to address the matters raised by the Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">There was no error in the Tribunal so doing and there was no error in the Court below making findings that the Member's conduct was unexceptional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">In my opinion, none of the grounds is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Her Honour's conclusion was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">
 CONCLUSION 
 I will order: The appeal will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">The appellant is to pay the costs of the first respondent to be taxed if not agreed.</sentence>
