<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett in which his Honour dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of the Republic of Korea, also known as South Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">She claimed that she feared persecution if returned to South Korea in the reasonably foreseeable future on account of her political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She claimed that she joined a newly formed trade union in May 1998 and was involved in demonstrations and protests in public areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Those events received widespread media coverage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">She and her boyfriend were beaten by police after a protest organised by the union in January 2000 in front of the Seoul City Council building.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">She was detained after the protest for six days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">She claimed compensation from the government, without success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She said her actions in seeking justice led to adverse attention from criminal gangs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">She further claimed as follows:
 
&#8226; after a death threat received in April 2002 she fled Seoul and went to live in Wonji City where her relatives found her a job;
 
&#8226; after two years had elapsed she returned to Seoul to care for her sick mother; 
 
&#8226; in December 2004, she was assaulted by masked men and returned to Wonji City, where she continued to receive death threats;
 
&#8226; in July 2005, she decided to leave South Korea as she considered her safety was threatened because she was a union member who supported strikes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 After considering "independent country information", the delegate found the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to South Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant sought a merits review of that decision before the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal observed that it invited the appellant to give oral evidence before it at a hearing scheduled for 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Tribunal noted it advised the appellant that if she did not attend the hearing and a postponement was not granted, the Tribunal would make a decision on her review application without further notice to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 The Tribunal received no response to its invitation to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant did not appear on 13 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The next day the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa and handed down that decision on 5 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">That course was available to the Tribunal under s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">6 The Tribunal accepted the appellant is a citizen of South Korea and is who she claims to be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It was not satisfied, on the material before it, of the essential claims made by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It was not satisfied that she is or was a union member in South Korea or that she was persecuted or feared persecution there because of her union activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It considered her claims to be no more than "untested assertions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision before the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She raised two issues: first, she contended the Tribunal breached s 424A of the Act and, second, the Tribunal failed to exercise its discretion under s 426A to hold a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 The appellant claimed the Tribunal did not give her particulars of information which it considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">She claimed that the Tribunal had thereby breached s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">9 Her counsel developed that argument by reference to the Tribunal's letter which invited the appellant to a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That letter included the observation that the Tribunal had considered the material before it, but was unable to make a decision on that information alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">There was no new information before the Tribunal, only the information that was before the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appellant submitted because she did not attend the hearing, the Tribunal had to give particulars of the information it relied on to reject her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This argument falls at its first hurdle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal did not reject the application on the basis of any information but rather on account of a lack of, or insufficiency of, information such that the claims of the appellant were characterised as "untested assertions"; see SZING v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1421 at [4] to [5] and the authorities referred to in that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 The appellant's submission based on s 426A is also without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal had nothing before it on which it could exercise its discretion to defer making a decision on the application in circumstances where the appellant had not responded to an invitation to attend a hearing and failed to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">11 The appeal is dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Associate:

Dated: 24 November 2006
