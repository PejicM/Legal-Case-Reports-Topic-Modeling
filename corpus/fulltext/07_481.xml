<sentence id="s0">
 
1 In these proceedings the applicants allege that the respondents have infringed Australian Patent No 656757 which is entitled 'Collapsible Canopy Framework having Captured Scissor Ends with Non-Compressive Pivots' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its priority date is 4 January 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The alleged infringements involve two versions of a product called 'Caravan Instant Shelter' which the respondents imported into and sold in Australia at various times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The third applicant, KD Kanopy Inc, is a company incorporated in the United States of America and the assignee of the patent pursuant to an Assignment Agreement with the personal representative of the inventor, James Lynch (deceased), dated 19 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It is the registered proprietor of the Australian patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The second applicant, Mr Dand, is a director of the first applicant (KD Kanopy Australasia) and he and that company claim to have been the exclusive licensees of the patent in Australia at all relevant times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 From about September 2000 one or more the respondents imported and sold a product called 'Caravan Instant Shelter' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">A later version of this product was imported and sold from about May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The respondents admit that the earlier version of the product has all of the essential features of, and may infringe, the claims of the patent in suit, but deny that the later version has those features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">They contend that, to the extent that there has been infringement, there can be no liability to the first, second and fourth applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They deny that they are the exclusive licensees and able to maintain a claim for infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The focus of this aspect of their defence is upon a Distribution Agreement entered into between the first, second and third applicants on 24 December 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 The respondents also attack the validity of the patent in question on the grounds that it was not novel; that it lacks any inventive step and the claims in question are not fairly based and lack clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They cross-claim for an order revoking the claims the subject of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">THE COMPLETE PATENT SPECIFICATION 
 
5 The collapsible canopy the subject of the patent is portable in its folded state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Scissor assemblies allow it to expand into a canopy which provides shade or shelter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The author of the patent points out that structures such as this have been used for a very long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The scissor assemblies are fastened to upright support members by mounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The patent is concerned with these mounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It is explained in the specification that: 
 
 'The present invention generally relates to improvements in collapsible shelters such as shelters described in my earlier disclosed scissor canopy structures referenced above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Specifically, the present invention relates to a structural device, in the form of a non-compressible mount having sockets, which capture end portions of scissor assemblies so as to connect scissor assemblies to each other and to other structural components of a canopy structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The mounts are structured to provide free pivots while at the same time resisting lateral and torsional deflections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Accordingly, the present invention generally relates to the attachment of pivoting structural members in an integrated canopy system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 

6 The inventor advises that the patent is related to the structure of the inventions disclosed in three U.S. patents granted to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">US Patent No 4 641 676 is said to disclose a portable canopy structure which has a framework that may be collapsed into a stored state and yet may be expanded and erected for use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The framework includes a plurality of upright support members the adjacent ones of which are connected by means of scissor assemblies comprising either single or dual scissor units connected in end-to-end relation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">A problem experienced by that structure (and that shown in US Patent No 4 607 656 issued to one Carter) is that the edge scissor assemblies which extend between adjacent support members are often subjected to lateral forces which tend to decrease their stability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">That structure was improved by his US Patent No 4 779 635 (referred to as 'Lynch 3' in these proceedings).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The canopy structure there referred to biased its corner support members so that the framework was placed in tension, as opposed to compression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The structure shown in his U.S. Patent No 4 947 884 ( 'Lynch 2' ), whilst workable, also had the disadvantages indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In an effort to further stabilise the structure and meet those problems he developed a stabilisation bar, but it added complexity to the structure and increased its weight and manufacturing costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He identified a need to simplify: 
 
 'the mounting of the scissor bar elements, one to another into scissor units and the resulting scissor units into interconnected scissor or truss assemblies, and in the connection of such truss assemblies in a pivotal expandable/collapsible manner to respective corner and intermediate supports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">There is further a recognized need for interconnections which would be more resistive to shear and bending moments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 

7 The stated objects of the invention are consistent with the explanations to this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The consistory clauses follow: 
 
 'According to the present invention, then, an expandable framework structure is provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">This framework structure is adapted to be folded and stored and in a collapsed state and erected in an expanded state on a support surface in order to support a canopy covering above the support surface.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The expandable framework broadly includes a plurality of upright support members each having a bottom end positionable on the support surface and a top end opposite the bottom end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the collapsed state, the support members are oriented alongside one another but are moveable outwardly apart from one another towards the expanded state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 A plurality of edge scissor assemblies form truss members for the expandable framework with there being an edge scissor assembly interconnecting adjacent ones of the support members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Each edge scissor assembly has a pair of outer upper ends and a pair of outer lower ends, a plurality of novel mounts are disposed on the upright support members to fasten the edge scissor assemblies thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">To this end, each of the mounts have sockets formed therein by spaced-apart facing sidewall portions so that the outer ends of the edge scissor assemblies may be captured in respective one of the sockets in close fitted engagement between the facing sidewall portions thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A fastening pin pivotally secures each outer end portion of each edge scissor assembly in its respective socket ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

8 It is then explained that the mounts are moveable with respect to each other; where a pair of mounts are positioned on an upright support member, one mount is stationary while the other is slideable (a sliding mount).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The sockets and mounts provide pivotal connections for the scissor bars, without being compressive; the sidewalls act to resist lateral and torsional deflections of the outer end portions of the edge scissor assemblies and thus the scissor assemblies themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In the preferred structure a floating mount, also having the sockets and fastening pins referred to, is used to connect the scissor units together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In its collapsed state the stationary and floating mounts at the framework end create an uninterrupted first rim and the sliding and floating mounts at the other end create a second rim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There follows drawings and a detailed description of the preferred embodiment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It is said in conclusion: 
 
 'Accordingly, the present invention has been described with some degree of particularity directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It should be appreciated, though, that the present invention is defined by the following claims construed in light of the prior art so that modifications or changes may be made to the preferred embodiment of the present invention without departing from the inventive concepts contained herein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 

9 These proceedings concern claims 1, 2 and 8 to 23 of the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The independent claims are claims 1, 18, and 23: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>

 (a) a plurality of upright support members each having a bottom end positionable on the support surface and a top end opposite said bottom end, said support members oriented alongside one another in the collapsed state and movable outwardly apart from one another toward the expanded state; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a plurality of edge scissor assemblies with there being an edge scissor assembly interconnecting adjacent ones of said support members, each said edge scissor assembly having a pair of outer upper ends and a pair of outer lower ends, said edge scissor assemblies operative to open and close whereby said framework structure may move between the expanded and contracted states; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) a plurality of mounts disposed on said upright supports and operative to fasten said edge scissor assemblies thereto, said mounts each having sockets formed therein by spaced-apart, parallel sidewall portions, said edge scissor assemblies each having outer end portions of rectangular cross-section received in a respective one of said sockets in a close-fitted engagement between the parallel facing sidewall portions thereof thereby forming planar contact surfaces with said parallel sidewall portions; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) a fastening pin pivotally securing each outer end of said edge scissor assemblies in the respective socket, said mounts being relatively movable with respect to one another to allow said edge scissor assemblies to open and close as said framework structure expands and contracts while the parallel sidewalls of the sockets may act on the outer end portions along the planar contact surfaces to resist lateral and torsional deflections of said edge scissor assemblies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">' 
 

10 Claims 2 to 14 are dependent upon claim 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I will refer to features of the dependant claims generally in connexion with the issue of novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The focus in these proceedings is upon the references in claim 1, to parallel sidewall portions; the close-fitted engagement; the planar contact surfaces formed and how they act together 'to resist lateral and torsional deflections' of the edge scissor assemblies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">These references are repeated in claim 18, which adds the word 'mated' to the term close-fitted engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">That claim is in these terms: 
 
 
 '18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">An expandable framework structure adapted to be folded and stored in a collapsed state and erected in an expanded state on a support surface whereby said framework structure may support a canopy covering above said support surface, comprising: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a plurality of upright corner support members each having a bottom end positionable on the support surface and a top end opposite said bottom end, said corner support members oriented alongside one another in the collapsed state and movable outwardly apart from one another toward the expanded state;

11 Claims 19, 20, 21 and 22 are dependent upon claim 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">12 Claim 23 refers to a structure similar to that in claim 1 but includes the feature that the fastening pin pivotally securing the edge of the scissor assemblies to the support members is non-compressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">This feature is also found in claim 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It may be noted however that the word 'parallel' is not used in connection with the sidewalls referred to in claim 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">They are referred to as 'facing' :
 
 '23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">An expandable framework structure adapted to be folded and stored in a collapsed state and erected in an expanded state on a support surface whereby said framework structure may support a canopy covering above said support surface, comprising: 
 
 
 
 (a) a plurality of upright support members each having a bottom end positionable on the support surface and a top end opposite said bottom end, said support members oriented alongside one another in the collapsed state and movable outwardly apart from one another toward the expanded state; 
 (b) a plurality of edge scissor assemblies with there being an edge scissor assembly interconnecting adjacent ones of said support members, each said edge scissor assembly having a pair of outer upper ends and a pair of outer lower ends, said edge scissor assemblies operative to open and close whereby said framework structure may move between the expanded and contracted states;

 (d) a non-compressive fastening pin pivotally securing each outer end of said edge scissor assemblies in the respective socket , said mounts being relatively movable with respect to one another to allow said edge scissor assemblies to open and close as said framework structure expands and contracts while the sidewalls of the sockets resist lateral and torsional deflections of said edge scissor assemblies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 

13 Claims 15, 16 and 17 are dependent upon claim 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It was suggested by the applicants' patent attorney that claim 15 should not be said to be dependent upon later claims and claims 16 and 17 should be renumbered to follow claim 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">No amendment was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">THE SKILLED PERSON 
 
14 The applicant called two engineers: Dr Kneen, a structural engineer, who has experience in the design of collapsible shade and other structures and Dr Gilmore, a mechanical engineer who has experience in the design of various mechanisms and structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">That experience includes the design of a collapsible shade structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Dr Kneen's evidence was referrable to the issue of infringement of the applicant's patent and Dr Gilmore's to issues relating to invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The evidence of another witness sought to be relied on by the applicants, their patent attorney, was not accepted as relevant to the understanding of a skilled person, so far as it was relevant to the question of construction of the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Dr Kneen in any event adopted much of this evidence as accurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The respondent called Mr McKinnon, whose background included a business which sold awnings and shade structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">He also conceived of a collapsible shade structure and manufactured and sold a version of it from 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">It and its prototype are relevant to the issues of novelty and obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The respondent also called an engineer experienced in product design, Mr Kennard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Kennard is also the author of some inventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Of itself this is not a disqualifying factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">15 The identification of the skilled reader, to whom the patent is addressed, (being a hypothetical, skilled but non-inventive, worker in the field covered by the patent to whom the invention would be of interest) was discussed in the joint expert report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It was said that there was general agreement that such a person would include a person in the blind, awning and/or tent industries with a practical knowledge of installation and manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The respondents submit that this is too wide and that a person interested in the mount, the subject of the patent, and the problems they sought to overcome, would be a person involved in their design and manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This was the initial position taken by Drs Kneen and Gilmore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The respondents add that Mr McKinnon is a person within this description, relying upon his experience in designing his canopy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">16 The hypothetical skilled person is a person acquainted with the surrounding circumstances of the state of the art and manufacture at the relevant time: Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 1; [2001] HCA 8 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">They are likely to have a 'practical interest in the subject matter of the invention' : Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 at 242 and may often work in the art with which the invention is connected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Persons working in the awning, tent and shade structure business might be said to be interested in the method of attachment to the structure identified in the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It seems to me however that it is more clearly addressed to a person concerned with the particular problem it identifies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Such a person would be someone called upon to design such a structure and its components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Mr McKinnon's own use of an engineer to refine his prototype for production tends to confirm this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I accept however that there may be persons, not necessarily qualified as engineers, whose experience would provide them with the necessary knowledge and understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">As the Full Court pointed out in Jupiters Ltd v Neurizon Pty Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 86; [2005] FCAFC 90 at [67] , much evidence is admissible from persons who do not precisely answer the description of the hypothetical skilled person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Some may be more skilled in the relevant art than others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is for the court, having admitted relevant evidence, to come to a conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">INFRINGEMENT 
 
17 The invention the subject of the patent is for a new combination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The applicants must show that the two products which the respondents imported and sold have taken 'each and every one of the essential integers ' of the claims, in order to establish infringement: Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 at 246; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 at 475.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">18 It would appear that the first of the two versions of the 'Caravan Instant Shelter' ('Product A') was imported and sold by the second respondents in a period from about September 2000 to mid November 2002 and by the first respondent from some time prior to May 2002 to February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The respondents admit that Product A has all of the essential integers of the claims in question, as earlier mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">19 The second version ('Product B') is said to have been imported and sold by the first respondent from May 2002 and by the second respondent from 15 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It has all the features of Product A, and therefore of the relevant claims, except that one of the sidewalls of the brackets on the fixed and sliding mounts is inclined away from the other sidewall and it has a rib.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The general consensus is that the extent of the inclination is about 8 degrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">20 The respondents' principal contention is that these features of Product B mean that the integers of parallel facing sidewall portions of the mounts and planar contact surfaces are missing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The two integers cannot be taken separately, for claims 1 and 18 make plain that the parallel sidewalls are to form planar contact surfaces for the purpose of resisting lateral and torsional deflections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">There does not appear to be any dispute about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Claim 23 does not have these integers, but does require that there be a close-fitted engagement between the sidewall and the end of the member of the scissor assembly that is inserted into the socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The respondents contend this produces a similar requirement and is not met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">21 The other aspect of the invention is the use of a non-compressive pin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The respondents' Product B uses a screw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">I shall refer to the respondents' argument in connection with this point of difference after dealing with the main issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">22 The question whether there has been infringement is determined by the construction of the claims: Olin v Super Cartridge 180 CLR at 246.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The claims are construed in the context of the specification as a whole, but that does not permit the limits of the monopoly claimed to be expanded by adding to the words of a claim glosses drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 at 610.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">23 In construing the patent specification the court is to place itself in the position of the person to whom it is addressed: Kimberly-Clark v Arico [2001] HCA at [24].</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The specification is to be read in the light of common general knowledge before the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is accepted that experts can give evidence as to the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical terms and phrases and unusual or special meanings which would be given by them to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It is however the court's task to construe the specification: Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 at 485-486; Jupiters v Neurizon 65 IPR at [67].</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">
 
24 The respondents submit that, in determining the question whether there has been infringement, regard should be had to the words of the claims alone, following the 'purposive' approach to the construction of patents suggested by Lord Diplock in Catnic [1982] RPC 183.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">It is not correct, and contrary to such an approach, to identify the 'substance' or the pith and marrow of the invention and determine the issue of infringement on that basis, it is submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The respondents view such an approach as non-textual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That approach, drawn from Clarke v Adie (1875) LR 10 Ch App 667 at 675, is not consistent with Catnic [1982] RPC 183, which changed the law in this area, it is submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">This latter fact was recognised by Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd (2000) 177 ALR 231; 49 IPR 225; [2000] FCA 980 and more recently by Hoffman LJ in Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444; [2004] UKHL 46 (at [42]), it was submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In each case it was considered that a purposive construction, particularly one given effect to by the questions posed in Improver Corporation v Remmington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 at 189, leaves no area of operation for a pith and marrow approach (see also PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41; 64 IPR 314; [2005] FCA 344).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The respondents also point to the recognition by Lindgren J of the 'tension' between two ideas in the construction of patent claims: the idea that a person should be able to take the substance of the invention and avoid infringement by side-stepping the language of the claims and the idea that the language of patent claims sets the boundaries of the monopoly and ought not to be extended by the courts to catch that which the patentee has left open: Breville Pty Ltd v Warehouse Group (Australia) Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 576; [2005] FCA 1893 at [40] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It would follow from the respondents' submission that the first mentioned idea reflects the 'pith and marrow' approach but that the latter is the correct approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">25 Two recent decisions of this Court confirm that the identification of the substance, or essence, of an invention and its use in connection with allegations of infringement to be an incorrect method: Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 605 at [55] per Bennett J; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 220 at [38] - [43] and [92].</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">As the Full Court explained in Fresenius [2005] FCAFC 220 , it is an error of principle to ascertain the 'essence' of the invention to determine whether infringement has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Fresenius [2005] FCAFC 220 reiterated that the correct approach is to identify the essential integers and that the form and wording of the claim are determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The two decisions also make plain that the incorrect approach reflects a misunderstanding of what was envisaged by the doctrine of pith and marrow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">That doctrine has not been regarded by Australian courts as inconsistent with a proper approach to the construction of patent claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">26 The decision in Fresenius [2005] FCAFC 220 also confirms as correct the explanation of the course the law has taken in this area in Populin v HB Nominees 41 ALR 471, which was confirmed in Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1990) 161 IPR 545.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Populin v HB Nominees 41 ALR at 475 stressed the importance of a patentee distinguishing essential and inessential integers and claiming only the former, because it must be shown that the alleged infringee has taken each and every one of the essential integers of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">If one essential integer is omitted that person will escape liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">At the same time, it is explained, the courts sought to avoid too technical or narrow a construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Accordingly they held that the omission of an inessential step or part, or the substitution of an equivalent (an immaterial variation) would not provide an escape from infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Considerations such as this led to the pith and marrow test, expressed in the classic statement in Clarke v Adie (1875) LR 10 Ch App at 675.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">After commenting that a patent for a new combination is entitled to the same protection as every other patent James LJ said: 
 
 '...The patent is for the entire combination, but there is, or may be, an essence or substance of the invention underlying the mere accident of form; and that invention, like every other invention, may be pirated by a theft in a disguised or mutilated form, and it will be in every case a question of fact whether the alleged piracy is the same in substance and effect, or is a substantially new or different combination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">' 
 

27 The doctrine has continued to be recognised by the High Court, Populin v HB Nominees 41 ALR 471 observes at 476 (and see Olin v Super Cartridge [1977] HCA 23 ; 180 CLR 236 at 246 per Gibbs J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">It has its limitations, however.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">As Gibbs J said in Olin v Super Cartridge [1977] HCA 23 ; 180 CLR 236 , the doctrine does not mean that there will be an infringement where the patentee has, in the form of the claim, left open that which the alleged infringee has done; and it does not affect the fundamental rule that there will be no infringement unless all of the essential features or integers of the claim were taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">28 Turning to the reading of the complete specification, the Full Court in Populin v HB Nominees 41 ALR 471 pointed out that the essential integers are to be determined not by an abstract and uninformed construction, but by a common sense assessment of what the words used convey in the context of the then existing published knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It is in this connection that the Court referred (at 476-477) to the decision in Catnic [1982] PRC 183 and in particular the statement by Lord Diplock (at 242-243): 
 
 '...a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (ie 'skilled in the art'), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute the so-called 'pith and marrow' of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 

29 In Nicaro Holdings 161 IPR 545 Gummow J observed (at 560) that the point at issue in Catnic [1982] PRC 183 was an integer which spoke of a rear support member, in building construction, 'extending vertically' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The alleged infringer had the member inclined at 6 or 8 degrees from the vertical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The reduction had a negligible effect on function and the House of Lords found infringement, as would an Australian court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">His Honour did not consider that Catnic [1982] PRC 183 propounded any novel principle or created a new category of 'non-textual infringement' (see also Fresenius v Gambro [2005] FCAFC at [91]; Pharmacia Italian SpA v Mayne Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (2005) 661 IPR 84 at 98 and see the cases there cited).</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">30 In Catnic [1982] PRC 183 the solution proposed by Lord Diplock was a construction which gave effect to what the skilled addressee would understood to be the protection claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The question identified by Lord Diplock (at 243) was whether a skilled addressee would understand that strict compliance with a word or phrase was intended to be an essential requirement, so that any variant would fall outside the claim, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">That question did not however arise if the variation had a material effect or if that would have been obvious to the informed reader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">31 The views expressed by Lord Diplock, that the essential features of a claim are what is referred to as the 'pith and marrow' and that they are to be determined by reference to the words of the claim, and not by some intuitive process, may also be seen as reflected in the statement of the High Court in Radiation Ltd v Galliers &amp; Klaerr Pty Ltd [1938] HCA 17 ; (1938) 60 CLR 36 at 51 that, in connection with infringement, consideration must be given to 'the substantial idea disclosed by the specification and made the subject of a definite claim ' (emphasis added, as it was by the Full Court in Fresenius v Gambro [2005] FCAFC at [50]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">32 The decision in Fresenius v Gambro [2005] FCAFC at [91] confirms that both Populin v HB Nominees 41 ALR 471 and Catnic [1982] RPC 183 stand for the proposition that the essential integers of claims are determined by a common sense assessment of what the words of the claims convey in the context of then-existing knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The cases show that the principle of the pith and marrow is concerned with the identification of what is essential and inessential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Where the omission or substitution in the alleged infringing article is not of an essential feature, the variation is immaterial and a conclusion of infringement may follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">33 It is convenient at this point to refer to the drawing by Dr Kneen of the mount on Product B, absent his explanations noted on it: 
 
 
34 The square space to the right of the letters is identified by Dr Kneen as that for the vertical corner post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The focus here is upon the socket where A and B, on the one hand, and C, on the other, are the sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The inclined sidewall with rib is shown at A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The outer end portion of the scissor assemblies (or truss as it is also referred to) is inserted into the socket and held in place with a screw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">35 Claim 1 of the patent in suit envisages the sockets of the mounts being formed by sidewalls which are spaced apart and parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The outer end portions of the scissor assemblies are held closely in the socket between the sidewalls which are 'parallel facing' in a 'close-fitted engagement' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The end portions of the scissor assemblies 'thereby ' form 'planar contact surfaces' with the sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The sidewalls, it is said, 'may act' on the outer end portions 'along the planar contact surfaces' to 'resist lateral and torsional deflections' of the scissor assemblies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Claim 18 repeats the reference to the sockets having spaced-apart parallel sidewalls in connection with both the stationary and sliding mounts, the close-fitted engagement and the sidewalls acting along the planar contact surfaces in order to resist deflections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">36 The respondents concede that the word 'parallel' in the claims would not be understood by a person skilled to refer to the sidewalls being precisely geometrically parallel, but rather parallel within manufacturing tolerances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Dr Gilmore, in dealing with the issue of fair basing, said that a geometric parallel sidewall could not be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The claim would be understood to say 'reasonably parallel ' and consistent with the structure working as described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">37 The applicants' witnesses did not attempt to put a figure upon what would be 'reasonably parallel' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Mr McKinnon suggested that anything more than an inclination of 5 degrees from the other sidewall could not be considered to be parallel and could not function as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It may easily be inferred from the claims that the requirement of parallelism is not to be read on its own and without reference to function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The focus then shifts to the formation of the planar contact surfaces and what is necessary to achieve this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The respondents did not deny such an approach, but submitted that the function of forming planar contact surfaces reinforces the meaning of parallel as being as close to parallel as can be achieved in manufacturing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">38 Dr Kneen gave evidence as to the importance of the contact sought to be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">He explained that the improvement sought in the behaviour of the mount, as seen in the specifications, the resistance of lateral and torsional deflection, is to be achieved by restraining the rectangular end portions of the scissor assemblies against rotation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">This involves the end coming into contact with the sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The essential element is claimed to be the presence of planar contact surfaces on the sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">39 Mr McKinnon did not consider that the inclined side and rib of Product B provided a planar contact surface.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Although he conceded that the end portion of the scissor assemblies would sit straight in the socket of Product B, and that it would be parallel with the other sidewall, he did not see this as achieving the same effect as a socket having sidewalls which were both parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr McKinnon pointed out that, if the gap between the two points of contact (A and B on Dr Kneen's drawing) was too great, it would allow for lateral and torsional deflection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">He did not say however that this variation in Product B had the result that its function was different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I infer that it does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Mr McKinnon's point was that the inclined wall and rib provided for contact points , not contact surfaces .</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">He considered that the latter required the contact to be continuous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">40 Dr Gilmore was of the view that the gaps created by the angle of the sidewall in Product B maintained a reasonably planar surface.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The applicants' case as to this feature, as with that of parallel sidewalls, was that there is a tolerance permitted by the claims when regard was had to their function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">41 Dr Kneen pointed out that the contact surface between the end member of the scissor assemblies and the sidewall in the specification will not always be over the whole of the plane as it moves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">It may be at isolated points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The claim may imply that it is over a significant surface, but it does not say that it has to be over the whole plane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">He would define a planar contact surface as a series of points that form a plane on which contact can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Dr Gilmore considered that the angle of the sidewall in Product B maintained a reasonably planar surface.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">42 Dr Kneen observed that the claim did not require the planar contact surfaces to be the parallel sidewalls of the sockets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The claims suggest that the planar surfaces could be the sides of the ends of the scissor members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The patent itself says that the sidewalls may act on the end portions along the planar contact surfaces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">I note that Mr McKinnon appears to have been alert to this question, but was not confident about the conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It seems to me that Dr Kneen's view is borne out by the language of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Dr Gilmore also referred to what the claims have to say about the end portion of the scissor assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It is not likely that it was predicted that it would always be entirely smooth and providing one continuous plane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">If it is, its surface, which is the point of contact, may come into contact at a number of points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The claims refer to contact surfaces .</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The plane may then be the side of the end portion itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The respondents submitted that if this were the case it is even more important that the sidewalls be as close to true parallel as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The evidence did not however suggest that a substantially parallel wall would act differently upon the end of the scissor assemblies in any significant way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">43 In reality the respondents' argument not only linked the requirements of the sidewall being parallel with the function of planar contact surfaces, it equated them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Once it is accepted that the claims see the end portion end of the scissor assembly providing the plane on which contact surfaces or points are provided, the remaining question is whether the sidewalls have to be as close to true parallel as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">This is not necessary for the behaviour of the mount sought to be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Substantially parallel will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">That is how the skilled addressee would understand the patent to require which regard was had to the function of the mount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The variation in Product B has no effect upon the function of the sidewall upon the end portion of the scissor assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">44 Claim 23 does not contain a requirement that the sidewalls be parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The respondents sought to resist a finding of infringement because there is only contact at two points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It was submitted that the integer, that there be a close-fitted engagement, is therefore missing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">There is however nothing which suggests Product B failed to achieve this objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">45 The respondents' approach to the requirement that there be a non-compressive fastening pin was curious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">There was no dispute that it was an essential integer of claim 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The respondents' witnesses accepted that the screw in Product B had the features of the pin referred to in the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Nevertheless the respondents in submissions reserved their position on infringement on the basis of the view expressed by Dr Gilmore, in connexion with the issue of anticipation, that the bolt utilised in Mr McKinnon's Original canopy did not anticipate the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The weight of the evidence however was that the screw in Product B functioned in the same way as the non-compressive pin in the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">46 Infringement of the independent claims 1, 18 and 23 has been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The respondents did not suggest that there was any feature of the dependant claims which excepted them from a finding of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The applicants have therefore established infringement of claims 1, 2 and 8 to 23 inclusive by each of Products A and B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">INVALIDITY 
 Fair Basis and Clarity 
 
47 Section 40(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ('the Act') requires the patent claims to be clear and succinct and fairly based upon the matter described in the specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">These requirements are often bound up with the question of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In the latter respect the respondents argue that if the claims are to be interpreted as including walls that are reasonably parallel, but not as parallel as technically possible, and do not create one planar surface between the inclined sidewall and the end portion of the scissor assembly, they travel beyond, and are not fairly based upon, the matter described in the specification: Kimberly Clark v Arico [2001] HCA at [15]; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [57] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">For this purpose an overly meticulous and verbal analysis is to be avoided: Synthetic Turf Development Pty v Sports Technology International Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 475; [2005] FCAFC 270 at [26] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The question is whether there is a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed, so that the alleged invention as claimed can be said, in a general sense, to be described in the body of the specification: Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95 per Gummow J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">48 The respondents submit that it is clear from the patent specification that the invention contemplates continuous contact over the entire plane between each inside wall and the side of the end portion of the assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">It is this feature that is described in the specification as providing the resistance against lateral and torsional deflection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The specification does not contemplate one sidewall parallel with the end portion and having planar contact with it but, on the other side, contact at only two points and not over the planar surface of the sidewall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">49 The respondents rely upon the preferred embodiment described in the specification (pages 12-15) in their particulars of invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It is submitted that it is there made clear that the sidewalls are required to be parallel so that there are planar contact surfaces between the sidewalls and the outer ends of the assembly in order to resist deflection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">A reference to the preferred embodiments in this regard shows that they are concerned with floating and central mounts having parallel sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The end portions of the scissor assemblies are said to fit into a socket having 'spaced-apart' sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">It is said that it is due to the close fitted engagement with the end portions in the sockets that planar contact surfaces are formed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The latter feature is not attributed to the sidewalls being parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">50 In any event the specification should not be construed as disclosing an invention limited to the preferred embodiment where there is a statement that it is not so limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In such a case the consistory clause may be treated as disclosing the invention: Rehm v Websters Security 81 ALR at 94-95 ; Lockwood Security v Doric Products 217 CLR at [93].</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The specification in the patent in suit contains such a statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The consistory clause describes the sockets of the mounts as having 'spaced-apart facing sidewall portions' so that the end portions of the scissor assemblies may be captured in close-fitted engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The invention so described does not have geometrically parallel-sided sockets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">51 The respondents also allege that claims 1, 8, 12 and 18 are invalid because two phrases lack clarity: 'close-fitted engagement' and 'planar contact surfaces'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">If 'planar contact surfaces' is to be interpreted to include contact at discrete points, then the phrase is not clear, it is submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">With regard to 'close-fitted engagement' (and 'close-fitted mated engagement' ) the phrases are said not to be clear because there is no limitation on how far apart the components can be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">52 The applicants point out that mere generality of language in a claim is not fatal, so long as the claim indicates the territory which is forbidden: Adhesives Pty Ltd v Aktieselskabet Dansk Gaerings-Industri [1934] HCA 71 ; (1935) 55 CLR 523 at 546.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">A claim is not ambiguous if a skilled addressee, applying common sense and common knowledge, can resolve it: Innovative Agriculture Products Pty Ltd v Cranshaw (1996) 35 IPR 643.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">53 In reality the respondents' argument concerning 'planar contact surfaces' was that it was capable of bearing a meaning which did not imply unbroken contact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">This does not establish a lack of clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There is nothing unclear about an engagement between the sidewalls of the socket and the end portion of a scissor assembly being close-fitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">This is particularly so when regard is had to the purpose, namely that contact surfaces be provided in order to resist deflection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Clearly enough a gap which would cut across that objective is to be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">An engagement which is 'mated' is one which would be well understood to a skilled addressee, as it would to almost any person in a mechanical workshop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Novelty 
 
54 Whether an invention is novel requires comparison with the prior art base: ss 18(1) and 7 (1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">(The amendments of s 7 and the dictionary definition of 'prior art base' effected by Act No 160 of 2001 do not apply to this patent).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The respondents rely upon four prior patents as anticipating the patent in suit: the two Lynch patents referred to in the patent in suit ( 'Lynch 2' and 'Lynch 3' ) and another, US Patent No 4 885 891 ( 'Lynch 1' ), together with US Patent 402 755 ( 'Lyon' ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">They also pleaded two instances of prior use in Australia before the priority date: the use of a collapsible canopy designed by Mr McKinnon (referred to as his 'Original' canopy), that use including its use at public events such as motocross races and jetski races; and the commercial sale and use of a collapsible canopy under the trademark Quikshade by the company with which Mr McKinnon and his father were associated, Summercraft Blind &amp; Awning Company Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">I did not understand the respondents to press reliance upon the Quikshade canopy, however, since it does not employ a two-sided socket such as that shown in the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It may remain relevant to the question of common general knowledge, particularly in connection with obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">55 The test for anticipation, or want of novelty, is 'reverse infringement' : Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 235.</sentence>

<sentence id="s259">Lynch 1 --- (US Patent No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">4 885 891) 
 
57 There was general agreement that this patent did not clearly disclose non-compressive pins for use in the sockets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">These pins are referred to in claims 15, 16, 17 and 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">There was a further issue as to whether sliding mount 55 in Figure 8 disclosed sockets formed by spaced-apart parallel sidewall portions (claims 1, 18 and 23 and dependant claims).</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Dr Gilmore did not consider that it was possible to reach any conclusion regarding the structure of the mount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Both Mr Kennard and Mr McKinnon agreed that it was difficult to determine its structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Mr McKinnon's statement that it was 'clear enough' to him does not provide sufficient certainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Mr Kennard deduced that they might be parallel by reference to other, unnumbered, mounts which he thought had inside walls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He inferred that what was depicted was an apparatus with a U-shaped socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Clearly enough Mr Kennard has made an assumption which a skilled addressee would not make without a more specific drawing or explanation, as Dr Gilmore points out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Lynch 2 - (US Patent No 4 947 884) 
 
58 At issue with respect to this patent was whether parallel sidewall portions were disclosed by a pair of ears (col 6, l 30-40; fig 6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">There was general agreement, disclosed in the joint expert report, about whether mount 70 on Figure 6 had two ears, but disagreement about how the drawing should be interpreted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Mr McKinnon thought that it had two ears, but Mr Kennard thought that one pair of ears was disclosed at right angles --- in essence and L-shaped socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Mr Kennard also observed that the figure showed a socket (74) where the front wall and part of the back wall can be seen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">These are referred to in the specifications as 'pairs of ears' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">He reads the drawing as showing the front and back walls as parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">He also understands the patent, in describing other sockets as pairs of ears, to suggest that they too comprise parallel-facing sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Dr Gilmore agreed that the description of the socket was of facing sidewalls, but did not consider that it was sufficiently clear for a conclusion that they were parallel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It seems to me, again, that Mr Kennard and Mr McKinnon may have expected this to be the case that this is not sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The patent refers only to a 'pair of ears' and goes no further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">It follows, in Dr Gilmore's view, that planar contact surfaces are not disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">It seems to me that Dr Gilmore is correct; and that Mr Kennard's reading of the patents requires assumptions that a skilled addressee would not make without more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">59 Two other features are absent from Lynch 2: the structure disclosed is not a roof support assembly extending between and connected to at least one pair of facing edge scissor assemblies (claim 10); and it does not have an edge scissor assembly including a 'pair of scissor units connected' by floating mounts (claim 8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Dr Gilmore also suggested, at one point in his evidence, that the feature of a non-compressive fastening pin was not present in the Lynch 2 patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The other evidence however makes plain that bolts, which are clearly disclosed, can operate in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Lynch 3 --- (US Patent 4 779 635) 
 
60 The principal issue here was whether the sliding mounts shown as connected to the end scissor assemblies with 'L-shaped' sockets are the same as disclosed in the specification of the patent in suit, which are in the nature of U-shaped brackets having parallel facing sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Lynch 3 does not disclose a roof support assembly which includes an internal scissor assembly extending between and connected to at least one pair of facing edge scissor assemblies (claim 10).</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">61 The specification on Lynch 3 (col 5, l55) refers to a U-shaped bracket mounted to a corner support member and an L-shaped socket (which is taken to be effectively one-sided) to a corner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Mr Kennard understood the specification to convey that the socket on the mount used to attach the scissor end has only one side and the socket on the mount used to attach the roof truss has two sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Whilst the sockets used to attach the ends of the scissor assemblies do not have parallel sidewalls, as the patent in suit requires, but only a single sidewall, he considers that, because Lynch 3 discloses sockets having two sidewalls for use in attaching the roof truss, it would be a matter of routine to adapt the sockets for attaching the scissor assembly to be two-sided as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Mr Kennard has not addressed the correct question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">As Dr Gilmore points out, it is not whether, in an engineering sense, this other application could be deduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Application of the mount used for attaching the roof truss represents a different engineering feature of the structure and, importantly, is not taught by this patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Lyon --- (US Patent No 402 755) 
 
62 This discloses slots (L) which are described as receiving cross-bars or other connecting parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It is difficult therefore to understand that the slots did not function as sockets, as Dr Gilmore suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">There was general agreement that the slots had parallel sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The document does not however disclose a pin, as referred to in claims 1 and 23, passing through the slots and end portions inserted into them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It utilises wires or chords which lie in grooves at the end of the brackets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The wires are said to constitute axes upon which intersecting parts are to hinge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">That is the only description provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The respondents submit that it must be inferred that the wire must go through the cross-bar or other connecting part which is inserted into the slots and then pivot in the same way as the pin, which passes through the sockets and the end of the scissor assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">This is not however apparent from the Lyon patent and Dr Gilmore did not accept that it was disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">The patent is dated 1889 and contains a limited description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He suggested another way in which the wire could have been threaded, namely on a groove on the inserted connecting part, utilising umbrella technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">This would not necessarily involve the wire acting as a pivot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">There is not a clear disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">63 It was also accepted that the features of upper and floating mounts (claim 8) and the internal scissor assembly connected to at least one pair of facing edge scissor assemblies (claim 10), were not anticipated by this patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">There was general agreement that the requirement of claim 23, that the pin be non-compressive, was not met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The Original Canopy 
 
64 In the early 1980's Summercraft Blind &amp; Awning Co began to sell and install an awning which attached to the side of a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">It folded, concertina style, and had a scissor arrangement which enabled it to expand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">At this time Mr McKinnon was involved in motocross and jetski racing events and needed a shelter for his equipment and tools.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">From 1984 he made a number of prototypes of a collapsible canopy with four upright metal posts and scissor trusses between each post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">There are no copies of the Original in existence and the only photographs said to be of it do not show how the scissor assembly was attached to the uprights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">65 The applicants submit that Mr McKinnon's evidence needs to be closely scrutinized in these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">So much may be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">It does not however entirely lack corroboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Mr McKinnon's earlier evidence about how he made U-shaped brackets which attached the scissor truss ends to each post was somewhat unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">He suggested that they were formed by a piece of metal shaped into a 'U' by fitting it around a post and that the bracket extended beyond the upright posts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">His methods may have changed because of the number of prototypes he made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">In any event he eventually went to Mr Soward, a metal fabricator, to weld the parts to the posts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Mr Soward does not now recall their shape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">His employee, Mr Forster, recalls them being made from U-shaped channels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It may be inferred from Mr McKinnon's evidence that one was added to the top of the upright post to form a stationary mount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Mr Forster recalls a sliding mount on the post which was comprised of a U-shaped bracket which he welded to a piece of square hollow section of metal which slid along the post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The brackets had holes in either sides, through which a bolt could be threaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">It appears elsewhere from the evidence that the bolt was threaded only part of the way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">This has an effect upon its function to which reference shall be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Mr McKinnon's evidence was that he used a nylon washer on either side of the end of the scissor end because the two sides of the socket were slightly larger than the width of the end and to 'take up the slack' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">He thinks that the washers were about 1 mm thick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">66 Mr Forster gave evidence that he worked only on a section of the canopy but that Mr McKinnon showed him the final product, of which there is a photograph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">He does not recall how the components were utilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">67 Mr McKinnon believes that he started taking the canopy to races in 1987, and possibly before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In his initial evidence he spoke of other competitors, friends and members of the public seeing the canopy and expressing interest in it, indeed being intrigued by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">He loaned the prototype to friends when he was not attending the races himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">He identified one family to whom he loaned the canopy, the McPhersons, and gave evidence that a photograph in evidence was of the canopy that he had loaned to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">He says that he was asked to make and sell copies of the canopy but he was busy and did not think that it was worth his while.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">In 1987 a friend returned from the United States of America with a copy of an advertisement made by another company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">He then became interested in manufacturing his canopy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">He took his prototype to a product engineer, Mr Dawes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Mr Dawes designed a system which clipped together and had injected moulded plastic mounts different in shape from his prototype.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">He applied for a patent in November 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The Quikshade canopy was manufactured and sold from 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Neither it nor the patent are relied upon as anticipating the patent in suit but as forming part of common general knowledge in connexion with the issue of obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Despite its commercial success Mr McKinnon was not satisfied with its strength and stability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">In 1995 he redesigned the brackets to have a single wall on each side of the bracket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">He sold the Quikshade business but remained as an employee until June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He no longer has any interest in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">68 Clearly enough Mr McKinnon's structure utilised U-shaped brackets which could be said to have parallel facing sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">A number of points of difference between the patent claims and his Original canopy were initially identified by the applicants, but it seemed to me that only two features remained in issue at the conclusion of the evidence --- whether a close-fitted engagement between the scissor truss ends and the U-shaped bracket was achieved when nylon washers were inserted between them; and whether the Original canopy collapses so that the stationary and floating mounts abut one another to form an uninterrupted rim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The feature of the non-compressive pin was met because the bolt utilised on the Original canopy operated in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It compressed only to the extent of its thread.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">69 The respondents submitted that the claims of the patent in suit could not be got around by the use of a small washer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Dr Gilmore's evidence was to the effect that it could prevent a close-fitted engagement, depending on the size of the gap it was meant to take up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">I did not however understand him to say that a gap of 1 mm would prevent that engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">That was the extent of the gap on the Original canopy and equates with what the patent discloses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">It may be that the washer was unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">It does not in any event alter the function of the socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">70 The Original canopy may be said to anticipate the claims of the patent in suit, save in one respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Mr McKinnon conceded that it did not collapse in such a way that an uninterrupted rim was formed (claim 14).</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Dr Gilmore identified it as a unique feature of the structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">I did not understand the respondents to contend that it was not essential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">They contended that it was obvious at the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">This contention is however only based upon the possibility that it might have been achieved on the Original by countersinking bolts once the idea was known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In any event it was not pleaded in connection with the issue of obviousness, to which I shall shortly turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">It remains to consider whether the Original canopy was made available to the public in the way required, on the footing that it did anticipate the patent's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">71 Mr McKinnon's earlier evidence may have established the availability of the canopy for inspection by members of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">His later evidence does not however make such a conclusion possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">He accepted that the photograph taken at the races of the canopy loaned to the McPhersons was of the later Quikshade canopy and conceded that he may never have loaned an Original canopy to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">When Mr McKinnon was reminded that he applied for a patent of the Original in late 1987 he retreated from his earlier evidence about making the canopy available at the races in the period prior to that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">He said that he had attempted to keep it from the public; that he erected it at the back of the pits and out of public view; that he sought to do so until it was patented and because he was conscious of the prospect of people taking his ideas; and that he was guarded about lending it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The possibility that he might have continued to use it after his application for the patent was not rendered more certain by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The Quikshade canopy which he did use appears to have been produced shortly afterwards, in 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">72 The only other evidence of disclosure upon which the respondents relied was of the Original canopy to Mr Forster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">It could not however be inferred that he was at liberty to make use of it, as is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The circumstances in which he was placed, and his or his employer's relationship with Mr McKinnon, suggest strongly that the information contained in it was confidential and could not be imparted to others or utilised by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Obviousness 
 
73 Section 18(1) of the Act, which commenced on 30 April 1991 requires a patentable invention to involve an inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The patent was applied for on 23 December 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The effect of s 7(2) is that it does not involve such a step if it would have been obvious to person skilled in the relevant art, in the light of common general knowledge as it existed before the priority date of the relevant claim, whether that knowledge is considered separately or together with the information referred to in subs (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">That subsection refers to one piece or two or a combination of pieces, of prior art information that the skilled person could reasonably be expected to have ascertained, understood and regarded as relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The skilled person for these purposes is assumed to be non-inventive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">74 As the High Court pointed out in Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2003) 212 CLR 411 at 423 at [21], in seeking to discharge the onus upon them, the party alleging invalidity must lead evidence looking back to the priority date, sometimes many years prior to trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The authorities are replete with warnings about the misuse of hindsight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">This danger is particularly acute where there is a new combination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">75 The respondents' case on obviousness had two approaches: it was assumed that common general knowledge extended to what was disclosed in the three prior Lynch patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Features of them, such as the use of scissor assemblies connected to vertical upright supports, could also be seen in the Lyon patent and the Quikshade canopy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Viewed from that perspective it would have been obvious to the skilled person that the attachment means could be changed to mounts having L-shaped or U-shaped sockets, the argument proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">They would provide greater strength and stability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">The other approach relied upon Mr Kennard's consideration of how he might design a component to connect an upright post and a horizontal post in such a way as to enable the latter to be free to slide along the upright post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">He had been instructed that the area for design concerned a problem with a collapsible canopy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The application of what he termed 'engineering principle' led him to a choice between a bracket with a U-shaped or L-shaped socket.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">76 Mr Kennard's evidence was that all of the features of the Lynch patents were known to skilled persons before the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">In particular scissor assemblies, vertical support posts for canopy roofs, the combination of stationary and sliding mounts, of U-shaped and L-shaped sockets in brackets used for attachment and the use of floating mounts and the use of non-compressive pins were all known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Dr Gilmore accepted that the discrete technologies which comprised the structure as described in these patents would have been common general knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">However, the knowledge that the specific types of discrete technology would combine well to make a practical and useable device would not be common general knowledge and would need to be 'taught' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Discrete technologies were put together in a particular and a unique way in each of the prior patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">There were a wide range of possibilities open to a person designing a structure such as this and that person would need to research and use their skill in design, he said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The assumption that all collapsible canopies would use scissor assemblies was incorrect, as some prior art documents confirm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Scissor mechanisms could be expected to be observed in various applications, but specific knowledge of how to apply them to advantage in making collapsible structures would not have been readily observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The use of sockets with parallel sidewalls to accommodate bars with ends of rectangular cross-section were known to help to prevent lateral and rotational distortion of the socket relative to the bar; but whether this assist in preventing distortion of a collapsible structure, while allowing the bar to pivot freely, would depend upon the details and geometry of the design of that structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">The respondents' case, it will be recalled, assumes that structure has been designed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">77 Mr Kennard's evidence was also strongly suggestive of hindsight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">It appeared to me that he was prepared to assume a greater knowledge of the type of structure in question than may have been the case at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">His starting point was his awareness 'for many years' of collapsible canopies used in Australia, at market stalls for example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Whilst he was directed to knowledge as it existed at the relevant date, it could not safely be concluded from his evidence that he took his mind back to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">By the time he turned his mind to the question of available knowledge he had had regard to the patents and prior art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">78 No reason is shown for rejecting the evidence of Dr Gilmore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">There is a basis for doubting the accuracy of Mr Kennard on this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">It follows that common general knowledge as it existed at the priority date should not be taken to have extended to the structures disclosed in the prior Lynch patents, nor the use of scissor assemblies as shown in the Lyon patent and the Quikshade canopy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">79 In addition to what was commonly known, s 7(3) also enquires whether the skilled person could reasonably be expected to have ascertained the prior art information in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Mr McKinnon said that the Quikshade canopy was sold mostly to motocross competitors in the period 1987 to the end of 1990 and he did not advertise it very much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">There is nothing to suggest that a person, such as an engineer undertaking the research to which Dr Gilmore refers, would have been alerted to its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">There were no journals in the awning and canopy industry and Dr Gilmore's evidence suggests that information of this kind was not likely to appear in engineering design journals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">In any event an inspection and observation of the canopy would have shown only the use of a scissor assembly connected to upright posts as one possibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">80 The Lyon patent also shows the use of a scissor assembly, but as Dr Gilmore explains this does not take one far towards the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">There is much to be determined in the detail of the design and its geometry before the design of the brackets is considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">The question which in any event arises with respect to it and the Lynch patents is whether they were available to be searched, and would have been searched, online by a design engineer at a time before the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">To the extent that the skilled person includes someone within the industry, it may be taken that they would not have routinely undertaken such a search.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In Commissioner of Patents v Emperor Sports Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 26 the question posed by the statute, and in particular that of ascertainability, was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">In many areas it may be assumed that the relevantly skilled person would be familiar with professional journals or other technical information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Unless an inference could be drawn, evidence would generally be required about what that person may reasonably be expected to have done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">There is no such evidence in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">81 The respondents' case on obviousness is based upon an assumption that the skilled person proceeds to design the attachment means of the edges of a scissor assembly to upright posts holding a canopy roof, on the basis that they are acquainted with the structures disclosed in the Lynch patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">That assumption is invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">If that assumption was correct they would in any event have failed to establish that the use of parallel-facing sidewalls, having the function and purpose disclosed in the patent, would have been obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Applying the test propounded in Aktiebolaget Hassel v Alphapharm 212 CLR at 433, at [53], the question is whether the skilled person, armed with the information provided by those patents would have been directly led, as a matter of course, to try a bracket having a socket with parallel facing sidewalls and using a non-compressive pin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">The latter assumes little importance if the socket is obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">In this regard it may be accepted that brackets having L-shaped and U-shaped sockets were part of common general knowledge at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">82 Dr Gilmore accepted that a person seeking to refine the structure in the prior Lynch patents might consider the use of brackets of this type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">That however assumes that knowledge of the structure so disclosed would mean that they would pursue that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">They might consider other possible structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">There are many possibilities and that in the Lynch patents is not mandated by design principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">The choice of other structures might lead the skilled person away from the brackets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The choice of the means of attachment depends so much on the geometry of the structure, as earlier mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">I also infer from Dr Gilmore's evidence that the prospect of a choice being presented assumes an identification of the problem of stability as the deficiency necessary to be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">It is not said how this would be apparent to a skilled person upon reading them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">83 Dr Gilmore gave evidence that there were other means available if it was desired to resist deflection of the scissor assemblies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">He identified one such method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Even if the skilled person understood the Lynch patents to be suggesting the use of the brackets having either L-shaped or U-shaped sockets, that did not mean that a non-inventive step was involved, in his view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">He saw the choice as itself inventive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">It may also be observed that if the skilled person thought that each of them were 'worth a try' it may beg the question posed by the statute: see Aktiebolaget Hassel v Alphapharm 212 CLR at [72].</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">84 Mr Kennard was given his design task by the respondent's lawyers prior to his seeing the patent in suit and the prior art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The description of the task and the questions arising in its course were however such that he was effectively directed to the use of brackets with sockets having parallel facing sidewalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">He was asked to design a 'component' to connect an upright post to the horizontal post in such a way as to enable the latter to be free to slide along the upright post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">He was asked to consider a socket connection which might pivot about a bolt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">He was then asked to consider ways to strengthen the connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">At that point he was asked to 'explain the general engineering principles behind using parallel facing sidewalls in sockets' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">If they improved strength he was asked to explain how.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The questions may have put the focus upon the strength and not stability but Mr Kennard was alert to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">In these circumstances I do not consider that his evidence in response to these instructions can carry any weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">85 The respondents' case on obviousness fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE 
 
86 Section 120 of the Act provides that infringement proceedings may be commenced by the patentee or an exclusive licensee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">An 'exclusive licensee' is defined in Sch 1 to mean a licensee under a licence granted by the patentee which confers upon the licensee, or persons authorised by them, the right to exploit the patented invention throughout the patent area to the exclusion of the patentee and all other persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">In their statement of claim the first, second and third applicants alleged that the third applicant, KD Kanopy Inc, is the legal assignee of the patent and that the first and second applicants, KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand, were at all relevant times the exclusive licensee from KD Kanopy Inc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">This was not admitted by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The issue has grown incrementally since the respondents were given leave to amend their defence to raise a positive case that KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand did not have an exclusive licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">87 Section 195(1) of the Act provides that the register is prima facie evidence of any particular noted upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand have been noted upon the register as exclusive licensees, pursuant to an agreement dated 24 December 1997, since 31 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The respondents contend that the terms of that agreement deny the necessary exclusivity in the first and second applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">88 The Distribution Agreement of 24 December 1997 was for a term of five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">By cl 1, KD Kanopy Inc granted to KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand the sole exclusive right to manufacture and distribute products known as the KD Majestic and KD Starshade in Australia and New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Those products are manufactured in accordance with the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The right was expressed to include the grant of sub-licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">An exception to the sole and exclusive right created by cl 1 was provided by cl 21.7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">It preserved the right of KD Kanopy Inc to continue to deal directly with Alishan Pty Ltd in New South Wales and any other customer as may be agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Clause 21 was expressed to prevail over cl 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Clause 19(f) provided that the agreement was not to be amended, altered, changed, modified, supplemented or rescinded in any manner except by a written agreement executed and acknowledged by the parties to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Clause 13 provided the distributor an option to renew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The terms of each renewal were to be the same as those contained in the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">89 The option to renew the agreement was exercised by KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand on 8 November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">90 There was a history to cl 21.7, as explained by Mr Dand and the representative of KD Kanopy Inc, Mr Matthews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">The KD Kanopy products had earlier been imported by the company Alishan and KD Kanopy Australasia purchased products from that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">In 1995 Mr Dand and Mr Matthews discussed the prospect of KD Kanopy Australasia manufacturing the products in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The first agreement between the parties concerning the manufacture and distribution of the products was entered into on 24 January 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Clause 9 of that agreement permitted KD Kanopy Inc to fulfil its existing contractual obligations to Alishan, although KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand became its suppliers after production commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">At the time cl 21.7 was written Mr Matthews had in mind relinquishing sales to Alishan when it was obvious that Alishan was comfortable in its dealings with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">91 On 24 March 1998 KD Kanopy Australasia and Mr Dand entered into a licence agreement for the distribution of the products with Kanopy Co, which is now the fourth applicant, Instant Marquee Systems Pty Ltd. That agreement recites that a licence is given to market, promote and distribute the products in Australia and New Zealand, but not in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">License agreements subsequently entered into by the first and second applicants, with other distributors or franchisees, do not extend to New South Wales, where it is said that the first and second applicants have a non-exclusive right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">92 Mr Dand explained that their agreement merely reflected the 1997 Distribution Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Subsequent to that agreement a further agreement was reached in a conversation with Mr Matthews sometime in 1998 or 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">That conversation concerned KD Kanopy Australasia and himself having the sole and exclusive rights of distributorship of the products and KD Kanopy Inc discontinuing its sales to Alishan or any one else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">At that point Alishan was already ordering nearly all of its products from KD Kanopy Australasia, Mr Matthews says.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Mr Dand says that he was motivated to make the request because he and KD Kanopy Australasia were about to expend considerable monies on further plant and equipment and he wished the security of exclusivity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Mr Matthews agreed to his request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">He and Mr Dand say that the companies have honoured that agreement, despite it not being reflected in the written Distribution Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">93 It is fair to say that this aspect of the case has taken some turns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In the end however it was reduced to a relatively narrow compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Clearly the first, second and third applicants were able to vary the agreement of December 1997 in the way they did, notwithstanding a clause such as cl 21.7 and the requirement of formality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The determining factor in such a circumstance is always the intention of the parties: Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Vic) Pty Ltd [1957] HCA 10 ; (1957) 98 CLR 93 at 144.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 involved a similar clause, which provided that there was to be no oral modification of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The question which arose was whether it rendered ineffective an oral or implied variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Justice Finn held that it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">His Honour observed that the usual objection raised in allowing oral modification, and the alteration of the variation clause, is that it involves a failure to give effect to what the parties had agreed (at [220]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">The question for the court however, as a United States commentator had observed, was whether to enforce the first or the second agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Common law courts chose the second.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">His Honour considered that this was of particular application to contracts which might be evolutionary in character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">94 The respondents do not now contend to the contrary of these views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Their case is that the Court should not accept the evidence of the later agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">They suggest that Mr Dand's evidence should be treated as unreliable because the oral agreement was not referred to until the respondents had identified the difficulty with the terms of cl 21; and because he did not volunteer the license agreement with the fourth applicant and those with other distributors at an earlier point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">These submissions overlook the way in which the matter developed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Mr Dand also explained that he and his wife, who found the document, had overlooked the existence of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">I do not find it difficult to accept that documents relating to entities controlled by a person may assume a lesser significance to them than other documents might.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">95 The respondents submit that the objective evidence strongly suggests that cl 2.17 remained operative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The terms of the sub-license agreements, which excluded distribution in New South Wales, remained the same throughout 2002 and 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Further, KD Kanopy Inc sold some products to the first respondent on two or three occasions in those years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">It appears that the goods were ordered by the first respondent directly from KD Kanopy Inc and shipped to it in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">They also submit that some inference adverse to the applicants should be drawn because Mr Matthews has not further commented upon these sales, or given evidence that there have been no others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">96 Mr Dand has explained, and I accept, that the license agreements were of a proforma type and no thought was given to whether they reflected the current state of affairs agreed to between the first, second and third applicants and put into effect by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">The evidence relating to the sales by KD Kanopy Inc to the first respondent is consistent with an oversight on its part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">The evidence is insufficient to permit an inference of conduct inconsistent with the oral agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Moreover, Mr Dand's electronic communications to Mr Matthews, when he realised that a competitor had KD Kanopy products, supports a conclusion that he and KD Kanopy Australasia held an exclusive license.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">The terms of his communications may be polite, but his concerns are clearly consistent with them having that right and KD Kanopy Inc no longer having the right to sell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Mr Matthews gave his evidence some months prior to reference being made to these sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">The respondents had not earlier referred to them despite being within their knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">On the state of the evidence I do not think it could be said to have been incumbent upon the applicants to have Mr Matthews provide a general rebuttal or further comment upon the two or three sales which had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">97 The first and second applicants had the exclusive licence to manufacture and distribute from some time after March 1998, prior to the dates of the alleged infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">They may therefore sue for infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The grant of the sub-licence is an incident of those rights and does not detract from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It was unnecessary to join the fourth applicant to the proceedings on the alternative basis that they may have obtained the exclusive license.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">CONCLUSION 
 
98 The respondents have not established a ground for holding the patent in suit invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Their cross-claim will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">They have conceded infringement of the patent by reference to their product A and the applicants have made out a case that the respondents' Product B also infringes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The respondents should pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings for infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">I will hear the parties as to the form of the orders, including that as to costs and as to directions necessary for the assessment of damages for 

infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">I certify that the preceding ninety-eight (98) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kiefel.</sentence>
