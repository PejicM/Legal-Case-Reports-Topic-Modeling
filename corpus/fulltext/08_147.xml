 Introduction 
 
1 The defendant in these proceedings, Mr Richard Albarran, was summoned to give evidence before the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board in a matter which was the subject of disciplinary proceedings before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The name of the person whose matter was before the Board is confidential and he will be referred to as "the Partner".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 Mr Albarran appeared before the Board on 7 February 2007 but he declined to answer certain questions that were put to him by the Panel Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 Section 219(2)(b) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("the ASIC Act ") provides that a person appearing as a witness at a hearing must not refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the Panel Chairperson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">This subsection does not apply to the extent that the person has a reasonable excuse: s 219(2A) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">5 The Panel Chairman certified in writing under s 219(6) of the ASIC Act that Mr Albarran had, when required by the Chairman to answer 37 questions specified in the certificate, refused or failed to comply with that requirement, without reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">6 The plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, seeks orders under s 219(7)(b) of the ASIC Act punishing Mr Albarran for his refusal or failure to answer the questions, in the same manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">7 The question which now arises is whether I am satisfied that Mr Albarran had a reasonable excuse for his refusal or failure to answer the questions: s 219(7) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Mr Albarran's excuse 
 
8 The reason put forward by Mr Albarran for declining to answer the questions is that he relied on legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That was not the reason he gave to the Panel Chairman on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On that occasion he told the Chairman that he believed that answering the questions may prejudice his interests in a separate matter that he had brought in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT").</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">9 That matter arose out of disciplinary proceedings that were determined adversely to Mr Albarran by the Board in December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Albarran sought a review of that determination by the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Albarran's proceeding in the AAT had not been heard at the time when he was summoned to give evidence in the Partner's matter before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">10 Mr Albarran and the Partner were both members of a firm of Chartered Accountants, Hall Chadwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I will set out the background facts in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is sufficient to say by way of introduction that the issues before the Board in both matters were substantially identical, each of them arising out of the voluntary administration of a company, Formula Engineering Pty Ltd, which was a client of Hall Chadwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">11 In Mr Albarran's disciplinary proceeding the Board found that he had been party to a contrived arrangement to appoint a person as voluntary administrator of Formula Engineering in circumstances in which Hall Chadwick and its members were precluded from taking that appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">12 The Board organised the disciplinary proceedings in respect of Mr Albarran and the Partner such that the two sets of proceedings were kept separate, and the Panels were constituted by different members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The legislation 
 
13 The Board is constituted under Division 1 of Part 11 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Its functions and powers include those conferred on it by s 1292 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): see s 204 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">14 Section 210A(1) of the ASIC Act provides that the Board's functions and powers in relation to an application to the Board by ASIC for a person to be dealt with under s 1292 of the Corporations Act are to be performed and exercised by a panel constituted under s 210A(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">15 Section 210A(2) of the ASIC Act provides that the Chairperson of the Board is to determine in writing the members of the Board who are to constitute the Panel that is to hear the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">16 Section 1292 of the Corporations Act confers powers on the Board, if it is satisfied on an application by ASIC, to cancel or suspend the registration of the person as an auditor or liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">17 Section 1292(2) of the Corporations Act deals with liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Section 1292(2)(d) provides:
 
 
 (2) The Board may, if it is satisfied on an application by ASIC for a person who is registered as a liquidator to be dealt with under this section that, before, at or after the commencement of this section: 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (d) that the person has failed, whether in or outside this jurisdiction, to carry out or perform adequately and properly: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the duties of a liquidator; or 
 (ii) any duties or functions required by an Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator; 
 
 
 
 
 
 by order, cancel, or suspend for a specified period, the registration of the person as a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 
 
 
 

18 Section 217(1) of the ASIC Act confers power on the Panel Chairperson to summon a person to give evidence at a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">19 Section 219 of the ASIC Act imposes an obligation upon a person served with a prescribed summons to appear as a witness before the Board, to attend and give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As I said in the introduction, the obligation is subject to the exception of "reasonable excuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The section contains the procedure, to which I have referred, for the Chairperson to give a certificate, and it confers power on the Court where a certificate is given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">20 I will set out the whole of s 219 of the ASIC Act as follows:
 
 Failure of witnesses to attend and answer questions 
 
 
 
 (1) A person served, as prescribed, with a summons to appear as a witness at a hearing must not: 
 
 
 (a) fail to attend as required by the summons; or 
 
 (b) fail to attend from day to day unless excused, or released from further attendance, by the Panel Chairperson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 
 
 
 
 (2) A person appearing as a witness at a hearing must not: 
 (a) when required pursuant to subsection 217(2) to either take an oath or make an affirmation--refuse or fail to comply with the requirement; or 
 (b) refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the Panel Chairperson; or 
 (c) refuse or fail to produce a document that he or she was required to produce by a summons under subsection 217(1) served on him or her as prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2A) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to the extent that the person has a reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 
 
 
 Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this subsection, see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) A person must not, at a hearing, give evidence that is false or misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 
 
 (4) A person must not contravene subsection (1), (2) or (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 
 Penalty: 10 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 (5) A person who contravenes subsection (3) is not guilty of an offence against subsection (4) if it is proved that he or she, when giving the evidence, believed on reasonable grounds that it was true and not misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 (6) Where the Panel is satisfied that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a person served, as prescribed, with a summons to appear as a witness at a hearing has, without reasonable excuse, failed to attend as required by paragraph (1)(a) or (b); or 
 (b) a person appearing as a witness at a hearing has, without reasonable excuse: 
 
 
 
 (i) when required pursuant to subsection 217(2) either to take an oath or make an affirmation; or 
 (ii) when required by the Panel Chairperson to answer a question; or 
 (iii) when required to produce a document by a summons under subsection 217(1) served on him or her as prescribed; 
 
 refused or failed to comply with the requirement; 
 
 
 
 the Panel Chairperson may, by instrument in writing, certify the failure to attend or the refusal or failure to comply with the requirement, as the case may be, to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 
 
 
 
 (7) Where a certificate is given under subsection (6), the Court may inquire into the case and, if it is satisfied that the person to whom the certificate relates has, without reasonable excuse, failed to attend or refused or failed to comply with a requirement as mentioned in the certificate: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) may order the person to attend or to comply with the requirement at a hearing to be held at a time and place specified in the order; or 
 (b) may punish the person in the same manner as if he or she had been guilty of contempt of the Court and, if it thinks fit, also make an order under paragraph (a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">" 
 
 
 

 21 Section 68 of the ASIC Act provides that for the purpose of Division 2 of Part 11 (which includes s 219) it is not a reasonable excuse for a person to refuse or fail to give information, in accordance with a requirement made of the person, that the information might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">22 The note appearing under s 219(2A) of the ASIC Act refers to s 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">That subsection is contained in Part 2.6 of the Criminal Code which deals with proof of criminal responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I will set out the relevant portions of that Part:
 
 13.1 Legal burden of proof--prosecution 
 
 
 
 (1) The prosecution bears a legal burden of proving every element of an offence relevant to the guilt of the person charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 Note: See section 3.2 on what elements are relevant to a person's guilt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 (2) The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 (3) In this Code: 
 legal burden , in relation to a matter, means the burden of proving the existence of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 
 
 13.2 Standard of proof--prosecution 
 
 
 
 (1) A legal burden of proof on the prosecution must be discharged beyond reasonable doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the law creating the offence specifies a different standard of proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 13.3 Evidential burden of proof--defence 
 
 
 
 (1) Subject to section 13.4 , a burden of proof that a law imposes on a defendant is an evidential burden only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 (2) A defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 (other than section 7.3) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 
 (3) A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 
 (4) The defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
 
 (5) The question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 (6) In this Code: 
 evidential burden , in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 
 
 13.4 Legal burden of proof--defence 
 
 
 
 A burden of proof that a law imposes on the defendant is a legal burden if and only if the law expressly: 
 
 
 (a) specifies that the burden of proof in relation to the matter in question is a legal burden; or 
 (b) requires the defendant to prove the matter; or 
 (c) creates a presumption that the matter exists unless the contrary is proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 
 

23 Senior Counsel for Mr Albarran relied on a number of other provisions of the Criminal Code which deal with the elements of an offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I will set out the provisions to which I was taken as follows:
 
 3.1 Elements 
 
 
 
 (1) An offence consists of physical elements and fault elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 4.1 Physical elements 
 
 
 
 (1) A physical element of an offence may be: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) conduct; or 
 (b) a result of conduct; or 
 (c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 
 
 
 5.1 Fault elements 
 
 
 
 (1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 
 
 5.2 Intention 
 
 
 
 (1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 (2) A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 (3) A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 
 
 
 5.3 Knowledge 
 
 
 
 
 A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 
 
 5.6 Offences that do not specify fault elements 
 
 
 
 (1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 (2) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists of a circumstance or a result, recklessness is the fault element for that physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 
 
 

24 Section 9.3 of the Criminal Code is also relevant to the consideration of the issues raised on this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I will set it out in full:
 
 9.3 Mistake or ignorance of statute law 
 
 
 
 (1) A person can be criminally responsible for an offence even if, at the time of the conduct constituting the offence, he or she is mistaken about, or ignorant of, the existence or content of an Act that directly or indirectly creates the offence or directly or indirectly affects the scope or operation of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply, and the person is not criminally responsible for the offence in those circumstances, if the Act is expressly to the contrary effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 
 
 

 The Issues 
 
25 Three issues arise in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The first issue is whether reliance on legal advice amounts to reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">26 Senior counsel for ASIC submits that reliance upon legal advice cannot constitute reasonable excuse; to permit such an excuse to be raised would be to defeat the very purpose of the proceeding before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">27 Nevertheless, senior counsel for Mr Albarran points to the provisions of the Criminal Code set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The essence of his submissions is that Mr Albarran's evidence before me discharges the evidential burden referred to in s 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">28 The second issue is whether Mr Albarran received the legal advice that he claims to have relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This is an issue of fact which turns upon whether I accept his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">29 The third issue is whether, even if Mr Albarran received the advice that he claims, reliance upon it was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">This issue turns upon the nature of the advice said to have been received and the circumstances in which the advice was communicated to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">30 In order to determine the second and third issues, it is necessary to set out the relevant factual background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">An important part of this centres upon an application made by Mr Albarran, several weeks prior to his attendance before the Board to give evidence, to be excused from attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">31 That application was unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">What was said by Mr Albarran's legal advisers, and by ASIC, prior to the hearing of the application, and by the Board Chairman, Mr Magarey, are critical to the determination of the issues before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The Factual Background 
 
32 On 23 December 2005, a Panel of the Board, constituted inter alia by Mr Magarey, in an application made by ASIC, found that Mr Albarran had failed within the meaning of s 1292(d)(ii) of the Corporations Act , to carry out or perform, adequately and properly, the duties or functions required by an Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
33 The relevant finding of the Board was that Mr Albarran had participated in a contrived nominee arrangement to appoint two persons as administrators of Formula Engineering while he or his firm, Hall Chadwick:
 
 ...in effect, were to, or actually did, perform functions of the appointed Administrator in respect of which his firm was to, and did receive, fees for work performed in circumstances where he himself and any member of his firm was precluded from accepting the appointment ... because he had a conflict of interest as a result of the prior professional relationship with Formula Engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 

 Although the Board concluded that Mr Albarran participated in contrived nominee arrangements, it found that he had no part in their creation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Moreover, the Board did not find that Mr Albarran acted dishonestly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">34 The gravamen of the Board's finding against Mr Albarran was that he did not properly understand his professional duty, or did not give it sufficient consideration, or simply ignored it; a reasonably competent liquidator would have given consideration to and understood that the contrived arrangements were contrary to published professional codes and standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">35 On 3 May 2006, the Board made orders against Mr Albarran in his disciplinary proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">On 8 May 2006, Mr Albarran made application to the AAT for a review of the adverse determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 
36 Before the date of the Board's determination in 2005, Mr Albarran instituted proceedings in the High Court for a Constitutional writ to prohibit the Board from taking further steps in the disciplinary proceeding against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The matter was remitted to the Federal Court which dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Special leave to appeal was granted by the High Court on 29 September 2006 but the appeal was ultimately unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">37 On 27 June 2006, at the request of ASIC, the Panel Chairman of the proceeding against the Partner issued a summons to Mr Albarran to appear before the Board on 18 December 2006 in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The summons was served on 18 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">38 In November 2006, the solicitors who were acting for Mr Albarran in his disciplinary proceeding gave consideration as to whether he could decline to appear in answer to the summons to attend before the Board in the Partner's matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The solicitors who were acting were NOTLawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The relevant persons were Mr Simon Gallant, a partner in that firm, and Mr David Blessington, an employed solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">39 On 21 November 2006, Mr Blessington attended a conference with Mr AJ Sullivan QC and Mr K Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr Sullivan was briefed as senior counsel for the Partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Mr Eassie was briefed to appear for Mr Albarran in his disciplinary proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">40 Mr Blessington's notes of the meeting include the following:
 
 Section 219 "reasonable excuse" 
 
 Think should make submission to Chairperson of the Board --- if deny (?</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">) --- 
 219(7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 Options - CALB 
 
 
 
 AAT 
 
 
 
 Federal Court 
 
 Prejudice --- "de novo" hearing before the AAT 
 
 
 Issue of claim by ASIC that can introduce fresh contentions in the AAT proceedings could also be of relevance here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 
 
 Being compelled to give evidence in proceedings which may prejudice our position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">
 
 
 ... 
 
 Best strategy would be for RA to attend on 18/12 --- get ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 If adverse we --- 
 
 have decision 
 
 either give evidence or walk out 
 
 ... 
 Letter to ASIC should consider "reasonable excuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
 
 Eassie to research issue of "reasonable excuse" plus section 219 of ASIC Act --- look to second reading speech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 

41 Following that conference Mr Blessington sent an email to Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The email was sent in the afternoon of 21 November 2006 and it was copied to Mr Sullivan, Mr Eassie and Mr Gallant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It included the following:
 
 I met with Alan Sullivan and Kerry Eassie this morning to get advice on the way forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">
 
 All are reasonably confident that appropriate steps can be taken to prevent you giving evidence but of course, no guarantees can be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">
 
 Kerry and I had drafted a letter to ASIC setting out why it is inappropriate that you give evidence in [the Partner's] proceedings but Alan wants it expanded to include the bases for you having "reasonable excuse" for not attending/giving evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">That expression is used in s 219 of the ASIC Act but research will have to be done as to the meaning it has been given in other cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">

42 On 12 December 2006 Mr Blessington wrote to ASIC contending that the summons issued to Mr Albarran in the Partner's proceeding was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Serious allegations were made against ASIC including a contention that the summons was issued for the collateral purpose of a "dress rehearsal" of Mr Albarran's proceeding in the AAT and a conflict of interest on the part of the Panel in the Partner's proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">43 It is not suggested that the letter was settled by Mr Sullivan or Mr Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">44 The letter of 12 December 2006 included the following statement:
 
 In these circumstances, it would appear to be the case that the Summons was issued for an improper purpose, and should accordingly be held to be invalid, as an abuse of process (see Ganin v NSW Crime Commission (1993) 32 NSWLR 423).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">As well, and as a separate ground, Albarran relies upon what was said in the High Court in Taikato v R [1996] HCA 28 ; 139 ALR 386, that what amounts to a "reasonable excuse" depends not only on the circumstances of the individual case, but also on the purpose of the provision to which the defence of "reasonable excuse" is an exception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">CALDB is obliged pursuant to s.218(2) of the ASIC Act to observe the rules of natural justice "... at and in connection with a hearing ", and we submit that the matters referred to above, considered together, plainly constitute a reasonable excuse for him not to attend the hearing of the [Partner's] Proceedings to give evidence (Section 219(1) of the ASIC Act ), as well as for refusing to comply otherwise with Section 219 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">
 
 

45 Mr Blessington concluded his letter by stating that if ASIC did not agree not to call Mr Albarran in response to the summons, the solicitors had instructions to make an application to set it aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">46 ASIC replied on 14 December 2006 stating that it would not agree not to call Mr Albarran at the hearing of the Partner's matter which had been reconvened to commence on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">ASIC denied the "baseless allegation" that the summons was issued for an improper purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">ASIC observed that the summons was sought for the legitimate forensic purpose of having Mr Albarran available to give evidence relevant to ASIC's case for orders against the Partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">47 Importantly, ASIC's letter of 14 December 2006 made it clear that the evidence which ASIC sought to adduce from Mr Albarran in the Partner's matter was the same evidence he had given in his own matter before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">48 This is clearly stated in the following paragraph of ASIC's letter of 14 December 2006:
 
 There is no "dress rehearsal" of Mr Albarran's evidence for the AAT Proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">ASIC merely seeks to adduce from Mr Albarran the same evidence which he has already given at his own CALDB proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">ASIC has provided Mr Albarran with a copy of the transcript of the evidence he gave at his own CALDB proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">ASIC has also provided him with an outline of the evidence which ASIC expects to adduce from him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The outline is a summary of the evidence which Mr Albarran gave at his own CALDB proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 

49 On 15 December 2006 Mr Blessington forwarded a copy of ASIC's letter of 14 December 2006 to Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Blessington stated that "Its contents are predictable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">" 
 
50 On 19 December 2006 Mr Blessington wrote to the Board stating that Mr Albarran wished to make an application to the Panel hearing the Partner's proceeding, in the following terms:
 
 
 1. that he be excused and/or released from further attendance in response to the Summons pursuant to Section 219(1)(b) of the ASIC Act ; 
 
 
 
 In the alternative: 
 
 
 
 2. that pursuant to sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 219 of the ASIC Act he be excused from attendance in response to the Summons by reason of reasonable excuse in accordance of Section 219(2A) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 
 

51 On 17 January 2007 a conference took place in the boardroom of NOTLawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Albarran and the Partner were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">So too were Mr Blessington and Mr Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It appears that Mr Gallant was also in attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">52 The notes of the meeting commence with the comment that:
 
 We do not want RA to give evidence in [the Partner's] matter because of possible detrimental effect on AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 

53 The notes also state that Mr Albarran's position "is different to" the Partner's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">54 The Partner is recorded in the notes as having made reference to the possibility of Mr Albarran raising the privilege against self-incrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Eassie's response is recorded in the following terms:
 
 that is not clear on the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Should focus on reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">
 

55 The notes of the conference of 17 January 2007 record that Mr Albarran asked what would happen if he refused to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The notes continue as follows:
 
 - read s 219 
 
 - contempt --- difficult issues 
 
 
 - jail --- possible 
 
 
 

56 On 18 January 2007 Mr Albarran sent an email to Mr Blessington asking him to consider certain comments made by the Partner on the applicability of the privilege against self-incrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Whatever discussion took place between Mr Albarran and Mr Blessington about that topic, it is clear that privilege against self-incrimination was not raised before Mr Magarey or when Mr Albarran appeared to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">57 Mr Magarey held a pre-hearing conference on 22 January 2007 to deal with Mr Albarran's application to be excused from attendance in response to the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Mr Magarey also dealt, at the same time, with an application by the Partner that the summons against Mr Albarran should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">58 Mr Magarey gave his ruling on both applications on 25 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He rejected both of them in a detailed set of rulings and reasons delivered on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">59 The ruling contains two important preliminary comments about Mr Albarran's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">First, Mr Magarey observed that there may be an argument that no application of this nature could be made until there was a failure to attend or to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">However, Mr Magarey accepted Mr Albarran's submission that it was realistic to deal with the application on an anticipatory basis, there being said to be a basis which would constitute a reasonable excuse for an anticipated failure to attend or to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">60 Mr Magarey continued by saying:
 
 I should add that the result of any ruling I give on that anticipatory basis will be that no party will be able to challenge that ruling before the Panel or otherwise to act contrary to that ruling but that no party will be precluded from making any other application under s219, based on grounds other than those on which submissions have been made in connection with the present applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I understand that the parties do not disagree with this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">
 

61 The second important preliminary comment was as to the meaning of "reasonable excuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Mr Magarey said:
 
 It seems to me that the purpose of s 217 is to give the Board wide powers to summon witnesses and that s 219 is intended to give enforceability to that except in cases of "reasonable excuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It further seems that that expression in s 219 is to recognise that (in addition to physical excuses such as sickness, transport strikes, etc) there may be good reasons affecting that particular person which should justify an excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">However, I take the purpose of the expression in s 219 to be that unless there can be established (to my satisfaction in this case) some particular prejudice to the particular person which is such as to displace the general presumption of compliance with the summons then the general purpose of compliance should be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 

62 Mr Magarey then proceeded to reject each of the nine submissions put forward by counsel for Mr Albarran as to why he would have reasonable excuse for not attending or refusing to answer questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">As to the "dress rehearsal" submissions, Mr Magarey said:
 
 Since there is no indication that ASIC will seek to adduce any evidence from Albarran other than that which he gave in the Albarran proceedings, I do not see how that can be of prejudice to Albarran such as to amount to a reasonable excuse not to answer the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 

63 At about 12.45 pm on 25 January 2007, Mr Blessington forwarded a copy of Mr Magarey's ruling to Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Mr Blessington also sent a copy to Mr Gallant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">64 Later in the afternoon of 25 January 2007 Mr Blessington had a conversation with Mr Albarran about Mr Magarey's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Mr Blessington's note records that he told Mr Albarran that they needed to discuss the "next move".</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The note also records the following:
 
 He sd wd not be answering q's if he thought wd prejudice his position in AAT as "they can take me to the Federal Court" if they want.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">
 

65 On 1 February 2007 Mr Gallant sent an email to Mr Albarran stating that he had discussed the matter with Mr Blessington who was of the view that Mr Eassie should renew Mr Albarran's application to be excused from further attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Gallant noted Mr Albarran's instructions that he would prefer Mr Blessington to make the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">66 Mr Gallant's email suggested the following form of answer when Mr Albarran wished to raise "reasonable excuse" for not answering:
 
 Mr Chair, I have a matter currently before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and believe that answering this question may prejudice my interests in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I believe I have a reasonable excuse not to answer that question and will not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">

67 The Panel appointed to hear the Partner's matter re-commenced sitting on 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Mr Albarran attended with Mr Blessington on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The hearing before the Panel on 7 February 2007 
 
68 I will set out the transcript of the most salient parts of the hearing on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It is unnecessary to set out the exchanges that took place in relation to every one of the 37 questions the subject of the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Mr Albarran's approach is sufficiently revealed by the portions of the transcript set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">69 The following exchange took place in relation to the first of the 37 questions asked by Mr Speakman who appeared for ASIC: 
 
 MR SPEAKMAN: Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">As a salaried partner, were you given directions from time to time by equity partners to undertake tasks in 2000?</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Are you seeking to establish the difference between salaried partners and equity partners?</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">
 
 MR SPEAKMAN: Yes, I am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: It is a general question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">I will allow the question and I can't see the need to confer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">It doesn't specifically relate to anything here except background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">
 
 THE WITNESS: Mr Chairman, I have currently a matter before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and I believe that answering this question may prejudice my interests in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I believe I have a reasonable excuse not to answer that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">At this point in time, I'm not able to answer that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">I'm happy to return, once my appeal has been concluded, and answer that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Mr Albarran, if you take that attitude to that question, when you are asked specific questions that directly relate to this case you are not going to be much help to us, are you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 THE WITNESS: I believe not, Mr Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: That will involve your appearance here being virtually useless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 
 THE WITNESS: In relation to that, [the Partner] wasn't required at my hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">I can't see such a big issue about me being required at [the Partner's] hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">To me, it seems that ASIC want to have a go at me before they get to my appeal, but that's just simply me as a layman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Mr Albarran, the opportunity to canvass your presence here has been given and a ruling has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It is binding, I think, on the parties and on you to the extent that you made the application, so you have to accept the fact that you are here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">If you come here and refuse to answer reasonable questions relating to this case, then you negative that ruling and you are of no value as a witness to anyone in this case, so we can't allow that to happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 
 THE WITNESS: Mr Chairman, I'm not refusing to answer the questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">At this point in time, I'm not in a position to answer the questions because of my position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">There's a difference between refusing to answer the question and not being in a position to answer the question because of my position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: There really is no difference in kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 THE WITNESS: There is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: We don't get an answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">This Panel can only proceed on the basis that witnesses answer legitimate questions that are put to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Otherwise, there is no point in calling the witness, for whatever reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 
 THE WITNESS: I appreciate that, Mr Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: The question is a generic question as to the difference in the roles and duties of salaried and equity partners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It would seem that I have already ruled that there is a legitimate question if it is sufficiently clear to you what the question is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It is not a question on which I think you should need to confer, because we have ruled that the evidence here, in the opinion of the Panel, will not incriminate you in your own case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">
 
 THE WITNESS: Well, I believe differently and my legal advisers believe differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">So, again, if you want me to answer the question, Mr Chair, I have a matter currently before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">I believe that answering this question may prejudice my interests in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">I believe I have a reasonable excuse not to answer that question and cannot do so at this point in time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Mr Albarran, did you raise that issue before the Chairman of the Board, that you presence here would prejudice you in your case, in your proceedings?</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">
 
 THE WITNESS: I would have to confer on that, because I wasn't present on 22 January, but I believe it was raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">My lawyers were present, so can I confer?</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: You certainly can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">
 
 THE WITNESS: Can I get Mr Blessington to speak on that behalf, because I wasn't present, but I'm pretty positive that, yes, it was raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: I will put the position of the Panel quite clearly to you and to Mr Blessington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">You, through counsel, made an application to be excused from the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">My understanding is that that was argued at some length and that a decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">That decision was that you were not excused from attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 Now it appears to the Panel that you have come here today not accepting that decision and subverting it, if you like, by not being prepared to answer questions, which has the same effect as overcoming the decision of the Chairman that you are required to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">There is no point in you coming here and nor answering questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">It's just as if you are not here at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 
 THE WITNESS: No, Mr Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">I believe your statement is incorrect there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">I believe that the reason that the Chairman required my attendance here today is because, at that point in time, there was no knowledge of what questions were going to be asked and he couldn't possibly say whether I would or I wouldn't have a reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">But, clearly, the questions that are being asked and are being put to me relate to my case and I believe I have a reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">If you go to the Chairman's ruling, that was his ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Have you seen the evidence to be adduced?</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Have you seen the document produced by ASIC, "Evidence to be adduced by Mr Albarran"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">
 
 THE WITNESS: I haven't read it, no, Mr Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Has it been sent to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">
 
 THE WITNESS: It has been sent to me, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: So you are on notice of the precise questions that ASIC is going to put to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">
 
 THE WITNESS: No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Why not?</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 
 THE WITNESS: Because they could ask a lot of other questions and not the precise questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: We have been provided with this list of questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">I am ticking off straight down the list, and there hasn't been a question asked here that is not on this list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">
 
 THE WITNESS: I've been asked four questions, so are you saying that throughout the day I wouldn't be asked any more questions apart from --- 
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: I'm not saying that at all, but I'm saying that you are at least on notice that you will be asked the questions on this list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">
 
 THE WITNESS: Maybe some of them I wouldn't be asked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Maybe not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">But to the extent that you are asked questions on this list, you are on notice of the questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 THE WITNESS: I haven't read the questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: You had the opportunity t read them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 THE WITNESS: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 

70 After this exchange took place, Mr Blessington addressed the Panel Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">He contended that the ruling of Mr Magarey related to "the first limb" of s 219, whether or not Mr Albarran had reasonable excuse not to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Mr Blessington contended that Mr Albarran was entitled to rely on "the second limb" of s 219 which related to answering specific questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">71 There was then some further discussion, after which Mr Speakman addressed the Panel Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Mr Speakman referred to Mr Magarey's observation about the anticipatory basis of the application to be excused from attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">He pointed to Mr Magarey's statement that it was not open to Mr Albarran to agitate the matters he had relied upon in his application to be excused from attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">72 The following exchange then took place between the Panel Chairman and Mr Blessington:
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: Perhaps I should short-circuit this by asking Mr Blessington, are there any grounds you're putting to us today for Mr Albarran refusing to answer that particular question that are not already covered by the application not to attend and as summarised in paragraph 4, subsections (a) though (i) of the Chairman's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">
 
 MR BLESSINGTON: Most certainly, Mr Chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: And what are they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">
 
 MR BLESSINGTON: His objection is his claim to have reasonable excuse must be considered in relation to each question which is asked of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">This ruling, despite what ASIC claims, is in relation to the first limb of section 219, nothing more, that is, whether he had reasonable excuse not to comply with the summons to be here, and he is here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">
 
 The issue before the Panel now is whether, in relation to a question put to him, he has reasonable excuse at the time not to answer it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">That could not have been covered by the Chairman, because he did not know the questions which were going to be put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">He didn't have in front of him, so far as I'm aware, the list of questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">They were not contemplated, they were not tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">How could that possibly be the case?</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">
 
 THE CHAIRMAN: But the question of a reasonable excuse is common, I think, to both applications and if the Chairman rejected as a reasonable excuse for not attending those excuses, I'm putting to you that this Panel will also reject as a reasonable excuse for not answering questions the same material that has already been put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 

73 The hearing proceeded but Mr Albarran declined to answer the questions which are the subject of the Panel Chairman's certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Mr Albarran used slightly different formulation in relation to some of his refusals but the effect of each was that Mr Albarran had a matter currently before the AAT and he believed that answering the question may prejudice his interests in that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">He said he believed he had a reasonable excuse and would not be able to answer "at this point in time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">74 When asked to elaborate on the question of reasonable excuse, Mr Speakman observed that there could not be reasonable excuse to refuse to answer a question on the basis that it would prejudice the AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Mr Speakman continued:
 
 There can't be any reasonable apprehension of a prejudice to the AAT proceedings by giving evidence that confirms evidence previously given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">There's no implicit concession in that submission that if any evidence went beyond this transcript there would be prejudice, but at least on this narrow question there can't be any prejudice in being asked to give the same evidence that's been given before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">
 

75 Notwithstanding this, Mr Albarran declined to answer the 37 questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">At the conclusion of Mr Albarran's evidence, the Panel Chairman stated to him, the Panel "does appreciate your position... and that you are acting on legal advice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">However, the Chairman pointed out that the absence of his answers prejudiced the matter before the Panel which was left to make what it could of the "patchwork quilt" of Mr Albarran's answers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">76 This was a reference to the fact that Mr Albarran did answer some questions that were put to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Whether reliance on legal advice constituted "reasonable excuse" 
 
77 Even if Mr Albarran received and acted upon the advice he asserts, in my opinion this did not constitute "reasonable excuse" within the meaning of s 219 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">78 The authorities on the scope of "reasonable excuse" as a ground of exculpation from the operation of a statutory prescription were comprehensively analysed and explained by Hely J in Bank of Valletta PLC v National Crime Authority (1999) 164 ALR 45 at [36] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">79 Justice Hely's explanation of the authorities indicates that the proper construction of "reasonable excuse" in s 219 is consistent with the view taken by Mr Magarey, as set out at [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">That is to say, the person seeking to rely upon it must establish some particular prejudice which is sufficient to displace the assumption of compliance with the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">80 In Valletta , Hely J referred to authorities of the High Court, the New South Wales Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Three propositions may be gleaned from his Honour's analysis of those authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">81 First, the question of what constitutes "reasonable excuse" is to be determined from the terms and structure of the particular statute and the circumstances of each particular case: Valletta at [39], [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">82 Second, reasonable excuse is not confined to physical or practical difficulties in complying with the statutory prescription.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It includes any excuse which would be accepted by a reasonable person as sufficient to justify non-compliance, but it is necessary to bear in mind the importance of the particular statutory prescription to the overall statutory regime: Valletta at [42].</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">83 Third, the question of what constitutes reasonable excuse involves an objective determination in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">These include the adverse consequences to an individual of being compelled to answer and the adverse consequences to an inquiry if the questions are not answered: Valletta at [44], [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">84 Applying these principles, it is quite plain that reliance on legal advice as a ground of reasonable excuse would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme contained in particular in s 1292 of the Corporations Act and ss 68 , 217 and 219 of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">85 The primary function of the Board is to hear disciplinary proceedings brought by ASIC in respect of auditors and liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Privilege against self-incrimination and privilege against exposure to a penalty do not constitute reasonable excuse for failing to answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">It seems to me that the Board's statutory functions would be rendered otiose if reliance on legal advice were to constitute reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">86 In my view, support for this proposition is to be found in the remarks of the High Court in Ostrowski v Palmer [2004] HCA 30 ; (2004) 218 CLR 493 at [2] per Gleeson CJ and Kirby J; at [53] --- [54] per McHugh J; and at [85] per Callinan and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">87 The point was put in strong terms by Callinan and Heydon JJ at [85] as follows:
 
 A mockery would be made of the criminal law if accused persons could rely on, for example, erroneous legal advice, or their own often self-serving understanding of the law as an excuse for breaking it... 
 
 

88 It is true that in Ostrowski their Honours were concerned with s 24 of the Criminal Code (WA) which applied to mistakes about the factual ingredients of an offence, not mistakes about the existence of the law creating the offence, or to the question of reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">However, the approach stated by their Honours is applicable by analogy in the present context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">89 In Re Modern Woodcraft Pty Limited (In Liquidation) (1997) 75 FCR 245 at 253-254, Lindgren J appears to have considered that reliance on legal advice was reasonable excuse for failure to file affidavits within the time limited for the purpose of s 597A(3) of the Corporations Law .</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Nevertheless, for the reasons stated by his Honour at 254, that decision is confined to its own facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The defendant's approach to the construction and effect of s 219 of the ASIC Act is rejected 
 
90 The Court's jurisdiction is enlivened under s 219(7) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">That sub-section falls to be considered in its own terms, in its full statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">91 Section 219(7) is in the nature of a contempt proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It provides that if the Court is satisfied that the person to whom a certificate has been given has "without reasonable excuse" failed to comply with a requirement stated in the certificate, the Court may punish the person "in the same manner as if he or she had been guilty of contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">"
 
92 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534, 545, the High Court said that proceedings for contempt must be seen as criminal in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It follows that charges must be proved to the criminal standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">It does not follow that every provision of the Criminal Code is imported into the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">93 The note under s 219(2A) of the ASIC Act refers to s 13.3 of the Criminal Code in an aid to the construction of s 219(7) and part of the statutory context: Pearce, D C &amp; Geddes, R S, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (6 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2006) at [4.49].</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">But it does not follow from this that the provisions of Ch 2 of the Criminal Code dealing with the General Principles of Criminal Responsibility are applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">94 As the learned authors of Federal Criminal Law (LexisNexis Butterworths, 1994) observe at [5A-015] observe:
 
 The essence of Ch 2 of the Criminal Code is to do away with the concepts of actus reus and mens rea and to replace them with a mechanism requiring all federal offences to be divided up...into so-called "physical" and "fault" elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">
 

95 Even if the provisions of Ch 2 are applicable, in my opinion, the absence of reasonable excuse is not a physical element of the offence created by s 219(2) (4) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Rather, it is in the nature of a fault element within s 5.1 of the Criminal Code .</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">96 Senior counsel for Mr Albarran sought, in my view incorrectly, to treat the absence of reasonable excuse as a physical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">He then sought to argue that the prosecutor was required to prove that Mr Albarran intended to refuse to answer the question without reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">I reject that submission as contrary to the terms of s 219(2) , (2A) and (4) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">97 Section 219(2A) imposed an evidentiary burden on Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The question which arises before me under s 219(7) is whether I am satisfied that the burden has been discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">98 The view which I have reached that reliance on legal advice cannot amount to "reasonable excuse" disposes of the matter but even if I am wrong on that question, I am not satisfied that Mr Albarran has discharged the burden upon him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Moreover, even if the absence of reasonable excuse is a physical element, I am satisfied of this element beyond reasonable doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Whether Mr Albarran received any relevant advice 
 
99 Mr Albarran asserts that he believed he had a reasonable excuse for declining to answer questions on 7 February 2007 because he claims to have received legal advice to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">100 I accept that Mr Albarran received advice from Mr Gallant and Mr Blessington prior to the conference of 21 November 2006 that Mr Albarran "may have a reasonable excuse" not to attend the hearing which was, at that stage, scheduled to take place in December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">101 I also accept that the preliminary advice given by those solicitors was confirmed in the letter of 21 November 2006 following upon Mr Blessington's conference with Mr Sullivan and Mr Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">But the letter did not convey the advice in unqualified terms because the confidence expressed in the opening words of the second sentence is tempered by the statement that "no guarantees can be given.</sentence>

102 However, that advice, such as it was, related only to the question of whether Mr Albarran had a reasonable excuse for not attending before the Board in answer to the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Once Mr Magarey's ruling was handed down on 25 January 2007, the relevant question was whether Mr Albarran received legal advice that he had reasonable excuse for not answering the questions that were put to him when he appeared before the Panel on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">103 It is true that Mr Albarran was accompanied at the hearing on 7 February 2007 by Mr Blessington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">It might be inferred from this, and from what Mr Blessington said before the Panel that Mr Albarran was acting on legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The Panel Chairman's remark which I have recorded at [75] might also be thought to support that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">104 However, the content of any advice which Mr Albarran might be thought to have acted on 7 February 2007 was not established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Nor was the occasion on which it was given established on the evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Accordingly, upon a careful consideration of the whole of the evidence, I reject Mr Albarran's contention that he received or acted upon legal advice that he had reasonable excuse for not answering the 37 questions which he was required to answer before the Panel on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">105 There are four reasons for this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">First, Mr Albarran was an unsatisfactory witness and I reject critical aspects of his evidence as untruthful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Second, his evidence was not supported, and was in some respects contradicted by Mr Gallant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Third, Mr Blessington was not called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Fourth, the entire documentary record is inconsistent with a finding that Mr Albarran received legal advice in the terms that he asserts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">I will expand on these reasons below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">106 Mr Albarran commenced his evidence-in-chief by stating that Mr Blessington told him that after reviewing the matter, Mr Sullivan and Mr Eassie believed that Mr Albarran "may have a reasonable excuse" for not attending the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Not long after, he said the advice that Mr Blessington conveyed to him was that Mr Sullivan and Mr Eassie were "of a firm opinion" that he had a reasonable excuse for not attending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">107 This later evidence was, plainly, an embellishment of what Mr Albarran said at the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">It was contrary to the evidence given by Mr Gallant who said that after the conference with counsel he confirmed his firm's preliminary view to Mr Albarran that he "may" have a reasonable excuse for not answering the summons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">108 Moreover, Mr Albarran's evidence is contrary to the only contemporaneous written record of the advice that was communicated to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">That advice was contained in the letter of 21 November 2006 which was qualified by the statement that no guarantees could be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">109 Mr Albarran agreed that he had produced, in response to a notice to produce given to him by ASIC, all documents that he and his solicitors had been able to locate that recorded advice given to Mr Albarran on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">As I have said, none of them supported him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">110 Moreover, in spite of the clear terms of the statement in the letter of 21 November 2006, Mr Albarran would not accept that the words "no guarantees could be given" qualified the terms of the advice that preceded it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Mr Albarran's credit was adversely affected by his refusal to accept the obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">111 A further example of this was Mr Albarran's evidence that the Partner wanted him to give evidence at the hearing of the Partner's matter before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">112 Mr Albarran's evidence on that issue is contradicted by the note of the conference of 17 January 2007 set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The Partner raised the possibility of Mr Albarran claiming privilege against self-incrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The only conceivable explanation for the Partner's suggestion was that he did not want Mr Albarran to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">113 Indeed, the Partner persisted in this approach after the conference, as is recorded in Mr Albarran's email to Mr Blessington of 18 January 2007 forwarding the comments by the Partner as to his view, namely, that privilege against self-incrimination may be claimed by Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">114 What is more, Mr Magarey's ruling of 25 January 2007 deals not only with Mr Albarran's application to be excused from attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Mr Magarey also dealt with the Partner's application that the summons against Mr Albarran should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">115 Notwithstanding the overwhelming body of evidence against him, Mr Albarran stubbornly refused to depart from his statement that the Partner wanted him to give evidence before the Board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">116 Another example of the unsatisfactory nature of Mr Albarran's evidence is to be found in his assertion that at the conference of 17 January 2007 Mr Eassie was of the "very strong opinion" that Mr Albarran had a reasonable excuse not to attend, and that even if he did attend, not to answer questions that may affect his AAT appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">117 Mr Eassie was not called but the note of what he said at the conference is inconsistent with the proposition that any such advice was given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">118 Mr Blessington's note records that Mr Eassie said that the right to claim privilege against self-incrimination was not clear and "(s)hould focus on reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">" If Mr Eassie had gone beyond this and given "a very strong opinion" that Mr Albarran had reasonable excuse, it would have been recorded in Mr Blessington's note, which on its face, contains a comprehensive record of what was said at the conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">119 Mr Albarran was taken to the note but he clung to his earlier evidence, insisting that Mr Eassie said that it was his "opinion or it was his firm opinion" that Mr Albarran had a reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">120 Despite his professional qualifications as a chartered accountant, Mr Albarran's evidence was that he did not read Mr Magarey's ruling of 25 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Having regard to his overall approach to the matter, I am inclined to accept this piece of evidence, although his failure to read it reflects adversely upon the third limb of the argument, namely the "reasonableness" of his professed excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">121 However, I do not accept Mr Albarran's evidence of the terms in which the content of Mr Magarey's ruling was conveyed to Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">His evidence was that he was told that the basis of the ruling was that Mr Magarey could not know what questions were going to be put to Mr Albarran and whether those questions would be ones which, if answered, could affect his AAT proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">122 That was plainly not the basis on which the application was made to Mr Magarey or the basis of his ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The letter of 14 December 2006 from ASIC made it clear that the evidence which was to be sought from Mr Albarran was the same evidence he had given in his own disciplinary proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">That was why Mr Magarey was able to rule upon the first of the two preliminary points, namely that it was realistic to deal with the application on an anticipatory basis, it being known what the scope of the questions would be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">123 Mr Magarey's ruling expressly dealt with the application on the basis that there was no indication from ASIC that it would seek to adduce evidence from Mr Albarran other than that which he had given in his own proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">124 In light of this, I cannot accept that any of Mr Albarran's legal representatives conveyed the substance of the ruling in the terms stated by Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">To make a finding that the advice was in those terms would be to say that the legal representatives gave an entirely inaccurate account of the ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">That would be a most surprising result and there is no evidence before me (other than Mr Albarran's assertion) to support it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">125 Mr Albarran agreed that after Mr Magarey's ruling, he discussed what was to be done thereafter with Mr Gallant and Mr Blessington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Notwithstanding Mr Magarey's adverse ruling, Mr Albarran said that Mr Gallant and Mr Blessington gave firm advice that he still had a reasonable excuse for not answering questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">126 This evidence was contradicted by Mr Gallant who said that the question of whether Mr Albarran had a reasonable excuse was "not revisited in great depth" after Mr Magarey's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">127 Furthermore, in cross-examination on this topic, Mr Albarran departed from what he had said in chief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Mr Albarran said in chief that the people with whom he discussed Mr Magarey's ruling were Mr Gallant and Mr Blessington.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">He said they told him they were still "very confident" or still "confident" that he had a reasonable excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Yet in cross-examination Mr Albarran said, for the first time, that the advice was conveyed, albeit indirectly from Mr Sullivan and Mr Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Later he said he could not remember mention of Mr Sullivan but he said that Mr Gallant told him he had discussed it with Mr Eassie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">128 The documentary evidence discloses that there was a discussion between Mr Blessington and Mr Albarran on 25 January 2007 after Mr Magarey's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">But the terms of Mr Blessington's note, and Mr Albarran's answers to questions about it provide yet further reason for rejecting his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">129 The note of the conversation states in plain terms that Mr Albarran said he would not be answering questions if he thought it would prejudice him in the AAT and they could take him to the Federal Court if they wanted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">130 Notwithstanding this, Mr Albarran at first denied that he had spoken those words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">He persisted with this even after he was taken to the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Later, he gave a version of the conversation which was not supported by the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">This included the self-serving statement that Mr Blessington "believed strongly that I still had a reasonable excuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">No such words, or words touching on that subject, were contained in the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">131 Upon a careful consideration of the whole of Mr Albarran's evidence, I have come to the view that he has, without any foundation, convinced himself that advice was given even though it is plain that no such advice was received by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">No responsible lawyer could have given the advice that Mr Albarran asserts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Yet he persisted with his assertion and was not prepared to depart from it despite being taken to the overwhelming evidence against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">132 It is plain that he was prepared to run the risk of the consequences that would flow from his failure to answer the questions regardless of what was told by his lawyers and regardless of the obvious effect of Mr Magarey's adverse ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">133 It follows that I do not need to consider the third issue, namely "reasonableness" but I will do so briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Reasonableness 
 
134 In the face of Mr Magarey's ruling, no reasonable person could have held the view that he had a reasonable excuse for declining to answer questions that sought to adduce, in the Partner's matter, the same evidence that Mr Albarran had previously given in his own disciplinary proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">135 Nevertheless, Mr Albarran asserted that Mr Magarey's rejection of Mr Albarran's lawyer's arguments did not cause him to have doubt whether the advice be claimed to have received from his lawyers was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">136 There are only two possibilities that follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Either Mr Albarran's evidence as to this was false, or, if his evidence is to be accepted, his approach was entirely unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">137 So too with his evidence that he did not read Mr Magarey's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">This evidence was either false, or, alternatively, if he did not read the ruling, his approach was not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">No person, let alone a professional person, can be heard to assert the reasonableness of an excuse that relies upon a failure to read a document, which is central to a consideration of the excuse that is proffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Senior Counsel for Mr Albarran conceded that Mr Albarran's approach was cavalier, yet he asked me to accept it as reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">138 Even if I were to accept Mr Gallant's evidence that a view had been formed before Mr Magarey's decision was handed down, that there was a second limb to Mr Albarran's claim of reasonable excuse which may still be open after the ruling, it does not assist Mr Albarran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">This is because it is plain from the ruling that this excuse was not open in respect of questions that were intended to elicit evidence that had already been given by Mr Albarran in his own disciplinary proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">139 There was no suggestion before me that any of the 37 questions asked of Mr Albarran went beyond the subject matter of his evidence in the earlier proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Indeed, a schedule prepared by ASIC indicates that the questions did not go beyond those which had been the subject of Mr Albarran's earlier evidence and of which he was given notice in ASIC's letter of 14 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">140 I should add that I do not consider that Mr Gallant's evidence that "the view had been formed before the decision of Mr Magarey was handed down" that Mr Albarran may have a second limb to his approach, namely reasonable excuse not to answer, supports Mr Albarran's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In my view, the only fair reading of the evidence is that Mr Gallant was referring to advice given in November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">That advice was superseded by ASIC's communication of 14 December 2006 and by Mr Magarey's ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">141 The absence of any reasonable excuse is graphically illustrated by Mr Albarran's answer to the last line of questions put to him in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">142 The following exchange took place:
 
 If the evidence you gave in the Partner's proceedings was confined to the same evidence you had given in your own proceedings, how could you have been prejudiced by that?-- I may have been prejudiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Certain questions may have been answered differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">So that's how I could have been prejudiced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">
 

143 Even more graphic was Mr Albarran's attitude to giving evidence as is revealed in the file note of 17 January 2007 at [55].</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Despite his denials, I find that Mr Albarran was told that if he failed to answer questions before the Board without a reasonable excuse, he would commit a criminal offence and it was possible he would go to gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Conclusion and Orders 
 
144 I am satisfied that Mr Albarran, without reasonable excuse, failed or refused to answer the 37 questions which are the subject of the certificate given by the Panel Chairman under s 219(6) of the ASIC Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">145 If, as was submitted by Senior Counsel for Mr Albarran, I am required to be satisfied of the absence of reasonable excuse as a physical element, I am satisfied to the requisite standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Upon consideration of all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Albarran failed or refused to answer the questions without reasonable cause or excuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">146 I will order, pursuant to s 219(7)(b) of the ASIC Act that Mr Albarran be punished in the same manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">147 I propose to stand the matter over to a date to be fixed for the making of further orders on the question of punishment.</sentence>
