<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Mr Frank Anton is a self-employed builder and handyman who usually undertakes small renovations and maintenance jobs in and around his hometown of Hamilton in Western Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Between May 2005 and late 2006 or early 2007, Mr Anton performed work on a project called the Iluka Murray Basin Development Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The project included the construction of two plants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first was a mineral sands separation plant at Hamilton ("the Hamilton site") and the second was a mine unit and wet concrete plant at nearby Douglas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 This proceeding arose as a consequence of the interaction by Mr Anton with workers on the Hamilton site who were members of the first respondent, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the CFMEU").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The applicant, Mr Cruse, is a workplace inspector under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act ") and an Australian Building and Construction Commissioner under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the BCII Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He is entitled to bring this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Mr Cruse alleges that, in May 2005, the fourth respondent, Mr Fry, contravened s 298SC of the pre-Reform WR Act by making a false or misleading representation to Mr Anton about Mr Anton's obligation to join the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Mr Fry was employed at the Hamilton site and was a delegate of the CFMEU at that site at all material times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 Mr Cruse also alleges that Mr Fry breached s 170NC of the pre-Reform WR Act by taking action with intent to coerce Mr Anton to agree to make an enterprise bargaining agreement with the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 The second and third respondents, Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman were employed at the Hamilton site at all material times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is not in dispute that Mr Bannister was also a delegate of the CFMEU, but whether Mr Hoffman was such a delegate is in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">As it transpires, it is not necessary to resolve that dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Cruse alleges that Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman breached s 43(1) of the BCII Act by organising or taking action, or threatening to organise or take action, with intent to coerce the head contractor at the Hamilton site, Roche Mining (JR) Pty Ltd ("Roche"), not to:
 
&#8226; engage Mr Anton as a building contractor;
 
&#8226; allocate particular responsibilities to Mr Anton as a building contractor; or
 
&#8226; have Mr Anton given particular duties or responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The s 298SC issue 
 
6 At the Hamilton site a fence separated two areas which I will respectively call the construction side and the non-construction side of the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">From May 2005 until late August 2005, Mr Anton performed work exclusively outside the construction side in a fenced off area which was entered and exited through a gate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He performed work on transportable office structures such as fitting doors and air conditioners, as well as joining up transportable offices with metal trims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 Mr Anton gave evidence that Mr Fry approached him in May 2005 and told him that in order to perform work on the construction side of the project he had to be a member of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Anton denied that he asked Mr Fry about CFMEU membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Anton also said that Mr Fry told him that he could not work on the construction side until he had undertaken a full safety induction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Anton completed that induction on 24 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 Counsel for the respondents, Mr White, submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that Mr Fry said to Mr Anton that he could not work on the construction side of the site without being a CFMEU member as distinct from telling him he could not work there without being inducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">However, Mr Anton gave evidence that Mr Fry said to him "you know you've got to be in the union to work on this site" and "you can't work on this site unless you are in the union".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Mr White did not challenge Mr Anton in cross-examination on the veracity of that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Fry did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Although there are some aspects of Mr Anton's evidence which are confused and confusing, he was clear in his evidence that Mr Fry approached him and uttered the words referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 Section 298SC of the WR Act at the relevant time provided:
 A person must not make a false or misleading representation about: ... (c) another person's obligation to join an industrial association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 No issue arises in this proceeding whether Mr Fry made the relevant representation in good faith because he did not give evidence of his intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Objectively, the representation was false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">No obligation lay on Mr Anton to join the CFMEU before commencing work on the construction side of the Hamilton site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Consequently, the breach of s 298SC(c) of the WR Act against Mr Fry is established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The CFMEU is vicariously liable for Mr Fry's representation as a consequence of the operation of ss 298B(2)(b) and 349 of the WR Act as they applied at the relevant time: see Hadgkiss v Sunland Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 193 at 202-203 per Kiefel J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The s 170NC issue 
 
11 At the relevant time, s 170NC of the WR Act prohibited a person from taking or threatening to take any industrial action or other action with intent to coerce another person to agree to the making of an agreement under Division 2 or 3 of the WR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Mr Cruse contends that Mr Fry took "other action" within the meaning of s 170NC(1)(a) of the WR Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It is alleged that Mr Fry told Mr Anton that he had to leave the Hamilton site, and not return to it, until he entered into a certified agreement with the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">12 Mr Anton gave evidence that Mr Fry told him that he had to have an enterprise bargaining agreement to work on "this site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mr Anton said that he was told he "couldn't work there unless I had it" (meaning an agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Mr Anton said that, at that time, he stopped working, went home, and returned later with paperwork and payment to the CFMEU for an enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He said that he completed the work he was doing when he came back "on the site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Mr Anton gave evidence that he left the site because Mr Fry told him to leave the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">13 Under cross-examination Mr Anton said that Mr Fry told him that he had to have an enterprise bargaining agreement "to work on the construction site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He agreed that Mr Fry told him that he "couldn't work on the construction site without being inducted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">14 In National Tertiary Education Industry Union v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 441 ; (2002) 117 FCR 114 , Weinberg J considered the meaning of "other action" in s 170NC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">His Honour said at 138:
 The expression "other action" in s 170NC(1)(a) can be given a sensible interpretation if one reads it as including conduct of a kind taken by an employer, or employee, or an organisation registered under the Act, which related to the performance of work but is not included within the definition of "industrial action".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Picketing is one example of such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">At 138-139, Weinberg J noted the penal character of s 170NC and said that, as penal provisions are strictly construed, "other action" should not be given any "undue width".</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">15 The act of telling someone that that person is not permitted to engage in her or his business at a particular location without being party to a workplace agreement is within the concept of taking "other action" under s 170NC(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">16 As the Court said in Ponzio v Multiplex Ltd [2005] FCA 1410 ; (2005) 145 IR 431 at [73] , the provision is concerned with "fair play in the bargaining process, beyond the realms of protected action".</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Fair play in the bargaining process is impeded when one party to the bargain insists that an agreement be reached, otherwise the other party cannot continue with its business at a particular location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The same would apply if an employer told a worker she or he could not continue to be employed at a particular location unless the worker or her or his union agreed to a particular enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">17 The action of Mr Fry telling Mr Anton that he could not work on the construction side of the Hamilton site without being party to an enterprise bargaining agreement is "other action" within the scope of s 170NC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The next question is whether that action was taken with the intent to coerce Mr Anton into making an enterprise agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Anton, as a sole trader, had no obvious need for an enterprise agreement as he did not employ anyone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is beside the point that his entering into such an agreement allowed him to charge Roche a higher amount for his services than he previously obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">18 Intention to coerce requires intent to exert pressure that would in a practical sense negate choice: see National Tertiary Education Industry Union at 143.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Negation of choice can be contrasted with a desire to influence, persuade or induce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The question will be, as Weinberg J said in National Tertiary Education Industry Union at 143, whether "a person is left with a realistic choice as to whether or not to comply".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 Mr Anton gave evidence that he considered he had to obtain an enterprise agreement to work on the construction side of the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Mr Fry told him that that was so, he believed Mr Fry and considered that he had no choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Mr Fry contravened s 170NC by telling Mr Anton that he had to have an enterprise agreement to be able to work on the construction side of the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The exertion of such pressure involved unconscionable conduct which gave a party to the bargaining process no say in that process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">For the reason set out at [10] above, CFMEU is also vicariously liable for the breach of s 170NC by Mr Fry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The BCII Act issue 
 
20 The allegation that Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman breached the BCII Act stems from events which occurred in mid 2006 and culminated in a meeting on 4 July 2006 between CFMEU members on the construction side of the Hamilton site and two Roche representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">(i) Mr Anton's evidence on the BCII Act issue 
 
21 Mr Anton gave evidence that the work he performed for Roche at Hamilton was done pursuant to instructions given to him by Mr Armstrong and Mr Dann.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Armstrong was contracted to work for Roche on the Iluka project as the Civil Construction Superintendent from early 2005 until September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He supervised Mr Anton's work on a day to day basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr Dann is a construction manager who was employed by Roche as the Site Services Manager on the Iluka project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">22 Mr Anton said that he overheard Mr Bannister telling Mr Armstrong whilst in Mr Armstrong's office that he wanted Mr Anton off the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Anton said that after Mr Bannister left Mr Armstrong's office, he, Mr Anton, came across Mr Bannister who told him to leave the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Mr Anton said he then went off the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Under cross-examination Mr Anton agreed that he had no specific recollection of leaving the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Anton said that he continued to work on the non-construction side of the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I find this aspect of Mr Anton's evidence to be confused, confusing and improbable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Clearer accounts of the events of mid 2006 at the site are given by other witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">(ii) Mr Armstrong's evidence on the BCII Act issue 
 
23 Mr Armstrong gave evidence that there were CFMEU members employed on the construction side of the Hamilton site who were carpenters and known collectively as "the grouters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Mr Armstrong gave evidence that in June 2006, Mr Anton was performing work for Roche on a crib hut at the Hamilton site on the construction side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Anton was attaching trimming to join two halves of a portable structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This appears to have been the type of work he was originally doing in May 2005 on the non-construction side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Mr Armstrong said that, at this time, Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman came into his office and said that Mr Anton was not a member of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Mr Anton then showed Mr Bannister his membership card and obtained a copy of his enterprise bargaining agreement from his car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Mr Armstrong said that Mr Bannister asserted that Mr Anton should not be on site and then left Mr Armstrong's office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Mr Armstrong said that shortly after, Mr Bannister informed him that after checking with "a higher level official", Mr Bannister had told Mr Anton that "we can't stop you working on the site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Mr Armstrong said that from 23 June 2006 to 3 July 2006 he was on leave and heard no more about any concerns Mr Bannister had with Mr Anton until 4 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">24 Mr Armstrong gave evidence of a meeting on 4 July 2006 between himself and Mr Lee Mitchell (Construction Manager) representing Roche and ten grouters, including Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The meeting occurred in the grouters' crib hut and was arranged to discuss concerns the grouters had with work being given to Mr Anton which they asserted had been promised to them by Mr Bennett, an earlier supervisor on the Iluka project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">25 Mr Armstrong gave evidence that the grouters had an agreement with Roche to do all the grouting work on the site, but they wanted other work which Roche did not give them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He gave evidence that the grouters, who included Mr Hoffman and Mr Bannister, were told by Mr Bennett that they could perform part of the decommissioning work on the project if they were available when the 'pull-down' was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Mr Armstrong gave evidence that the grouters had told him that they had ordered specific materials for a job that they were to complete but that when the materials arrived Mr Anton was asked to finish the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">He said he gave the disputed work, which the grouters claimed as their work, to Mr Anton but it had not been promised to the grouters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Mr Armstrong said it was a job for which Mr Anton had "all the tools ... all the equipment ... everything to do the job in five minutes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">26 In his affidavit evidence, Mr Armstrong claimed that Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman said that they didn't want Mr Anton on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He also said that the grouters would not leave the crib hut until Mr Anton was sent off site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Under cross-examination, Mr Armstrong said he had no specific recollection whether Mr Hoffman said that the grouters would stay in the shed until Mr Anton left the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">He also had no specific recollection whether Mr Bannister made the same comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">27 It will be recalled that Mr Anton had no recollection when asked in his examination in chief of being asked to leave the Hamilton site in July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He said that at about that time Mr Armstrong told him that he wanted him to be "out there working full time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">(iii) Mr Mitchell's evidence on the BCII Act issue 
 
28 Mr Mitchell gave affidavit evidence that on 3 July 2006, Mr Bannister approached him and told him that the grouters were unhappy because Mr Anton had done work on the site that the grouters considered to be their work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Mitchell said that Mr Bannister told him if it was not sorted out "the boys would shed up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Under cross-examination, Mr Mitchell admitted telling an inspector from the Australian Building and Construction Commission that on 3 July 2006, Mr Bannister told him that the issue about Mr Anton doing work allegedly promised to the grouters "could" end up with the grouters sitting in their sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Mr Mitchell effectively disavowed any threat by Mr Bannister that the grouters "would shed up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">29 Mr Mitchell's affidavit evidence was that he did not know what Mr Armstrong had arranged with the grouters and that resolving the issue "would have to wait until the following morning, when [they] could all discuss the matter when [Mr] Armstrong was back".</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">30 Mr Mitchell gave affidavit evidence that Mr Bannister approached him at 8.15 am on 4 July 2006 and said that "the boys were still in the sheds and he wanted me to come and talk to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">" At the subsequent meeting, two of the grouters told him about work they had measured up and ordered materials for which was then given to Mr Anton by Mr Armstrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Mr Mitchell said that Mr Armstrong told him there was a half day's work involved in the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Mitchell told the grouters they could do the work and "suggested to [Mr Armstrong] that he get Frank [Anton] to finish up the other work".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Mitchell did so because he believed that the grouters would not otherwise leave the crib hut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He did not assert in his affidavit that Mr Hoffman or Mr Bannister made a demand that Mr Anton leave the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">(iv) Conclusions on BCII Act issue 
 
31 I am not satisfied that Mr Cruse has proven, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Hoffman or Mr Bannister organised or took action or threatened to organise or take action with intent to coerce Roche:
 
&#8226; not to engage Mr Anton as a building contractor;
 
&#8226; not to allocate particular responsibilities to Mr Anton; or
 
&#8226; to designate Mr Anton as not having particular duties or responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">32 The allegations that action was taken by Mr Hoffman and Mr Bannister to coerce Roche not to engage Mr Anton was only faintly pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Mr Anton was already engaged and did not cease to be engaged as a building contractor on 4 July 2006 by Roche.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Section 43(1)(b) of the BCII Act was not breached in respect of Mr Anton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">33 There is no persuasive evidence that Mr Hoffman or Mr Bannister said the grouters would stay in their crib hut until Mr Anton left the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Mr Armstrong, when pressed, could not specifically recall either man saying those words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The reality appears to be that the grouters believed they had been promised certain work which they had prepared for by measuring the job and ordering materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">They objected to Mr Anton doing that work in those circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">They asked for management to address the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The issue was addressed after the meeting with management which occurred in the grouter's crib hut or shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Hoffman or Mr Bannister said to Mr Armstrong or Mr Mitchell that the grouters would "shed up" unless Mr Anton was removed from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">34 Consequently, I am not satisfied that s 43(1)(b) or (c) of the BCII Act was breached by Mr Bannister or Mr Hoffman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Neither of them organised or took action, or threatened to organise or take action, with intent to coerce Roche not to allocate particular responsibilities or not have Mr Anton undertake particular duties or responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The advancement of a position in negotiations with management does not equate to coercion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This is especially so where the Court is not satisfied that any words were uttered or action taken by Mr Bannister or Mr Hoffman to negate Roche's choice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr Armstrong or Mr Mitchell were free to allocate the work to Mr Anton or the grouters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Their perception of what might happen if they granted the work to Mr Anton does not mean that the choice they made was affected by coercion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It was a choice they made on an assessment of possible industrial consequences as distinct from threatened industrial consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The possibility of industrial action occurring is not the same as a threat that industrial action would occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">35 The application, insofar as it raises alleged breaches of the BCII Act will in due course be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The only order the Court makes at this stage is to adjourn the proceeding to a directions hearing at 9.30 am on 4 September 2008 to program the balance of the proceeding which remains to be determined, that is, the taking of evidence and hearing of submissions on the penalty, if any, to be imposed on the CFMEU and/or Mr Fry for breaches of s 170NC and s 298SC(c) of the WR Act found to have occurred in accordance with these reasons.</sentence>
